&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. He hates the police.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/uk-ex-labour-party-leader-jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-antisemitism-mans-the-phones-for-zohran-mamdani/"&gt;Mamdani called &lt;/a&gt;the NYPD a “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His “apology” rings hollow, saying that it was for “the language that I used” — but not the sentiment. His plan for public safety would instead send “mental health teams” without police backup on 911 calls, because negotiation is key when you’re about to be shoved onto the subway tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. He really hates the police.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of officers in the NYPD is at its lowest levels in 20 years — below 34,000. Outgoing Mayor Adams wants to increase the ranks to 40,000 by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani insists on no additions — and is noncommittal about shrinking the agency. He claims he doesn’t want to “defund this rogue agency” as he has said in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he suggests that’s exactly what he’d do. “It’s not a question of headcount. It’s a question of safety,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/92-year-old-holocaust-survivor-votes-for-first-time-ever-to-back-cuomo-to-stop-mamdani/"&gt;Mamdani said recently.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. He hates the police — with a splash of antisemitism.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,” Mamdani claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/queens-democrat-party-snubs-own-assemblyman-zohran-mamdani-refuses-to-endorse-him-for-nyc-mayor/"&gt;To Zohran, &lt;/a&gt;a few collaborative training exercises between the Israel Defense Forces and the police department is a full-blown conspiracy theory. The NYPD draws on the experience of many groups (including for community outreach), but since Israel=Evil in Mamdani’s worldview, the program must end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. His mental-health plan is half-baked.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani is right that we need to help the mentally ill living on our streets, but he doesn’t have a realistic plan. He says his outreach teams will provide counseling, but any treatment program will be voluntary. How can someone who is mentally ill make decisions in their best interest? We’ve seen this movie before. Mayor Bill de Blasio spent $1 billion on his wife’s Thrive initiative, which prioritized a phone hot line. When schizophrenics told city workers they didn’t want to go to a shelter, they were allowed to sleep on the floor of a subway station. Expect more of the same — and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Promises a bus boondoggle.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani wants free buses for everyone, which he says will cost $700 million annually — though the head of the MTA predicts that will climb to $1 billion a year. That the same thing has been tried before and failed — numerous times! — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/obama-chats-with-mamdani-and-still-withholds-endorsement/"&gt;doesn’t phase Zohran.&lt;/a&gt; Kansas City ran out of money when it tried free buses. Olympia, Wash., had to raise sales taxes to pay for it. Meanwhile, in both those cities, as well as Portland, Ore., the quality of rides decreased. There was more vandalism; homeless camped out on them all day. We don’t often agree with The Washington Post, but its editorial board was absolutely right when it declared that “Parents would grow afraid to let their children ride alone,” as free buses become havens for drug users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. He’s never met a failed idea he didn’t like.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;span data-slideshow-modal="count"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Zohran Mamdani speaking at a campaign event in Queens. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism is bad, so let’s have a city-run grocery store with controlled prices! These stores wouldn’t have to pay property taxes, or rent, since they’d be in city-owned buildings. How many immigrant-owned bodegas will go out of business trying to compete against a store that gets such advantages? Details! Again, this has been tried before. And again, in places like Kansas City, city-run grocery stores were too expensive and unworkable. But that’s not going to stop Zohran!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. He wants to globalize the intifada.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/house-dem-leader-rails-that-mamdani-isnt-future-of-party-days-after-endorsing-him/"&gt;Mamdani refuses&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the phrase that calls for the destruction of Israel and the killing of Jews. New York already suffered when anti-Israel protesters marched through the streets, harassed Jewish residents and broke into a building at Columbia University. How much worse will it be under a Mayor Mamdani, who will encourage the protesters from inside City Hall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;8. He’ll cause an international incident.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani doesn’t like the NYPD, but he’s happy to order it to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It doesn’t matter that the US is not a party to the International Criminal Court, which indicted Netanyahu on trumped-up charges. It doesn’t matter that arresting him would likely violate federal law, torpedo our relationship with Israel, and embolden terrorist states — Mamdani’s hate for him must be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;9. He sides with hate.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani wrote and sang a rap song giving his “love” to the Holy Land Five, Americans who helped finance Hamas and were sent to prison for up to 65 years. He posed gleefully with Imam Siraj Wahhaj, an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. He sits for pleasant interviews with Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, who says the US “deserved 9/11.” His mentor was antisemite Linda Sarsour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;10. But then claims he’s the victim. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/cuomo-praises-adams-plan-to-hire-5k-more-nypd-cops/"&gt;Mamdani says Muslims &lt;/a&gt;are the real injured party here. He welled up at a press conference saying his aunt was scared to wear a hijab on the subway after the 9/11 terror attacks, as if there’s any sort of equation between the two. That the aunt turned out to be his father’s cousin, that her “fear” never had any manifestation of reality, and there was actually no proof to back up Mamdani’s tears? Quibbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;11. He’ll flood the streets with criminals.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani insists he’ll close Rikers by 2027, even though replacement jails in the boroughs are behind schedule. And even if they are built, they would hold 3,000 fewer inmates than the 7,000 currently held at Rikers. Despite the propaganda of the left, these aren’t people being held on misdemeanor drug arrests. Because of the “no bail” laws, most criminals aren’t locked up. Rikers therefore holds the worst of murderers, gang members, rapists — and Mamdani is saying let ’em go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;12. He’ll put children at risk for sex trafficking.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani has long wanted legal prostitution, which lowers the quality of life in neighborhoods and puts women at risk. “Decriminalizing” in Los Angeles has led to child sex trafficking, since police can’t stop prostitutes to make sure they are of age. Or what pimps might be exploiting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image__icon-text"&gt;
&lt;span data-slideshow-modal="count"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Zohran Mamdani speaks at a canvass launch in Harlem. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;13. He’ll make the housing crisis worse.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/us-news/mamdani-freezes-when-asked-for-details-on-how-hell-deliver-key-housing-promise/"&gt;promises to stack the Rent Guidelines Board&lt;/a&gt; with people who will freeze the cost of all rent-controlled apartments, about 30% of the city’s stock. That will make the market even less fluid, as people in rent-controlled units — even ones far too big or too small for their families — will refuse to move. The vacancy rate will get even tighter, and market rents will skyrocket. Developers will avoid building new housing, as Mamdani seeks to control what they can charge. But not even those living in rent-controlled apartments will escape the damage. Frozen rents will mean landlords are less likely to upgrade buildings, and do the bare minimum in terms of amenities and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;14. He’ll make schools worse.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his predecessors fighting for decades to get mayoral control of schools, Mamdani promises to just give it away — and let the teachers union dictate the way forward. That means no accountability. No grades or testing. No discipline. No moves to crack down on chronic absenteeism. Unaffordable contracts and pension sweeteners. And restrictions on charter schools, to prevent students from escaping from a failed system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;15. He’ll drive us deeper into debt.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reason Foundation found that New York City has total liabilities of $300 billion last year, four times that of Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Yet the City Council has refused any cuts to its $115 billion budget, or to increase a rainy day fund for fiscal downturns. Mamdani offers no idea on how to handle debt, only plans to spend even more money. We already spend 10.6% of our tax revenue to service interest on debt — what’s the limit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;16. And he’ll drive away the golden goose.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City politicians are able to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/business/why-wall-street-isnt-celebrating-after-zohran-mamdanis-thrashing-in-final-debate/"&gt;spend like drunken Democrats thanks to Wall Street.&lt;/a&gt; The top 1% of city taxpayers provided 48% of the city’s personal income tax revenue. Rather than say “thank you,” Mamdani wants to raise their taxes even more. Gov. Hochul has said she’s against tax hikes, but will she hold the line? Will Mamdani get Albany politicians to overrule them? And with higher taxes and unsafe streets, what’s to stop the rich from just leaving town? Houses in Connecticut are already going up, up, up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;17. He’d put federal assistance at risk.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal money helps New York hum. A Mayor Mamdani who spends his days bashing President Trump and pledging to oppose ICE may fire up the left-wing loonies, but it’s going to hurt the city with lost revenue for infrastructure projects, health care and education. Why make the city the biggest target?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18He will use New York as the launchpad for a state and national movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani would use his position as a Gracie Socialist to rally other socialists. He already refuses to endorse Hochul (despite the fact that she endorsed him) because he wants to see a socialist in the governor’s mansion. Senator AOC? Gov. Cynthia Nixon? Get ready for your taxpayer matching funds to help make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;19. He has no experience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 34-year-old was a rapper, worked as a foreclosure prevention counselor for a hot minute, then began volunteering for socialists. He ran successfully for state Assembly in 2019. In Albany, he introduced just 20 bills in four years and passed just three. As usual, his priorities were punishing non-profits that worked with Israel. This year, he missed one-third of the legislative session. In short, Mamdani has no real experience in governance, business, law, finance, running a large organization (or even a small one). But if you want to yell about how bad Israel is, he’s got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re not doing that anymore,” he said. “The program&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/28/how-new-yorkers-are-making-bank-ratting-out-idling-drivers/"&gt; has become an occupation&lt;/a&gt;. The program was not intended to be an occupation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple’s Citizen Idling Complaint Program was launched in 2019, with the city even recruiting ’80s punk rocker Billy Idol to promote the effort the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Billy never idles. Neither should you. Idling is polluting. Cut your engine off,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/27/billy-idol-is-helping-de-blasio-take-on-idling-cars-in-new-campaign/"&gt;the rock star urged&lt;/a&gt; in an ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the program, citizen enforcers are awarded 25% of the fines pursued by the Department of Environmental and substantiated by the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, or OATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Streeter of Brooklyn Heights earned over $700K while catching idling vehicles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CBS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tattletales go to OATH directly, they can receive 50 percent of any substantiated offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fines ranging from $350 to $2,000 for idling and 95% of the complaints substantiated, the rewards add up and have turned the streets into gold for the Big Apple’s citizen enforcers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DEP records obtained by The Post, here are the top-earning enviro-enforcers who have earned an “assumed” total amount of more than $500,000 and approaching $1 million:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ernest Welde of the East Village, Manhattan: $895,737&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanfang Wu of the Lower East Side, Manhattan: $748,825&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ephraim Rosenbaum of the Lower East Side: $725, 025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Streeter of Brooklyn Heights: $709, 975&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick Schnell of Boerum Hill, Brooklyn: $582,800&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program involves simply taking phone videos of trucks idling for more than 3 minutes or school buses for more than 1 minute and submitting the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/06/us-news/brazen-city-workers-illegally-park-vehicles-in-traffic-choked-nyc-neighborhood-survey-finds-its-time-we-take-action/"&gt; footage as evidence&lt;/a&gt; to the DEP and OATH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More New Yorkers appear to be catching on to the easy money, with the number of bounty-hunter submissions fielded by the DEP skyrocketing in recent years — increasing from 49,000 in 2022 to 124,000 in 2024. More than 100,000 have been filed this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But DEP officials said the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/06/nyc-will-pay-you-big-bucks-for-ratting-out-idling-trucks-buses/"&gt;anti-idling whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt; are focusing their attention on the city’s business core such as Midtown and lower Manhattan, wealthier Brooklyn neighborhoods and western Queens — not exactly the “environmental justice” communities” such as Harlem, the South Bronx, Brooklyn’s East New York and Brownsville and Staten Island’s North Shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department of Environmental Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala last year told the council, “While we can and should pay people who do the service of reporting offenses, we do not need to make them millionaires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the citizen enforcers, Schnell, insisted that he hasn’t collected the $582,000 in rewards that the DEP suggests he has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where did you get that number from?” a shocked Schnell told a Post reporter from behind a cracked door in front of the entrance of his Brooklyn home Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is not the money I have received,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before closing the door, Schnell added,  “It’s hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rep for an anti-idling activist group responded on behalf of other top complaint filers contacted by The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution is deadly—it causes cancer, dementia, asthma, and 3,200 premature deaths in New York each year—so it’s no surprise that the truck and bus industries and their allies want to change the subject,” George Pakenham of the New York Clean Air Collective said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Department of Environmental Protection should let more people report illegal air pollution by fixing its ancient website, ending its discrimination against non-English-speaking New Yorkers, and hiring more workers to hold polluters accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A depraved sicko &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/schoolgirls-decades-long-cold-case-murder-solved-with-dna-confession-evidence/"&gt;repeatedly raped &lt;/a&gt;his 12-year-old daughter after she moved into his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/this-rap-group-put-strong-island-on-the-hip-hop-map-broke-through-nyc-barrier/"&gt;Long Island home&lt;/a&gt;, a Suffolk County jury has found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unnamed man, 48, from Wyandanch was found guilty Thursday of the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/nj-probe-could-uncover-details-of-clergy-abuse-at-delbarton-school/"&gt; horrific acts&lt;/a&gt;, which began when the child was 12 and continued until she was 14 — when she emotionally confided in a friend and teacher at her school on what was taking place at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in a press release that the child’s nightmare began after her father gained custody of her from an out-of-state relative, who was her guardian at the time and no longer in a condition to care for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father started &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/us-news/girls-groomed-online-as-teens-reveal-shocking-tactics-used/"&gt;grooming and sexually abusing&lt;/a&gt; the child, framing his depraved actions as “doing something to help her,” according to the DA — who said the abuse then escalated to disturbingly unimaginable levels before she turned to those she trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This 12-year-old victim was&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/26/world-news/lola-daviets-father-died-of-grief-after-she-was-raped-beheaded-by-migrant-in-france/"&gt; betrayed and violated&lt;/a&gt; by the very person who was supposed to protect her – her father,” Tierney said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The victim will have to live with the scars of this for the rest of her life, but I am thankful we were able to hold her father accountable for the unimaginable abuse that he inflicted upon her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twisted dad, whose name was not released to protect the identity of his abused child, was found guilty of of multiple counts of rape and other violent sexual crimes against a minor, as well as endangering the welfare of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He faces up to 50 years in prison and is due back in court Dec. 3 for sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former leader of the UK’s Labour Party&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/29/jeremy-corbyn-former-uk-opposition-leader-suspended-over-anti-semitism-claims/"&gt; who faced allegations of antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; is working the phones on Sunday for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a Democratic Socialists of America fundraiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn, who was ousted from his party in 2020 following reports criticizing his handling of antisemitism complaints, touted his role hosting the phone bank event with the DSA’s NYC branch, urging New Yorkers to support the democratic socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get Zohran over the finish line for a New York that’s affordable for all!” the controversial Brit wrote on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbyn’s involvement in the event quickly garnered backlash given his allegations of antisemitism, which rocked the UK opposition party after a government watchdog claimed Corbyn’s office broke equality laws through its “inexcusable” handling of the complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current party leader and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it “a day of shame for the Labour Party,” which voted to suspend Corbyn, who denied the allegations and now stands as an independent in parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His appearance at the fundraiser led to Mamdani’s opponents condemning it as yet another example of the front-runner’s own alleged antisemitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having Jeremy Corbyn – someone whose party was found to have committed unlawful acts of discrimination against Jewish people under his leadership – phone-banking for @ZohranKMamdani says everything you need to know,” former Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote on X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NY doesn’t need politics of moral compromise. We need leadership that rejects antisemitism, extremism, and division in every form and in every corner,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuomo currently stands as the second favorite to win as he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/us-news/zohran-mamdani-accuses-cuomo-other-opponents-of-islamophobia-after-being-branded-antisemitic-over-anti-israel-views/"&gt;ramps up his attacks on Mamdani&lt;/a&gt;, who beat him in the Democratic primary earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani has repeatedly faced &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/us-news/zohran-mamdani-would-dismantle-nycs-definition-of-antisemitism-approved-by-holocaust-remembrance-group/"&gt;allegations of being antisemitic&lt;/a&gt; over his vocal advocacy against Israel and the war in Gaza, with many New York Jewish leaders fearing his possible win on election night could threaten to encourage antisemitism in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rap pioneers JVC Force put the suburbs on the hip-hop map with the iconic anthem “Strong Island” in the late 1980s — and their funk-filled ode to Long Island has new life stretching all the way across the pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rok and partner B-Luv recently reunited — nearly 37 years after “Strong Island” was released — and embarked on a fall mini-tour in Europe where fans are clamoring for old-school hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Love has never ceased overseas. I probably do six [foreign] interviews a year,” Rok said before boarding a flight to a recent JVC &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/09/us-news/ntsb-describes-scary-turbulence-on-delta-flight-that-left-18-people-hospitalized/"&gt;show in Amsterdam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strong Island” meaningfully changed things closer to home, however, as the group helped differentiate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/long-island-kayakers-vanish-after-sending-selfie-to-gal-pal/"&gt;Long Island &lt;/a&gt;from the city in a hallmark first for the Bronx-born genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People didn’t really know there were rappers from Long Island at the time,” said Rok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beating the boroughs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city scene hadn’t played nice with outsiders from the early 1980s on, according to Archie Snowden, a hip hop influence of the time who’s now producing a documentary on LI rap history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The guys in the city, they went out of their way to block [Long Island artists] out,” Snowden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of those guys weren’t even saying they were from Long Island. They were saying they were from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/teen-executed-in-grim-nyc-street-shooting-killer-still-on-the-loose/"&gt;Brooklyn and Queens; &lt;/a&gt;otherwise, they weren’t going to get any recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakim was one of the first to boldly divide the two when the Wyandanch-born artist rapped that he was “rough enough to break New York from Long Island” in the 1986 track “My Melody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College radio was the place to be back in the day, as future game changers like Hempstead’s Busta Rhymes and his group Leaders of the New School used to take calls from the studios, according to Rok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowden said “Strong Island” was the catalyst that “started to wake folks up in the music industry” to the vast talents waiting for their moment just a few miles beyond the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be one for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turnout for the Big Apple mayoral race is hitting historic highs, with nearly 2 million voters expected to cast their ballots &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/andrew-cuomo-closing-in-on-zohran-mamdani-as-nyc-mayoral-race-tightens/"&gt;by the end of Election Day&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, leading pollsters tell The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dizzying numbers, already the highest in the five boroughs in decades, could see more moderates heading to the polls — which could spell trouble for lefty Democrat Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner, as he tries to fend off a recent surge &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/queens-democrat-party-snubs-own-assemblyman-zohran-mamdani-refuses-to-endorse-him-for-nyc-mayor/"&gt;by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, the experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts say the turnout for the New York City mayoral race this year could near 2 million for the first time since 1969. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nigro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s driving it is we have the most interesting, hotly contested general election for mayor since 2001,” said Evan Roth Smith, a pollster with Slingshot Strategies. “And New Yorkers turn out when there’s actually something to vote about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 1.9 million voters are expected to vote in the race, topping the 1.5 million who voted when Republican Michael Bloomberg defeated Mark Green in 2021, and believed to be the highest Big Apple turnout since nearly 2.5 million headed to the polls in 1969 to elect liberal John Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year could come close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani stunned the city with a Democratic primary win in the mayoral race. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are really going to end with another 100,000 today,”  Stephen Graves of Gotham Polling said Sunday. “You have to figure we are gong to have at least 700,000 votes, and that would push the turnout to 1.8 or 1.9 million, 1.94 million. That is going to be over the 2022 vote in the congressional election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By the numbers, it’s surprising,” Graves said. “It’s going to be between a congressional election and a presidential election. This one, being near 2 million, is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said while a boost in younger voters is expected to help Mamdani, a socialist Muslim, the higher turnout could help Cuomo, a traditional Democrat running on an independent line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the turnout gets larger, it leans more moderate and brings in the independents,” Graves said. “That benefits Cuomo because he was getting more independent while the vast majority of Mamdani’s voters were Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pollsters said the monster voter turnout for the mayoral race proves that New Yorkers show up when the race matters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nigro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But Mamdani can absolutely win with just Democrats,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it’s unlikely that Mamdani will get a majority of all the votes in the three-way race, “so it’s about how that gets split up between Cuomo and Sliwa.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s surprise primary win over Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams rattled political circles, with Republicans and traditional Democrats worried about the Queens state assemblyman’s socialist views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams dropped out of the race, as Cuomo gained more backers as the best chance to block Mamdani — and both Cuomo and Sliwa resisted calls to drop out of the race to increase the odds of beating him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has boosted interest in the race, with new registrations peaking at nearly 17,000 a day between January and June compared to just 2,000 in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.nycvotes.org/news-and-press/articles/2025-primary-election-turnout-soars/"&gt;according to nycvotes.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 92-year-old Holocaust survivor in The Bronx recently voted for the first time ever — saying she cast a ballot for mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo to try to stop &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/andrew-cuomo-closing-in-on-zohran-mamdani-as-nyc-mayoral-race-tightens/"&gt;front-runner Zohran Mamdani.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never voted before. I’m voting because I believe that Mamdani is an antisemite with dangerous fiscal policies,” Galina Guterman told The Post, speaking through a Russian interpreter after voting at the Riverdale YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t trust him,” Guterman said of Democratic Socialist Mamdani. “He has not proven to be the person that cares about everyone and cares about me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guterman accused Mamdani of being an “antisemite with dangerous fiscal policies.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I listen to what [Mamdani] says about ‘globalize the intifada’, that is not kind-hearted,” Guterman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/us-news/nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-leads-bds-chant-bashes-officials-for-traveling-to-israel-in-resurfaced-clip/"&gt;supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel &lt;/a&gt;and said he backs the arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has said he’s not an antisemite for promoting Palestinian rights and opposing the “genocide” in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic-front runner also said he now discourages the phrase “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/16/us-news/zohran-mamdani-slammed-over-refusal-to-condemn-hamas-and-globalize-the-intifada-phrase/"&gt;globalize the intifada&lt;/a&gt;,” a rallying cry that many believe is a call to commit violence and kill Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Guterman said Mamdani is too much of a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cuomo is just what the city needs,” she said. “Cuomo is trustworthy, real and honest, Cuomo is someone I trust. He is a good person, and he’s honest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queens Democratic Party leadership has snubbed one of its own — refusing to endorse Dem city mayoral nominee and borough &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/andrew-cuomo-closing-in-on-zohran-mamdani-as-nyc-mayoral-race-tightens/"&gt;Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani&lt;/a&gt; before Tuesday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of Democrats in Queens who do not support Mamdani,” Democratic district leader Hiram Monserrate told The Post of the local party chapter, which held its annual pre-election gala at Antun’s restaurant last week — and mayoral contender Andrew Cuomo’s campaign literature was instead seen at many of the tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a reckoning occurring in the Democratic Party. There is a growing concern that socialism is hijacking the Democratic Party,” Monserrate said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Queens Democratic Party has declined to endorse Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for mayor. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Queens party had endorsed Cuomo during the Democratic mayoral primary in June, but Mamdani trounced the Queens native, forcing the ex-gov to run in the general election on an independent line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Gregory Meeks, the party chairman, and the Queens organization have since declined to endorse Mamdani, the front-runner and nominee who lives in Astoria, in the general race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand it. It’s disgraceful,” a party insider said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Monserrate said Meeks would have faced pushback if he recommended a Mamdani endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani does have backing from some of the borough’s major political figures, including &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/zohran-mamdani-endorsed-by-queen-borough-president-who-compares-socialist-to-obama/"&gt;Queens Borough President Donovan Richards &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/02/us-news/zohran-mamdani-nabs-key-endorsement-in-nyc-mayoral-race-despite-big-disagreement-on-israel/"&gt;state Sen.

&lt;p&gt;Other elected officials and district leaders are quietly backing Cuomo or staying mum, and so the party organization sat out the race, party sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeks personally never endorsed Mamdani and is more interested in Queens’ role to help elect the new City Council speaker, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated 55,000 runners from all over the world showed up bright and early this morning with numbered bibs secured to their chests and running sneakers laced to run the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/new-york-city-marathon-2025-results-who-were-the-winners/"&gt;TCS New York City Marathon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many wore the expected sporty tank top and shorts ensemble to complete the impressive 26.2 mile-race, others wanted to make sure they stood out to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/31/lifestyle/crazy-nyc-marathon-fanatics-are-as-rabid-as-the-runners-but-at-least-they-have-mimosas-and-bagels/"&gt;2 million spectators &lt;/a&gt;hootin’ and hollerin’, cheering them on behind police barricades throughout the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in NYC will you find people painted green to represent the Statue of Libery or wearing a crown of soon-to-be extinct metro cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the wildest, wackiest and most spirited outfits spotted running the NYC Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former President Barack Obama talked with mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani by phone Saturday but withheld endorsing him — after publicly backing even widely ridiculed Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic ex-prez was just across the Hudson River at a last-minute rally for New Jersey Dem gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill at Essex County Community College in Newark on Saturday, but he didn’t venture into New York City to lobby for the party’s mayoral hopeful in person — much less throw his public support behind him before Tuesday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani campaign adviser Patrick Gaspard, who served as director of White House Office of Political Affairs and US Ambassador to South Africa under Obama, futilely tried to downplay the former president’s lack of endorsement as one of the race’s latest polls showed Mamdani foe Andrew Cuomo closing in.&lt;/p&gt;

style="aspect-ratio:1.49926794;display:block" width="885"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former President Barack Obama joins a long list of mainstream Democrats who have not publicly thrown their support behind lefty Zohran Mamdani’s bid for New York City mayor. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Obama doesn’t endorse in local races. That’s a longstanding rule post-presidency,” Gaspard claimed to The Post. “He endorses in general election races for federal office and governors. His call to Zohran is a huge boost at a critical moment and a signal to New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Obama’s so-called endorsement “rule” is apparently plenty bendable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the 44th president has endorsed numerous candidates for mayor over the years, including the unpopular de Blasio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other mayoral candidates endorsed by Obama also included beleaguered Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, as well as her predecessor Eric Garcetti, and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who later served as Obama’s White House Chief of Staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former prez has even waded into mayoral contests in smaller cities, endorsing Rick Kriseman for mayor of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Caroline Simmons for mayor of Stanford, Conn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani spokeswoman Dora Pekec meanwhile tried to equally explain away the non-endorsement in a statement to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city,” Pekec said of the pair’s phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far-left politicians such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been on the campaign trail with Mamdani, but mainstream Dems including Obama have conspicuously avoided throwing their support behind the radical Democratic Socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) have declined to endorse anyone in the contentious mayor’s race, and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only publicly backed Mamdani on Oct. 24, a day before early voting in the city began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, a moderate Democrat, even &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/us-news/congressman-and-ex-eric-adams-ally-backs-andrew-cuomo-for-nyc-mayor-dont-want-the-socialists-to-win/"&gt;announced he was backing former Gov. Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; — a Dem who is now running as an independent after Mamdani’s stunning primary victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo,” Suozzi said in a social-media post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi said of Mamdani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 34-year-old Mamdani’s lack of executive experience, he once backed the controversial “Defund the Police” movement and has pledged to raise taxes on businesses and wealthy New Yorkers to help fund his socialist agenda, which includes city-run grocery stores and free buses, the latter of which &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/12/us-news/washington-post-roasts-mamdanis-free-bus-plan/"&gt;critics have warned&lt;/a&gt; would be magnets for drug users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani still leads Cuomo by 6.6 percentage points with 72 hours to go until Election Day, but it represents the slimmest edge he’s had since July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new AtlasIntel poll released Saturday, Mamdani is in the lead with 40.6%, compared to 34% for Cuomo and 24.1% for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate currently has Mamdani ahead by an average of 14.5%, leaving him well-positioned to be named the Big Apple’s next mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/us-news/hellen-obiri-of-kenya-sets-record-and-wins-the-2025-nyc-marathon/"&gt;New York City Marathon&lt;/a&gt; has been a wild success for the Big Apple’s largest charter-school network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50 educators and other employees at Success Academy are running in the marathon — including founder and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/31/opinion/if-success-academy-kids-can-run-education-marathon-i-can-run-nyc-marathon/"&gt;CEO Eva Moskowitz &lt;/a&gt;— an effort that will raise up to $1 million from pledges to support its programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter network’s runners even trained together for the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="block-95965002-895b-43e8-9219-5f3c248fd42a"&gt;More than 50 educators and other employees at Success Academy are running in the marathon — including founder and CEO Eva Moskowitz — an effort that will raise up to $1 million from pledges to support its programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="block-30dd163c-49dd-4a1f-9745-1859343c1aa1"&gt;The charter network’s runners even trained together for the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="block-1af0d973-d6ca-4ebf-94ad-35bab88e64cf"&gt;“Education is an endurance sport,” Moskowitz said before the grueling 26.2 miles trek through the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="block-375494e5-bd0d-4f80-adc1-70fab7e76e94"&gt;Moskowitz, 61, first ran in the city’s marathon last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Saturday Night Live” ripped Zohran Mamdani for making empty promises — and mocked his appeals to white guilt in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/entertainment/snl-cold-open-mocks-nyc-mayoral-election-2025-race-between-mamdani-cuomo-sliwa/"&gt;blistering parody of the New York mayor’s race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocking the socialist Dem’s constant vacant smile, comedian Ramy Youssef rattled off a list of Mamdani pledges during his portrayal of the frontrunner on Saturday’s NBC show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by debate chair &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/08/entertainment/snl-season-51-finalizes-cast-who-is-returning/"&gt;Kenan Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, “Why would you want the worst job in the world?” Youssef’s Mamdani claimed he wanted to offer a “better New York,” before admitting his ideas were unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey girl,” he said. “I know you got, uh, got a little white guilt for gentrifying that Spanish neighborhood, don’t you? Why don’t you vote for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, you feel a little less bad about that chicken and rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen,” he added. “So why don’t you hit me up at the ballot box, girl?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polling data shows Mamdani received the greatest support in the Democratic primary in Ridgewood, Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, three neighborhoods synonymous with gentrification in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And here we have the front-runner, Zohran Mamdani,” he said. “Looks like the SubwayTakes guy went to work at McKinsey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, you feel a little less bad about that chicken and rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen. So why don’t you hit me up at the ballot box, girl?” he added, prompting a mock rebuke from chair Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr Mamdani, you were warned that this is not the forum for your TikTokry,” he said, referencing the 34-year-old’s social media presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Queens principal who counts former Jay-Z manager Damon Dash and his wife as close pals turned her school into a slush fund for friends, whistleblowers charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aneesha Jacko of PS 35 Nathaniel Woodhull in Hollis has spent tens of thousands in taxpayer funds to buy books published by pals, hired others as consultants, and boldly touted their brands on a sprawling lobby mural that is practically a billboard, staffers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It absolutely blows my mind that she is still allowed to run our school,” a faculty member said of the principal, who took PS 35’s helm in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS 35 Principal Aneesha Jacko, at left, is under scrutiny for purchases with school funds, including $10,000 for clothing from music mogul Damon Dash’s company, Poppington, and hundreds of books by his wife, Raquel Horn. . &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools has been probing complaints about Jacko’s spending for more than three years, spokesman Jason Brooks confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The case is still open, and therefore the SCI cannot comment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials have not accused Jacko of any criminal wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCI issued a report in 2022, faulting Jacko for granting excess overtime to a teacher she favored, costing $10,500 in improper payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent agency referred three other complaints to the city Department of Education to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

Whistleblowers complained to the pecial Commissioner of Investigation.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko’s closest associates include Dash, who is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;’s ex-business partner and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc-A-Fella_Records" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roc-A-Fella Records&lt;/a&gt;, and Dash’s wife Raquel Horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash, a controversial figure who overcame drug dealing in his youth, recently&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/18/us-news/damon-dash-declared-bankruptcy-to-avoid-5-million-in-claims/"&gt; filed for bankruptcy t&lt;/a&gt;o avoid $5 million in lawsuit debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He currently owes New York $2.1 million in back taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacko used school funds to buy some 500 copies, which retail for $14.95 each in paperback, according to insiders familiar with the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the school bought similar boxloads of Horn’s first book, &lt;a href="https://lightswitchlearning.com/product/dusko-goes-to-space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Dusko Goes to Space.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total cost could not be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash defended the purchases and blasted the SCI probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a budget for them to buy books. So why is it a problem?” he asked The Post, saying PS 35 “tested” the books first and found them beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a racist thing that she’s even being looked at and scrutinized,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just because she’s a black woman that has good reading scores for her kids and gets more for her money. She’s trying to help these kids learn how to read.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Principal Aneesha Jacko had murals painted throughout the PS 35 lobby displaying the titles or words from friends’ books that she bought by the hundreds, sparking an ongoing probe of her spending practices. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On state reading exams last year, 40% of PS 35 students in grades 3 to 5 tested proficient, below the 47% citywide average&lt;a href="https://insideschools.org/school/29Q035"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://tools.nycenet.edu/snapshot/2024/29Q035/EMS/#IP" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the DOE reports.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jacko’s Instagram account, the principal cites a “paid partnership” with Poppington Clothing &amp;amp; Dame Dash Studios, the embattled mogul’s apparel line and music company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash said the studio dissolved several years ago, and no partnership exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko used school funds to pay Poppington LLC $10,000 on March 9, 2022, according to school records reviewed by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase was for t-shirts, Dash said, adding that he sold the clothes to Jacko at cost “so she could get more for her money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacko’s Instagram photos show the principal with Dash and Horn in social settings, including a birthday celebration at their home in Queens with the hash tag “family” in the caption, and a visit to a Legoland theme park with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course, once you start doing business with somebody, you get to know them,” Dash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So we know her, but the only way we know her is from her educating us and telling us how to help her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash said he met Jacko through education consultant Dennis McKesey, founder and CEO of In Our Best Interest, and Off School Grounds, companies working with principals to reform urban education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School records show $49,100 in payments to In Our Best Interest LLC. in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staffers say Jacko hired McKesey at least two years in a row before the SCI probe began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody knew what the hell he did for us,” a teacher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were no visible signs that this man was helping our school in any way. He was hardly ever there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--nypostbusinessunit aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Morning Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko’s Instagram page features many photos and videos suggesting a friendship with McKesey along with Dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSG website – currently down – promoted Jacko’s book, “&lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B0BLGG7MB3" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudacity-Speak-Finding-Power-Authentic%2Fdp%2FB0BLGG7MB3%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fdib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tfyewQyooHGZdL8kshB7gg.Wod5g3A-0SX8826ZY3wZbnsiHaK0l60eMBn3bgqEe_U%26dib_tag%3Dse%26hvadid%3D654277995591%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvexpln%3D0%26hvlocphy%3D9003653%26hvnetw%3Ds%26hvocijid%3D5522917815248912764--%26hvqmt%3De%26hvrand%3D5522917815248912764%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-2007775045121%26hydadcr%3D17334_13418841%26keywords%3Daneesha%20jacko%26mcid%3Dafcc52d6555f310c9987581d3486cd53%26qid%3D1761788535%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F11%2F02%2Fus-news%2Fnyc-principal-under-probe-showered-taxpayer-funds-on-pals-including-jay-zs-bankrupt-ex-manager-and-wife%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audacity to Speak: Finding the Power to Be Your Most Authentic Self,” &lt;/a&gt;which she self-published in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKesey declined to comment on his role at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko also favored A. McClarty, a fellow member of Delta Sigma Theta, an African-American service sorority, tapping the school budget to buy about 100 copies of her book “&lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="0990819825" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FReaching-Stars-Connecting-Celebrities-Building%2Fdp%2F0990819825%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F11%2F02%2Fus-news%2Fnyc-principal-under-probe-showered-taxpayer-funds-on-pals-including-jay-zs-bankrupt-ex-manager-and-wife%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaching for the Stars: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10 Secret Steps to Connecting with Celebrities and Building Your Brand” for all PS 35 fourth graders, insiders say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book encourages students — no specific age recommended — to reach out to celebs and learn about their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko paid McClarty’s non-profit, Young Faces Smiling, $26,877 in 2022, school records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other purchases, records show, include a jaw-dropping 1,285 books by Jacko’s friend Brianna Greenspan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One purchase order lists 435 copies of “Everything is Right About You” with three different subtitles; 200 copies of “I Am the Best Me;” 630 copies of “The Miracle Morning Art of Affirmations,” which is a $20 coloring book; and 35 copies in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacko used school funds to pay Sussman Education Inc., which publishes those books, $61,000 in early 2022, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She hardly buys any other books for children to read,” a teacher said of the massive purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram photos show Jacko and Greenspan as chums –in one, smiling side-by-side in a hair salon captioned “Sunday Funday in Queens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DOE procurement rules, employees who spend taxpayer dollars “shall encourage competition, prevent fraud, favoritism, and corruption, and obtain the best value in the interest of the DOE and the taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irking insiders, Jacko had a vast mural painted in the school lobby which displays the titles or words from books by Greenspan, McClarty, another friend Amen Rahh’s “Revolutionary,” the letters OSG, Horn’s ”Dusko” and the logo of Horn’s YouTube channel, “Apple Fish Kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is free advertisement for your friends with taxpayer dollars,” a staffer complained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS 35 staffers who spoke to The Post requested anonymity because they fear retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOE spokeswoman Nicole Brownstein refused to answer any questions about Jacko. The principal did not reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
