&lt;p&gt;Selfie-obsessed tourists have&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/nyc-neighborhood-is-the-first-with-turkey-crossing-signs-as-residents-hope-to-protect-rare-wild-bird-rosie/"&gt; taken over the Roosevelt Island&lt;/a&gt; tram — creating a massive headache for locals who are being forced to wait in lines stacked with as many as 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tram between Manhattan and the smaller iconic island has long been a tourist destination, but it took off in popularity this summer when it was blasted on various “top attractions in New York City” lists and across social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A long line wraps around Tramway Plaza in Manhattan on Monday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is insane. … In all my time on the Island, I have never seen something like this,” said a Roosevelt resident named Ashley, who declined to give her last name, to The Post on Sunday morning — as several hundred people were lined up&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/us-news/red-bus-chaos-on-nycs-roosevelt-island-locals-decry-the-bus-services-summer-struggles/"&gt; at Tramway Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan waiting to board the tram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived on Roosevelt Island for a little over eight years, and I’m disgusted every time I get off the tram, knowing I have to wait in that ridiculous line to get back,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-run &lt;a href="https://www.nyctourism.com/new-york/manhattan/roosevelt-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYC Tourism+Conventions group encourages tourists &lt;/a&gt;to ride the skylift to witness “a unique perspective on the City,” only apparently adding to its allure. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a beautiful way to get pictures of New York,” said Amelia Singh, 29, who is visiting from Guyana, as she was waiting for a return ride back to Manhattan over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The tram can fit 109 riders and rolls through every 10 minutes during rush hour. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I saw it on TikTok and made sure it was on my list of things to do,” she said of the tram. “Also, today was perfect weather to do it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked if she actually spent any time on Roosevelt Island, Singh responded, “Briefly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We walked around and took pictures where you can see the bridge and the water. Then we came back over.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A family visiting from Argentina, who declined to share their names, said they added the tram to their itinerary after spotting it on a “list of attractions to do in New York” and hearing about it from friends who had previously made trips to the Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were told it would be a fun way to see the New York skyline,” one of the relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourism for the tram has boomed in recent months, much to the disappointment of locals. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family tried to leave their strollers on the tram platform but were promptly told not to by the conductor — making for just one of several slowdowns Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only one tram was in operation for the busy afternoon. On at least three occasions, the crowds swarmed the car so that it was over its 109-person capacity — forcing the conductor to remove up to several people each time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform was also visibly unsafely packed, with crowds standing shoulder to shoulder and lines bleeding through emergency exits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chaos is the new normal, according to residents — who are demanding that the Roosevelt Island Operating Corp. implement a new priority boarding policy that would allow locals and workers to skip the lengthy lines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The platform was so packed Sunday that the crowds were being pushed into the emergency exits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RIOC last year rejected such a proposal, saying in a statement that it would violate state law and contracts it has made with the city and the MTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“RIOC is … tasked with operating and maintaining Roosevelt Island, yes for residents, but also for all New Yorkers and any visitors alike,” &lt;a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=392" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the statement said. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“RIOC is proud of the iconic Roosevelt Island Tram, and we are proud that it is open equally to all New Yorkers and to the millions of people who visit New York City every year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But locals have continued their crusade, launching &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/priority-boarding-for-residents-and-workers-on-the-roosevelt-island-tram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; in November that has racked up more than 2,300 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents are calling for a priority boarding line so they can skip the lengthy waits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Make a line for residents and workers and another line for tourists,” said Roosevelt resident Nathan Lewis, 37. “That way everybody is happy. The people trying to just go home and get home peacefully and the people that want to take pictures, can take pictures in peace,” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he himself has given up on the tram, even though he and many other islanders consider it a safer option compared to taking the F subway line back and forth to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I stopped taking the subway when I heard about the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;random pushing and stabbings.&lt;/a&gt; I looked forward to my peaceful ride on the tram. But nope, not anymore. I have to go back to taking the subway, or It would take me over an hour to go home some days,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I understand the view is nice, but then maybe residents should have a priority line,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another resident gave up on the tram Sunday after waiting in line for 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourist Amelia Singh said the tram is “a beautiful way to get pictures of New York.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to miss my appointment waiting on this line,” the woman said. “This is horrible. … They have one car running, and it’s coming every 10 to 15 minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6263/Performance-Measure-Report-FY2223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to an RIOC report&lt;/a&gt;, the tram serves more than 2 million people annually — a staggering figure that locals claim has only skyrocketed further in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RIOC could not provide figures for 2024, but a spokesperson pointed out that the F train, NYC Ferry and Q102 bus using the bridge linking Manhattan with Roosevelt are available and have typically shorter wait times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tram runs every 10 minutes during rush hour but an infuriating 21 minutes at other times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The agency overseeing the tram said it would be illegal to give residents and workers priority boarding. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many seething Roosevelt Islanders have joined Lewis in switching to the subway in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in addition to safety concerns, the F train is not a very reliable mode of transportation, they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I take the F train, but there was a period where the F train didn’t work — repairs on the track,” said a longtime island resident and retired doctor, who only gave her initials, GS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to describe the increase in tourism, she said, “Horrible, horrible!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many residents have abandoned the tram and have since turned to the subway, which they say has its own issues. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived on the island for 40 years, and it was never like this,” GS said, adding that while she hopes the RIOC will implement a resident priority lane, it’s likely a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s just lately, when the corporation wants to make more money or sales — they don’t care about the residents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Toustis] don’t even come to see the island. They just cross the river and then come back. Something should happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman swore in 26 citizens as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/10/us-news/nassau-county-exec-bruce-blakeman-plans-to-deputize-private-citizens-during-emergencies/"&gt;new “special deputies” &lt;/a&gt;who will be activated to assist the county during emergencies, such as a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The provisional special deputies — many of them retired police officers, and military and emergency responders — are licensed to carry guns and receive firearms training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to thank you for stepping up to the plate and being part of our safety and security in Nassau County,”&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/24/us-news/nassau-county-executive-bruce-blakeman-swamped-with-support-for-trans-athlete-ban/"&gt; Blakeman said &lt;/a&gt;at the graduation ceremony Monday night in Mineola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The number one job of a public official is public safety, public health, and public welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics have slammed the program, which falls under the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office, as Blakeman’s private militia.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;But he brushed off the brickbats, saying the special deputies will supplement — not supplant — police and emergency responders, such as by providing coverage at power plants, hospitals, and faith-based institutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their activation will help police and emergency responders do their jobs, the county executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deputies don’t get paid unless they’re activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of the newborn baby girl left abandoned in a tote bag outside a Bronx building over the weekend now faces criminal charges, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delfina Galvez, 26, turned herself in late Monday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/nypd-releases-photo-of-mystery-person-in-scramble-to-solve-case-of-abandoned-baby-girl-stuffed-in-tote-bag/"&gt;after the NYPD released surveillance footage &lt;/a&gt;showing the suspect believed to have dumped the infant on a rain-drenched sidewalk outside a Morrisania building early Sunday, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez was charged with reckless endangerment, acting in a manner injurious to a child and abandonment of a child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Delfina Galvez allegedly abandoned her infant daughter in a tote bag in front of a Bronx apartment building, authorities said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her tiny daughter, who appears to be only a few days old, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/cops-find-newborn-girl-in-tote-bag-dumped-outside-in-nyc/"&gt;was left alone outside the building &lt;/a&gt;on Reverend James Polite Ave. near East 167th Street around 6 a.m., swaddled in blankets inside the tote bag, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby’s cries prompted someone to call 911, law enforcement sources said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cops spoke to the caller and then found the infant inside the dumped bag, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Galvez was charged with reckless endangerment, acting in a manner injurious to a child and abandonment of a child, cops said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The few days-old infant was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in stable condition. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EMS workers brought the baby to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was listed in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez surrendered several hours after the NYPD released video allegedly showing her carrying the bag as she walked slowly along the sidewalk with a hood pulled up over her head, wearing a black face mask and glasses or sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez, who lives about a block from the spot where she is accused of dumping her newborn daughter, does not appear to have any prior arrests in the Big Apple, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to bundle up, Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/polar-vortex-headed-for-united-states-will-bring-exceptionally-cold-temps-in-the-new-year-weather-models-are-screaming/"&gt;polar vortex moving across the eastern half of the United States&lt;/a&gt; is set to bring shockingly cold temps to New York City — along with a potential snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting high temperatures in the New York City area to be falling as we get into the start of 2025,” Fox Forecast Center meteorologist Christopher Tate told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By the time we get into next week, we may not be escaping the 30s,” Tate said, later adding, “It’s going to be chilly, for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A polar vortex moving across the eastern half of the country will bring shockingly low temps to New York City.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s still too early to tell exactly what the polar vortex has in store for New York City, there is potential for a storm to develop in the first half of next week.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Any storm track that changes, even just 50 miles to the north of the South, will have a significant impact on whether we get snow, ice or rain in the metro. It’s a very fine line that we have to walk to get a bona fide snowstorm here in New York City,” Tate said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current projections suggest the polar vortex will last at least through the first week of January, with temperatures evening out by the second week of the month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A polar vortex is set to bring frigid temps to NYC.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forecasters say there’s a potential for a snowstorm to develop during the first week of January.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Climate Prediction Center at NOAA is still forecasting a likelier chance of below-average temperatures for pretty much everybody east of the Mississippi through mid-January,” Tate said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on long-range data, January has the potential to be the coldest across the US since 2014, forecasters told The Post on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are expected to begin dropping from the Rocky Mountains to the East Coast around Thursday, but the real plunge will set in sometime between seven and 14 days from now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system will bring wind chills across the Midwest dipping below zero and temperatures down to 20 degrees below average in some places, and freezing conditions setting in as far south as the Gulf Coast and even into Florida — though it is still too early to forecast exact temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most polar vortexes are unpredictable, this upcoming system will likely push persistent cold air into the region through January, with relief finally coming in February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passers-by are seen dashing down White Plains Road when the shots rang out at G&amp;amp;W Grocery around 4:50 p.m., the video footage obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police said at a Monday night briefing that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/six-shot-including-12-year-old-girl-in-bronx-as-cops-search-for-suspect-nypd/"&gt;gunmen chased two men into the bodega&lt;/a&gt; and opened fire — with the cowardly targets grabbing the 40-year-old mom and using her as a shield as shots rang out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mother was shot in the stomach, while her 12-year-old daughter was hit in the right thigh, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you can imagine, mom and daughter up against the counter, and the two intended targets come in and bump into them and turn the mother around as they are being shot at,” NYPD Chief of Department John Chell said at the briefing. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The chief called the shooting “heartless” and said cops are trying to determine a motive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other people — all men ranging in age from 18 to 21 — were also hit, suffering various injuries in the legs, arms and buttocks. The victims were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After the shots, people started running,” said a witness named Adama, who works at a local grocery down the block. “I had three customers in here, and they ran. One customer got his food, and then he ran. The other two customers, the didn’t wait. They were scared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police said the intended targets were two men who ran into the bodega and used a 40-year-old mom as a human shield.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were wounded, including a mom and her 12-year-old daughter. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you ear something like that — boom, boom — usually it’s shooting,” said Adama, 29. “I stood there. I didn’t go outside. It’s not safe.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surveillance video shows one man running from the scene, moments before two other people are seen fleeing down the block as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said the suspects remain at large while the investigation continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new lawsuit accuses former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration of stripping citizens of their  “basic liberties” and playing favorites when doling out exemptions to restrictive vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 168-page suit, filed earlier this month by a group of City Council members, questions why the 2020 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/george-floyd-protests-okay-amid-coronavirus-gathering-ban-de-blasio/"&gt;George Floyd protests &lt;/a&gt;were allowed to surge for months in the Big Apple, even as small businesses, religious institutions and schools were shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NYC residents were lied to about the effectiveness of the lockdown and the vaccine stopping the spread,”  the filing in Queens Supreme Court claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio and his administration are being accused of stripping NYC citizens of their “basic liberties” and playing favorites when doling out exemptions to restrictive COVID mandates during the pandemic, per court docs. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Messerschmidt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The suit notes that while hundreds of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/19/dozens-of-city-workers-file-250m-suit-seeking-to-end-vax-mandate/"&gt;city workers lost their jobs&lt;/a&gt; for not complying with vaccine mandates, Dr. Jay Varma, then the COVID czar, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/us-news/nyc-covid-adviser-brags-in-secret-recording-about-drug-fueled-sex-parties-mid-pandemic-had-to-be-sneaky/"&gt;was caught on camera earlier this year &lt;/a&gt;confessing to having drug-fueled sex parties mid-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition was filed Dec. 10 by council members Joanna Ariola (R-Queens), Kristy Marmorato (R-Bronx), Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn), Vickie Paladino (R-Queens), David Carr (R-Staten Island) and Robert Holden (D-Queens).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It lays out a series of seemingly contradictory decisions made by the city in the months after the Big Apple’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For instance, thousands of non-vaccinated emergency responders were “forced to work” without being properly informed about the virus or given the proper protective gear as protests over the police-involved death of Floyd surged in May and June 2020, the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But months later, when vaccines became available, many of those who refused to get the jab lost their jobs, the filing states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The respondents have never explained why the protests were permitted to go forward, but everything else used in daily living was shut down,” the suit argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suit points to the hypocrisy of Dr. Jay Varma, the man behind New York City’s draconian COVID response, who by his own admission secretly broke the rules to take part in drug-fueled sex parties.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the mandates began to ease in August, indoor dining was permitted, museums, bowling alleys and other cultural institutes were reopened — but schools remained closed, the lawsuit notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teachers who refused to get a vaccine were suspended without pay and in some cases fired, the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was no data of any kind to suggest that the Former Mayor’s closing of public schools was based on any scientific evidence. The evidence suggests that the school closures were driven by the needs of the teacher’s union leadership, not the safety of the children,” the suit claims. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It also holds the ex-mayor’s administration responsible for ongoing poor mental health and dipping test scores among public school students who were forced into homeschooling at the time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also holds the policies backed by the de Blasio administration responsible for ongoing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/27/amid-the-pandemic-exodus-from-americas-public-schools/"&gt;poor mental health and dipping test scores&lt;/a&gt; among public school students who were forced into homeschooling during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit notes the alleged “preferential treatment of certain employees and supervisors” such as Varma and police officer Kimberly Lucas, who in May pleaded guilty to submitting a fraudulent vaccine card.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucas lost vacation days and was put on a one-year dismissal probation while “thousands of city workers were fired without due process for rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine and being honest about not receiving it,” the suit states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then-NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/07/01/covid-vaccine-lie-edward-caban-nypd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; he mitigated the penalty for Lucas because of her “nine years of exemplary service as a police officer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The de Blasio administration is being questioned about why it allowed George Floyd protests to surge for months, while small businesses and religious institutions were shuttered.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It appears that these working-class New Yorkers were only fired because they were not wealthy, politically connected, or refused to submit fraudulent vaccine cards,” the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attorney Jimmy Wagner, who filed the suit on behalf of the six city lawmakers, said the petition does not seek monetary damages, but rather, the plaintiffs aim to get answers from the former administration “in writing” about the pandemic-era mandates to “protect New Yorkers from suffering a similar fate in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happened during the pandemic in New York City was executive tyrannical authority,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not how our system is supposed to operate. They outcasted anyone who dared question the mandate,” Wagner charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hearing in the case has been set for early February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city Law Department, which is repping all defendants except Lucas, did not immediately comment. It’s not clear who is representing Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops have identified the woman who was lit on fire as she slept and then burned to death on a Brooklyn subway train while terrified straphangers watched in horror, law-enforcement sources said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman — who sources said was originally from New Jersey — was sleeping on an F train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22 when she was set on fire — with illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil now facing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/illegal-immigrant-faces-murder-rap-for-allegedly-burning-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-as-da-promises-most-serious-consequences/"&gt;first-degree murder charges&lt;/a&gt; in the sick attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Horrifying video footage shows the accused killer fanning the flames as the woman burned — and calmly watching the scorched victim from a bench on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim of the horrifying Dec. 22 subway arson attack was so badly burned that she initially remained unidentified. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Coalition for the Homeless &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;described her as homeless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of the woman — who was finally ID’d through fingerprints — is being publicly withheld pending family notification, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A source told The Post she was alive when she was set on fire, with a walker and several bags nearby. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/woman-torched-to-death-on-mta-train-allegedly-by-illegal-migrant-still-cannot-be-idd-three-days-after-horrifying-attack-due-to-severe-burns-sources/"&gt;medical examiner struggled to identify&lt;/a&gt; the body because it was so severely burned in the attack, relying largely on dental records when it became impossible to pull fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, allegedly watched the woman burn after the Dec. 22 attack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;According to police Sebastian Zapeta-Calil left the Brooklyn station but was nabbed by NYPD cops in Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zapeta-Calil, who was arraigned on first- and second-degree murder and arson charges, is being held at Rikers Island without bail pending. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration officials said he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/nyc-subway-burn-suspect-is-illegal-migrant-from-guatemala-who-sneaked-into-us-after-being-deported/"&gt;entered the US illegally in 2018&lt;/a&gt; but was deported less than a week later — only to find his way back into the country and to the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By March 2023, he was living in the New York City shelter system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is charged with first-degree murder in the sick Brooklyn subway arson attack on Dec. 22. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pal at the Brooklyn facility where he last shacked up told The Post the migrant was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/sebastian-zapeta-calil-charged-in-womans-burning-death-on-nyc-subway-often-bugged-out-after-smoking-k2-shelter-roommate/"&gt;addicted to smoking the synthetic drug K2&lt;/a&gt; and drank heavily on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accused killer allegedly told cops he was so high he didn’t remember lighting the fire. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He smoked K2, drank and bugged out,” said shelter resident Raymond Robinson, who slept in a cot at the facility next to Zapeta-Calil until his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but never harmed nobody but himself,” Robinson said. “That’s why this s–t f–ked my head up because I slept next to him and he was never like that. I wouldn’t leave my daughter with anybody but he was the type of dude I could trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As long as he wasn’t high,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robinson said Zapeta-Calil liked to drink Voda vodka, “the cheapest s–t there is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to start your year off on a high note.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Legalized marijuana means New York’s 267 licensed dispensaries are offering strange new holiday gifts for the stoner who has it all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if shoppers missed the chance to stuff Christmas stockings with a stash, there’s still a chance to make it a high Hanukkah with products like THC-infused olive oil and Kosher pot gummies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Frankincense and myrrh? Great for the wise men. For everyone else, there’s cannabis,” said Melany Dobson, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/bargain-buzz-ny-pot-farm-moves-100000-economical-dime-bags-under-legalization/"&gt;upstate weed grower &lt;/a&gt;and cultivator Hudson Cannabis Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hudson Sour — available in “dime,” $9 and $10 bags, one-eighth of an ounce or 3.5 grams — packs a wallop with 34% THC.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes the best presents aren’t just things — they’re a chance to open your loved one’s eyes to how much better life can feel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Cannabis is marketing a popular marijuana strain — &lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/"&gt;Sour &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/"&gt;iesel &lt;/a&gt;— at as many as 175 retail and delivery shops across the state. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Sour — available in “dime,” $9 and $10 bags, one-eighth of an ounce or 3.5 grams — packs a wallop with 34% THC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From pot farm to table&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lisa Barone and Mike Nelson, chefs-turned-farmers at the Herbal Confectionery in New Paltz, are selling &lt;a href="https://menus.dispenseapp.com/8d52fec99a0f1d97/menu/categories/a90e815c263e3128" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cannabis-infused oils &lt;/a&gt;to elevate your holiday meals to a new high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The line of 240 milligram products include Rosemary Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Sage Sunflower Oil and Lemongrass Coconut Oil, and go for $45 at the Weedery in downtown New Paltz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn-based &lt;a href="https://chefforhigher.com/cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chef for Higher &lt;/a&gt;also offers cannabis-infused honey as well as extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis-infused honey is selling extremely well,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/pot-home-delivery-firm-taps-stoners-to-rate-weed/"&gt;said Osbert Orduna&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of The Cannabis Place on Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village, &lt;a href="https://thecannabisplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;which carries&lt;/a&gt; Chef for Higher products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Herbal Confectionery in New Paltz, is selling cannabis-infused oils to elevate your holiday meals to a new high.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orduna said a weed-infused brownie bake mix is also popular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cannabis Place also offers gift certificates of $25, $50, $75 and $100 and is a Toys for Tots site — so customers can drop off gifts for needy kids while indulging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pre-rolled: ‘The new wine’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also the 10-pack, half-gram &lt;a href="https://jennyloves.me/petits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pre-rolled joints &lt;/a&gt;— Petit J’s — manufactured by cultivator Jenny’s and sold for about $50 at 16 licensed weed shops in New York City and others across the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the right price. The pre-rolls are doing really well,” said owner Jenny Argie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger adults are gravitating to cannabis products more than booze, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is the new wine, the new whisky. Young people are looking for an alternative to alcohol,” Argie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Something to chew on&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jenny’s also offers a whole line of Kosher, vegan and zero glycemic or sugar-free edible cannabis products such as Go-Go and Zee-Zee gummies and chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These edibles are great for Hanukkah,” Argie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lowell Smokes offers pre-rolled weed now available in many New York retail dispensaries. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daniel Wood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also pot available from California for those who pine for West Coast weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those struggling through another New York winter, they can dream of Pacific beaches with Lowell Smokes, which offers &lt;a href="https://happydaysli.com/shop/farmingdale/lowell%20farms/the-mind-safari-hybrid-6g-prerolls-6pk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pre-rolled weed&lt;/a&gt; now available in many New York retail dispensaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fighting pain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Cannabis sells Rick Simpson Oil aimed at fighting pain or inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The one-gram “Farmers Blend” oil includes three different weed strains and is sold in a sleek dispenser, containing 35 milligrams of THC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One dose per click can be consumed orally, topically on the skin, or by adding to a joint or smoking device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get this oil for someone on the first night of Chanukah and we guarantee it’ll last all 8 days, and beyond,” Hudson Co. boasts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another cannabis manufacturer, 1906, is &lt;a href="https://1906.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;selling gummies&lt;/a&gt; for people seeking fast-acting pain relief — called sour watermelon-flavored Pain AM and plum-flavored Pain PM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just showing up at a pot shop can get customers into the Christmas spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, customers can buy &lt;a href="https://hwcannabis.co/menu/delivery/brands/cartography-429456/?order=-inserted_at" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Housing Works-Cartography&lt;/a&gt; jewelry with “Stoner” nameplates for pot aficionados, with prices ranging from $155 to $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But stoners need accessories too. There are companies — such as &lt;a href="https://blazysusan.com/product-category/rolling-trays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Blazy Susan&lt;/a&gt; — that sell rolling papers, pre-rolled cones and rolling trays for consuming marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoo’s that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A snowy owl was spotted swooping into Shirley Chisholm State Park over the holiday weekend — marking its first appearance in the Big Apple in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rare sighting drove hordes of curious photographers, birders and wildlife enthusiasts — hoping for a glimpse of the majestic yellow-eyed bird — to the Fountain Avenue side of the Brooklyn nature preserve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A snowy owl was spotted swooping into Shirley Chisholm State Park. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Caren Jahre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the most beautiful and distinct owls in the world,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/08/us-news/wild-turkey-spotted-strutting-around-manhattan-after-epic-journey/"&gt;David Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, a birder and founder of &lt;a href="https://x.com/BirdCentralPark?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Manhattan Bird Alert&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post. “It’s the owl from Harry Potter — Hedwig. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a rarity. It’s a rare sighting in New York City, generally one we only get in the middle of winter.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The mostly polar white owl — hence the winter weather moniker — was first seen late Saturday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barrett said the last substantial sighting came in 2022, noting this year’s visit is part of a snowy owl irruption — an unpredictable migration pattern resulting from a successful breeding season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a snowy owl was also spotted &lt;a href="https://x.com/BayRidgeAlerts/status/1866600704812408862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;on a floating barge in Bay Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. But by the time reports of the sighting surfaced, the bird had flown the coop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That also is the last time we know of a ‘chaseable’ report in Brooklyn prior to today,” Barrett said. “After two years with nearly no Snowy Owl irruption in the New York City and Long Island area. … Long Island’s south shore already has had multiple reports of Snowy Owls this season.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This year’s visit is part of a snowy owl irruption — an unpredictable migration pattern resulting from a successful breeding season.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of David Barrett&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the Brooklyn park was crawling with binocular-laden birders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s an otherworldly experience,” Edmund Berry, 40, told The Post after making the trek from Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berry, who has photographed hundreds of different birds across North America — including a number of snowy owls — likened the New York City sighting to a transcendent moment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s remarkable to see something that so clearly comes from the Arctic,” he said. “Seeing one in person is just a jaw-dropping experience every time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barrett noted that the owl — likely a first-year bird that was hatched this summer — had probably flown more than 1,000 miles before landing in the Five Boroughs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The rare sighting drove hordes of curious photographers, birders and wildlife enthusiasts to the Fountain Avenue side of the Brooklyn nature preserve. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Gus Keri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate the entire population is less than 30,000 in North America — and only a fraction of those migrate a long distance in a given year — making the owl’s cameo all the more unusual.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shirley Chisholm State Park is an excellent habitat for a Snowy Owl — relatively flat and not densely forested, with plenty of rats,” he added. “Snowy owls have no problem transitioning their hunting from the much smaller lemmings of the Arctic tundra to heftier New York City rats!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birder Gus Keri ventured out to the park around 8 a.m. Sunday where, amidst the fog, he found the owl perched near a path. He compared laying eyes on it to a “spiritual experience.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The moment I saw my first snowy owl, I fell in love with this species,” Keri said. “And I became obsessed when I heard about one, especially if it was in Brooklyn. I immediately wanted to share my happiness with everyone. It was an amazing experience.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A wildlife photographer noted that the owl — likely a first-year bird that hatched this summer — had probably flown more than 1,000 miles before landing in the Five Boroughs.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Edmund Berry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:30 p.m. Sunday, however, the snowy owl — perhaps feeling the weight of wandering eyes — abruptly abandoned its perch atop the park.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birders observed the owl taking flight over the Atlantic Ocean before settling on an undisclosed island in the bay. And it &lt;a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S207200884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;was still partially viewable&lt;/a&gt; on the small landmass Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a possibility it could remain in the Big Apple for the winter. And possible sightings of other snowy owls could occur through March, when they make their enduring journey back to the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They come back — birds can fly, so you never know what you’re going to get,” Berry added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Connecticut man facing multiple charges in the deaths of a mother and her infant son allegedly killed them over money the woman owed him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New details were released about the November arrest of Lance “Macho” Morales, 23, following his first appearance in a Hartford, Connecticut, courtroom on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales is accused of killing 20-year-old Jessiah Mercado and her 4-month-old son Messiah Diaz in a drive-by shooting on Nov. 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An arrest warrant alleged Morales opened fire on the car the two were in because Mercado owed him $400 for using his Mazda SUV, The Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was charging her $100 a day to rent the vehicle, and she reportedly fell behind on the payments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the deadly shooting in broad daylight, an exchange took place between Morales and Mercado, in which she told him her infant son was inside the SUV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New details were released about the November arrest of Lance “Macho” Morales, 23, following his first appearance in Hartford, Connecticut.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Morales is accused of killing 20-year-old Jessiah Mercado and her 4-month-old son Messiah Diaz in a drive-by shooting on Nov. 19. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Carmon Community Funeral Homes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A witness told police that Morales said he didn’t care, The AP reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two other people were inside the car during the brazen crime, but only one of them was wounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales’ firearm was believed to be fully automatic, according to the arrest warrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An arrest warrant alleged Morales opened fire on the car the two were in because Mercado owed him $400 for using his Mazda SUV. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A massive four-day manhunt took place for Morales following the deadly shooting, and he was ultimately arrested in Puerto Rico on Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was extradited to Connecticut on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales is charged with two counts of murder, assault and other crimes, and is facing life in prison without parole if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was ordered to be held on $5 million bail during Monday’s court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former president becoming the first in US history to be convicted of felony crimes, a mayor charged with taking bribes and an alleged assassin with legions of twisted fans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They and other high-profile figures took center stage during a dizzying and dramatic year in New York’s courts — as The Post was there to chronicle every gripping moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are just seven of the most dramatic scenes to unfold in city courthouses in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. Ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani erupts in court where he was once lionized&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudy Giuliani shot to fame as a crusading US Attorney in Manhattan federal court, where he pioneered aggressive mob prosecutions in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Giuliani erupted after the judge questioned why he hadn’t turned over the title to a car he owes Georgia election workers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;But the former New York City mayor &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/rudy-giuliani-erupts-at-nyc-federal-judge-as-january-trial-date-set-in-148m-defamation-case/"&gt;in November blew an epic fuse &lt;/a&gt;in the very same district, after a federal judge brought up his legendary past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Giuliani, 80, erupted as District Judge Lewis Liman grilled him over why he had not turned over the title &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/rudy-giuliani-shows-up-to-trump-polling-site-in-vintage-mercedes-hes-been-ordered-to-surrender-to-election-workers-he-defamed/"&gt;to his 1980 Mercedes convertible&lt;/a&gt; to two Georgia election workers he’s been found liable of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/rudy-giuliani-still-defaming-election-workers-even-after-he-was-ordered-to-pay-148m-judgment-lawyers/"&gt;defaming after the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your client is a competent person. He was the US Attorney in this district,” Liman said, addressing Giuliani’s lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The notion that he can’t apply for a title certificate,” he continued — before Giuliani cut him off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The tirade came in the same Manhattan federal court district where Giuliani was once the US Attorney. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I did apply for it!” Giuliani pleaded. “What am I supposed to do, make it up myself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every implication that you’ve made is against me!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A trial over whether Giuliani will be forced to give up his Florida apartment and Yankees World Series rings to the Georgia election workers is set for Jan. 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Disgraced NJ Sen. Bob Menendez blames his wife for gold bar bribes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez’s bribery trial revealed a lot about the disgraced Democrat — including &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/10/us-news/sen-bob-menendez-allegedly-bragged-to-nj-businessman-who-bought-wife-mercedes-i-saved-your-ass/"&gt;his taste for swigging Cognac in his yard and dining at the Garden State’s swankiest eateries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The former senator’s lawyers blamed his wife for the gold bars found in their bedroom. Jurors didn’t buy it. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most memorable moment of the Manhattan federal court case came during opening statements, where the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/us-news/opening-statements-begin-at-sen-bob-menendez-corruption-trial/"&gt;then-senator blamed his own wife for the gold bars &lt;/a&gt;FBI agents found in their home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The veteran lawmaker’s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, claimed to jurors that the “dazzling, tall” Nadine Menendez “sidelined” her hubby and stashed away the treasure without his knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “blame-my-wife” legal strategy did not work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menendez was convicted in July of pocketing the gold bars, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a Mercedes, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/us-news/sen-bob-menendez-convicted-of-sprawling-gold-bar-bribery-scheme/"&gt;in exchange for wielding his influence to benefit three New Jersey businessmen&lt;/a&gt; and the governments of Qatar and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs hit with bombshell indictment alleging he orchestrated sick ‘freak-offs’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sean “Diddy” Combs’ indictment unsealed in September &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-charged-in-sex-trafficking-probe/"&gt;marked an epic fall from grace&lt;/a&gt; for a man once considered to be the most powerful mogul in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combs — who was ordered to cool his heels at Brooklyn’s troubled Metropolitan Detention Center until his May 2025 trial — pleaded not guilty to racketeering and sex trafficking charges at his Manhattan federal court arraignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Combs has been ordered held without bail at a Brooklyn lockup until his trial. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the feds, the über-wealthy “I’ll Be Missing You” rapper ran his label, Bad Boy Records, as a criminal enterprise, with himself as the kingpin, for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Court papers accuse him of abusing, threatening and coercing women “to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The indictment — which echoed allegations made by Combs’ ex-girlfriend &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/disturbing-diddy-abuse-allegations-first-came-to-light-in-quickly-settled-suit-with-ex-girlfriend-cassie/"&gt;Cassie Ventura in a civil suit filed a year earlier&lt;/a&gt; — describes so-called “freak-offs,” days-long sexual performances in which Combs allegedly forced his lovers to have sex with male prostitutes while he watched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Daniel Penny beats the rap in fatal subway chokehold of Jordan Neely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manhattan prosecutors admitted at the start of Daniel Penny’s trial in October that it “won’t be easy” to convict the Marine veteran of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/us-news/jury-selection-starts-in-daniel-pennys-trial-over-shocking-fatal-subway-chokehold/"&gt;“recklessly” choking mentally ill homeless man Jordan Neely to death&lt;/a&gt; on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was still stunning to see just how quickly the Long Island native went from facing up to 15 years in prison to being &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/daniel-penny-cleared-of-all-charges-in-jordan-neelys-death/"&gt;cleared of all charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Penny went bar-hopping with his lawyers, Tom Kenniff and Steven Raiser, after jurors issued the not-guilty verdict. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/daniel-penny-trial-judge-agrees-to-drop-top-manslaughter-count-after-jury-deadlocks-twice/"&gt;took the drastic step late on a Friday of moving to toss the top charge&lt;/a&gt; of manslaughter after jurors twice said they couldn’t agree on a verdict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision was made in the hope that jurors would convict on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the 12 Manhattanites quickly acquitted Penny, 26, when they resumed deliberations after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the jury forewoman read out the words “not guilty,” Penny — who had sat stone-faced for most of the four-week trial — broke out a huge smile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Marine veteran went from facing up to 15 years in prison to being cleared of all charges in just a few dramatic days. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch for the nypost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His supporters erupted in applause, prompting anger from Neely’s devastated father, Andre Zachary, who court officers ended up escorting out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It really, really hurts,” Zachary told reporters afterward. “I had enough of this. The system is rigged.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mayor Eric Adams, ex-cop who ran on fighting crime, charged with corruption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/10/the-post-says-eric-adams-should-be-nycs-next-mayor/"&gt;promised New Yorkers during his 2021 campaign that he would crack down on crime&lt;/a&gt;, which skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The feds confronted him in September, however, with alleged crimes of his own to answer for — and Adams became the first New York City mayor &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-indicted-by-grand-jury-in-historic-federal-probe-sources/"&gt;to be charged with a federal crime &lt;/a&gt;while in office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adams has pleaded not guilty, maintained his innocence, and is running for re-election in 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege he took luxury travel perk bribes from Turkish nationals — and returned the favor by pressuring officials to fast-track the opening of Manhattan’s Turkish consulate building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s also charged with defrauding taxpayers by welcoming phony campaign donations from Turks that were “matched” by city funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams has denied criminal wrongdoing. His trial has been scheduled for May 21, 2025, smack in the middle of his re-election campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Luigi Mangione faces bizarre helipad ‘perp walk’ — and matches sweaters with lawyer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone seemingly wants a piece of Luigi Mangione, the Ivy League university graduate&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/accused-ceo-killer-luigi-mangione-may-have-been-plotting-attack-against-brian-thompson-as-far-back-as-august/"&gt; charged with executing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson &lt;/a&gt;in cold blood on a Midtown sidewalk in December.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours before the 26-year-old Maryland native was set to appear in Manhattan state court — where he’s charged with murder as an “act of terrorism” — the feds &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/luigi-mangione-hit-with-federal-charges-making-him-eligible-for-death-penalty-in-alleged-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson/"&gt;swooped in with their own case.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small army of automatic rifle-bearing NYPD officers, FBI agents — and even the mayor — paraded Mangione in front of the media as they escorted him out of a police helicopter after he was extradited to New York City from Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A small army of NYPD and FBI officials led Mangione off of a police helicopter in a cinematic scene. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days after he made a brief appearance in Manhattan federal court, cops led Mangione down a state courthouse hallway for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-in-court-in-murder-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson/"&gt;yet another camera-ready perp walk &lt;/a&gt;in the district attorney’s case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accused killer strode into Manhattan Supreme Court clad in a maroon sweater over a white collared shirt, which matched the similarly layered sweater fit of his lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has pleaded not guilty. His next hearing in state court is scheduled for Feb. 21, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Donald Trump convicted in historic ‘hush money’ case after Stormy Daniels showdown&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald Trump was convicted by a Manhattan jury in May &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/donald-trump-convicted-of-illegally-fudging-business-records-in-historic-manhattan-hush-money-case/"&gt;on 34 felony counts of fudging business records&lt;/a&gt; to cover up a payoff to former porn star Stormy Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The historic verdict followed a wild, seven-week trial that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/us-news/trump-mouths-bullsh-t-during-salacious-stormy-daniels-testimony-at-hush-money-trial/"&gt;saw X-rated testimony from Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, who described an alleged brief sexual encounter with Trump as he sat fuming at the defense table in Manhattan Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jurors at the infamous “hush money” trial struggled to keep a straight face as Daniels — talking fast and gesturing wildly — described spanking Trump with a rolled-up magazine that had his face on the cover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Daniels testified that she had brief and unsatisfying sex with Trump, who sat fuming at the defense table. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The salacious quip caused Trump to reportedly turn to his lawyers and say, “That’s bulls–t,” — and drew a rebuke from the judge, who warned the ex-president about “audibly cursing” in front of jurors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But polling consistently showed that the voters did not care about the outcome of the case — which Trump ripped as a “politically motivated” bid to beat him in the courts rather than at the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trump was convicted of falsifying business records, but the verdict did not stop him from winning back the White House. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in November, America &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/us-news/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election-defying-the-odds-again/"&gt;sent a convicted felon to the White House&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump’s lawyers have urged the trial judge to throw out the conviction in light of his election, and have vowed to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year — and see you back in court in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A political war on the Hudson erupted Monday over New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the MTA’s controversial $9 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/hochul-announces-nyc-congestion-pricing-to-begin-january/"&gt;congestion toll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA can now begin collecting the first-in-the-nation congestion fee on Sunday, Jan. 5, to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street — following a federal judge’s ruling in Newark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Judge Leo Gordon said environmental mitigation concerns on the Jersey side of the Hudson have to be addressed, he chose not to issue a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the toll in his 72-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The MTA can now begin collecting the first-in-the-nation congestion fee on Sunday, Jan. 5, to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The decision does not interfere with the program’s scheduled implementation this coming Sunday, January 5,” said MTA chairman Janno Lieber.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul hailed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the best efforts of the State of New Jersey trying to thwart New York’s ability to reduce congestion on our streets while making long-overdue investments in public transit, our position has prevailed in court on nearly every issue,” she said in a Monday night statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a massive win for commuters in both New York and New Jersey. Now that the judge has issued his ruling, the program will move forward this weekend with a 40 percent reduction in the originally proposed cost of the toll,” she added, noting the originally proposed fee was $15.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the Garden State claimed the ruling does pump the brakes on the new toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the court’s ruling today in the congestion pricing lawsuit. Because of New Jersey’s litigation, the judge has ordered a remand, and the MTA therefore cannot proceed with implementing the current congestion pricing proposal on January 5, 2025,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A map detailing the new congestion-pricing zone and traffic routes.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sum, Gordon largely sided with the MTA and the US Department of Transportation — the defendants in the suit — over New Jersey, the plaintiff, regarding the extensive environmental assessments conducted over the impact of congestion pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the judge said the defendants erred in not providing enough specifics of measures to mitigate environmental impacts from diverted traffic in Jersey communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, congestion pricing provides specific funds for the Bronx, including $15 million to replace diesel-powered transport refrigeration units at the Hunts Point Produce Market, $20 million to fund an asthma care center and $10 million to add air filtration systems to schools near highways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hochul originally tabled a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited until after the election to push a $9 commuter tax. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No such mitigation measures — in terms of addressing pollution — are provided to New Jersey’s impacted communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge said the defendants didn’t explain why “they were able to set with precision monetary amounts dedicated to relief in New York while providing no minimum amounts for mitigation for potentially impacted areas in New Jersey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The court must conclude that the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration] and Project Sponsors acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in reaching their mitigation determination in the Final EA,” Gordon noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge gave the FHWA until Jan. 17 to take actions to comply with the ruling regarding mitigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Backers, including Hochul, said revenues from the new toll will help fund mass transit and curb traffic while opponents say it’s a cash grab for the spendthrift MTA. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul originally tabled&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/05/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-considering-delaying-congestion-pricing-report/"&gt; a $15 proposed toll &lt;/a&gt;to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited until after the election to push a $9 commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan federal judge last week also rejected a bid from plaintiffs — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/06/metro/uft-paying-costs-of-staten-island-congestion-pricing-fight/"&gt;including the United Federation of Teachers&lt;/a&gt; and Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella — to block implementation of the toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backers, including Hochul, said revenues from the new toll will help fund mass transit and curb traffic while opponents say it’s a cash grab for the spendthrift MTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one remaining anti-toll case brought by Hempstead Town Supervisor Don Clavin, pending in Brooklyn federal court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman who was murdered by a group of men in Queens more than three decades ago has finally been identified – through advanced DNA testing – as a mom who went missing soon after celebrating her daughter’s first birthday, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judy Rodriguez was 30 when her family reported her missing on January 23, 1991, a short time after her daughter Stephanie’s first birthday party. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several months later, on Aug. 25, 1991, an unidentified woman’s body was found hidden under a large wooden board – with a cord binding her ankles – in a grassy area where the Cross Island and Southern State parkways meet, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An in-depth DNA analysis revealed — 33 years later — that Rodriguez was in fact the victim of the gruesome slaying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really is heartwarming to have answers,” Anna Salvadore, Rodriguez’s sister, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/queens/nyc-family-gets-answers-mystery-disappearance-dna/6086514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told NBC 4 New York&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The investigation revealed that four men approached Rodriguez sometime between July 15 and Aug. 15, and took her on a nightmarish drive where two of them tied her up, according to the DA’s office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They drove her to the drop-off spot – pushing her out of the car, where one of the brutes struck her on the head with a large metal flashlight, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blow caused her death, according to prosecutors, who said that the violent foursome then drove away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crew returned to the scene about two weeks later, and attempted to conceal the body by covering their victim with a large wooden board, the DA’s office charged. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four men – two 20-year-olds and the others ages 18 and 19 at the time of the killing – were arrested and charged in August and September of that same year, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of them pleaded guilty in September of 1992 to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25 years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was cut loose in 2009 on parole, which discharged him in August of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two others pleaded guilty in October 1992 to first-degree reckless endangerment and were sentenced to 2 1/3 to seven years in prison, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both were released in 1996 and discharged from parole in April of 1998. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final suspect pleaded guilty in February of 1993 to hindering prosecution and received a sentence of 1 ½ to 4 ½ years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was also released to parole in 1996 and ultimately discharged in July of the following year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigation was revived in November of 2023, when the Queens DA’s Cold Case Unit and the NYPD called in a private lab to help them with clues on the victim’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then in April of 2024, DNA Labs International used advanced DNA testing of the victim’s skeletal remains to produce a comprehensive genealogical profile, which was uploaded to public databases, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detective Joseph Rodriguez of the NYPD’s Investigative Genealogy Squad then used the results to build a family tree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salvadore told NBC her own daughter had submitted a DNA sample to a database and allowed law enforcement to review it – which ultimately opened the door to answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An NYPD genealogist called Salvatore, confirming “a possible DNA match to a missing person,” she told the network. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I immediately got chills when I heard the message,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A detective then asked Judy Rodriguez’s daughter Stephanie to submit samples for testing as well, the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It came back a 100% match on the anniversary of my mom’s passing,” she told NBC. “I felt like it was my mom giving us answers. It was incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family is now planning to bury Judy near her near her parents and hold a proper memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Honestly happy that we are able to put her to rest. And that we were able to find her,” Stephanie Rodriguez told the network. “It’s bittersweet but I’m so grateful we have answers. So grateful, beyond blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz commended all of the agencies involved for finally bringing closure to the grieving family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Three decades ago, four men were convicted for a gruesome killing of an unidentified woman,” Katz said in a statement. “Though justice was served, the family went 33 long years without any answers about their loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to our partners at the NYPD and the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, we have now provided those crucial details, which I hope brings a measure of solace,” she added. “This case is a prime example of the determination of my Cold Case Unit in identifying victims and solving the borough’s oldest, most challenging homicides.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rep. Grace Meng, who secured a $500,000 grant for the DA’s office to investigate cold cases, also applauded the long-awaited break in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This latest case from 1991 underscores why this money is so important, and it’s an example of the types of cases it will be used to solve,” Meng said. “I’m proud to work with District Attorney Katz in pursuing justice for the victims of cold cases in Queens, and I continue to stand with her in never forgetting about them and their loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops are searching for a man who shot six people, including a 12-year-old girl, in the Bronx on Monday afternoon, sending all of them to the hospital.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened around 4:50 p.m. at 3544 White Plains Road — roughly a block from Marcus Garvey Square in Olinville, according to the NYPD. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were shot in the Bronx on Monday afternoon, police said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Citizen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what sparked the gunfire, but cops said they found three men, two women and the young girl with bullet wounds when they arrived. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise ages of the other victims is currently unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The wounded were brought to area hospitals, where they are in stable condition, cops said. The 12 year-old’s injuries are not serious, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, police are searching for the suspect, who fled wearing all black except for a blue surgical mask covering his face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a New Year’s ball drop we’d all like to soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The estimated 1 million revelers set to ring in 2025 in the Big Apple are in for a very soggy time in Times Square, with rain expected to soak the city all night on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, rain is expected to move into the New York City area around 7 p.m. and likely linger through midnight,” Fox Forecast Center Meteorologist Stephanie van Oppen told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a chance of some very heavy rain between 10 and 11 p.m. that will be potentially disruptive for anyone outside trying to see the ball drop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy downpours have the potential to persist through 1 or 2 a.m. on New Year’s Day, creating possible snarls for New Yorkers heading home from their New Years celebrations. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The weather is expected to clear up by Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are expected to stay mild, in the 40s and 50s, through the New Year’s festivities, according to van Oppen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wet weather will soak much of the East Coast for the holiday, thanks to a storm system that is moving into the Interstate 95 corridor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures will likely cool off moving into Wednesday, and the storm system could even produce snow in areas like Buffalo and Watertown, van Oppen said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers, however, will likely have to wait longer for their first snowfall of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims of notorious Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/metro/madoff-victims-paid-another-158m-by-compensation-fund-feds/"&gt;receiving their final payments&lt;/a&gt; — bringing the total amount doled out by a compensation fund to over $4.3 billion, the feds announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Madoff Victim Fund began distributing its 10th and last payment of $131.4 million to more than 23,000 victims worldwide, according to the Manhattan US Attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice set up the fund over a decade ago to repay people swindled by Madoff — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/14/bernie-madoff-infamous-ponzi-schemer-dead-at-82/"&gt;who died behind bars&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 while serving out a 150-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Victims of Bernie Madoff’s global Ponzi scheme have been paid by a compensation fund $131 million, in the funds final payment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, 40,930 of Madoff’s victims from 127 counties have recouped over $4.3 billion in compensation — or 93.71% of their losses, the feds said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff’s massive ripoff — believed to be the biggest stock fraud in history — came to light roughly 16 years ago during the financial crisis of the late 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The reviled scammer &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2009/03/13/madoff-bares-his-65-billion-lie/"&gt;pleaded guilty to 11 financial crimes&lt;/a&gt; — including fraud, money-laundering and perjury — in 2009 for swindling investors, friends and family through the crooked wealth management company he founded in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting around the 1990s, the fraudster collected money from others through his company Bernie L. Madoff Investment Securities with the promise he’d invest it — but then he never did, he admitted at his sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and died while he was serving his prison sentence in 2021. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His victims included charities and retirees who entrusted their life savings to him, as well as New York University, the International Olympic Committee and notable figures like former Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katsenberg, legendary Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and Hollywood couple Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff’s fraud has been tied to at least four suicides, including his elder son Mark’s, who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/15/what-happened-to-bernie-madoffs-family-after-ponzi-scheme/"&gt;hanged himself&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 11, 2010 — the two-year anniversary of his dad’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His younger son Andrew also blamed Madoff for the recurrence of the rare cancer, mantle-cell lymphoma, that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2014/09/03/bernie-madoffs-son-andrew-dead-at-48-after-cancer-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed him in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Madoff was sentenced to 150 years behind bars for carrying out the world’s largest fraud.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff was sentenced in June 2009 to a century-and-a-half behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and his co-conspirators, including brother Peter Madoff, were forced to fork over the ill-gotten gains as part of the prosecution by the Manhattan US attorney’s office — funds used to pay back victims, the feds said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, about $2.2 billion of the victim compensation funds were collected from the estate of a deceased Madoff investor, Jeffry Picower, and another $1.7 billion came as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This Office has never stopped pursuing justice for victims of history’s largest Ponzi scheme,” said Acting Manhattan US Attorney Edward Kim in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOJ “is committed to protecting and assisting victims of crime, no matter how long it takes and no matter how complicated the endeavor,” Kim added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff in 2020 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/05/bernie-madoff-has-less-than-18-months-to-live-seeks-release-from-prison/"&gt;asked for compassionate release&lt;/a&gt; from prison, claiming he only had months to live because he had kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his bid to be freed was denied after some 500 victims&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/05/bernie-madoff-should-die-behind-bars-prosecutors/"&gt; wrote letters to a judge&lt;/a&gt; saying Madoff should die behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also asked Trump in 2019 to reduce his prison term, but the request went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/01/bernie-madoff-died-of-kidney-disease-hypertension-according-to-death-certificate/"&gt;died at 82 of kidney disease and hypertension&lt;/a&gt; on April 14, 2021 at a federal lockup in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New NYPD video shows the mysterious masked person who authorities believe&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/cops-find-newborn-girl-in-tote-bag-dumped-outside-in-nyc/"&gt; abandoned a newborn baby girl &lt;/a&gt;stuffed inside a tote bag in front of a Bronx apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The footage, released early Monday, shows the unidentified person walking on the rain-drenched Morrisania sidewalk Sunday morning with a hood pulled up over his or her head, wearing a black face mask and carrying a green tote bag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infant, who appears to be only a few days old&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and was swaddled in blankets inside the tote bag — was dumped outside a building on Reverend James Polite Ave. near East 167th Street around 6 a.m., cops said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baby’s cries prompted someone to call 911, law enforcement sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMS workers brought the baby to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was listed in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police were still trying Monday to track down the mystery bag carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two randy city subway workers went off the rails while on the clock, repeatedly cozying up in a car — and tipping off officials to their illicit deeds by keeping the windshield shade on while it was pitch-black out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the MTA employees — a supervising Romeo whose duties included inspecting tracks — copped to romping with his subordinate female “flagger” two to three times a week for about a year, according to a report by the MTA inspector general Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When asked if they were intimate while parked in their personal vehicles, she said they were physically&lt;br&gt;close and touched,” the agency said without identifying the pair.&lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Investigators conducted surveillance and found the duo outside MTA worksites in a car together on five separate occasions during their work shifts. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The duo worked the overnight shift at the DeKalb station in Brooklyn, where the supervisor regularly “assigned the Trackworker to flag for him”  and she provided “flagging protection for his nightly&lt;br&gt;assignments on the roadbed,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up on an anonymous tip, investigators conducted surveillance and found the duo outside MTA worksites in a car together on five separate occasions during their work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The [maintenance supervisor] and the Trackworker were observed together in a parked car registered to the Trackworker, on a quiet and secluded street, with a sunshade up in the front windshield (despite it being nighttime), for approximately three hours on one occasion and approximately one hour on the other,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, the pair took one of their cars to a laundromat and spent about an hour and 20 minutes there, the probers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After being confronted, the supervisor admitted the track worker had been “one of[his] best friends” since 2013, when they were both assigned to the Grand Central Terminal field office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said they had socialized together outside of work and “at one point had a romantic relationship and were very close.” The woman confirmed they had a romance, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lovey dovey duo violated numerous ethics and transit work rules during their hook-ups, the IG’s office found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Track workers who are not on the rails are supposed to wait for the next job assignment from the Dekalb station or other work sites, not leave the premises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Workers are also supposed to take the subway to do track work, not use a private vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are also supposed to clock out when leaving the premises during work hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The probe concluded the couple received full pay despite abandoning their shifts for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“MTA supervisors are expected to lead by example, not teach their subordinates to violate the rules and go off site together while on the clock,” said MTA IG Daniel Cort in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This case should send a clear message that my office will relentlessly pursue unethical conduct and blatant mismanagement day and night,” Cort said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hot-and-heavy behavior cost the duo tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The track worker was suspended from work without pay from June until December 2024, following an arbitration hearing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The maintenance supervisor was demoted in September, without back pay following his June suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The MTA holds its workforce to the highest standard and these two employees should have known better,” said MTA rep Joana Flores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lying and misusing work time will not be tolerated and is unacceptable. Both employees were immediately removed from service without pay and faced disciplinary action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Apple straphangers are on board. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers on Monday embraced the Guardian Angels and founder Curtis Sliwa as the anti-crime crusaders &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;resumed patrols of the troubled&lt;/a&gt; city subway system for the first time since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One grateful New Yorker even planted a kiss on Sliwa as the red-beret-wearing crew poked around the darkest corners of Bronx and Manhattan stations looking for trouble — with The Post tagging along. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa says it’s time for the group to resume subway patrols for the first time since 1980. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see ya’ll back,” Bronx resident Tammy Benson, 60, told Sliwa after giving him a kiss at the 125th Street station in Harlem. “You and them need to come back. I’m grateful to see it. I feel really blessed when I see [Sliwa] It’s been like 40 years and he’s really sweet and kind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need to come back!”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Another straphanger, Manhattanite Natalie Lora, told The Post the Angels were a welcome sight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need them,” said Lora, 40. “It’s that time: We need them again. We’re happy to see them. If you’re a native New Yorker then you know.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sliwa, a former Republican mayoral candidate, was flipping burgers as night manager at a Bronx McDonald’s when he founded the group in 1979 amid horrific subway violence at the time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Post tagged along Monday as the Guardian Angels launched new patrols of the city subway system.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two three-member crews of Guardian Angels engaged the homeless in the subways, handing out water and checking on their conditions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once topping off with thousands of members worldwide, the Guardian Angels have since returned to the underground several times — but not since the last patrols nearly 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This weekend Sliwa announced that he was taking his volunteers back into the transit system following the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;horrifying arson death of a homeless woman&lt;/a&gt; on an F train in Brooklyn earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday cops reported &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/subway-stabbing-suspect-arrested-after-slashing-victim-in-the-neck-on-platform-cops/"&gt;two more transit attacks&lt;/a&gt; — a 48-year-old man slashed in the neck at the West 50th Street and Eighth Avenue station in Manhattan and a 52-year-old man stabbed in the arm at the Myrtle-Wyckoff station on the Brooklyn-Queens border. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYPD stats show that over the past 28 days alone there were 48 felony assaults reported in the system, a jump of about 40% over the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Each three-member crew of Guardian Angels will work four-hour shifts patrolling the subways around the clock, the group said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa said the Guardian Angels will focus patrols on the F line, the same line that saw a horrific arson murder this month. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sliwa said that’s why the Angels are back on the beat in the subways. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We ride the trains and check every car and make the presence known in every car and then we get off and check the really bad stations like here at 125th and Lex,” he said. “Upstairs is like dope fiend city.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guardian Angels founding member Arnaldo Salinas said 70 people have reached out to volunteer for the subway patrols since The Post wrote about the new effort on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Salinas said applicants are carefully screened to weed out vigilantes out for blood. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“First, we do the interviews and we ask them questions like why do you want to do this, and if we get answers like ‘my mom was robbed the other day an I want to get out there and kick the f–king s–t out of somebody,’ then, no, we can’t use you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guardian Angels organizers said 70 people have volunteered to join new subway patrols since The Post wrote about them on Sunday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re one of these Bruce Lee wannabes, I’m afraid not. We can’t use you,” Salinas added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the gig is also dangerous — six Guardian Angels have been killed on patrols since 1980, and others have suffered injuries ranging from broken bones to losing an eye from an attack with a golf club.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new patrols consist of three Guardian Angels each and will run around the clock on four-hour shifts, the group said, with the F line — site of the horrific arson attack — one of the main focuses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday two teams, including Sliwa, boarded an uptown 6 train up to Harlem, then back downtown and to the Coney Island station in Brooklyn — approaching the homeless and offering to help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one station a shoeless young woman approached Sliwa — asking if he was the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa was the night manager at a Bronx McDonald’s when he founded the Guardian Angels in 1979.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa said the group will offer the homeless advice and a helping hand as they patrol the subways.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a brief conversation a bystander stepped up and gave the woman a pair of socks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“See?” Sliwa told her. “There are good people who care about you. You can get out of this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one tense encounter, Sliwa approached a man who appeared to be selling drugs at the 125th Street station, chewing out the man until he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You better get the hell out of the subway,” he told the man. “We will get you out of the subway if you’re here to sell drugs. Get the hell out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the confrontation was largely for show, it was a welcome sight for many straphangers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You guys are needed down here,” 52-year-old Bronx resident Sonny Raimundi told Sliwa as he shook his hand Monday. “You guys are for the regular people who are working the night shifts and the late shifts and down here at night alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cops can’t cover everything,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A rep for Mayor Eric Adams said the city has clamped down on crime and described the Guardian Angels new subway patrols as “theatrics.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a rep for Mayor Eric Adams on Monday maintained that cops have put a dent in crime in the city, and suggested that the Guardian Angels’ new patrols are little more than “theatrics.” Adams defeated Sliwa in the 2021 mayoral race.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The mayor surged 1,000 police officers per day into the subways, has brought down overall crime, and transit crime, delivering real action — not theatrics — but he knows there’s still more work to be done,” City Hall press secretary Kayla Mamelak said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unlike others who only seek attention with meaningless stunts, Mayor Adams remains focused on real solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new patrols come as Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,250 National Guardsmen to patrol the city’s transit system at 150 locations including the major hubs at Grand Central, Times Square and Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Hochul declined to comment on the Angels’ patrols but said the governor is working closely with City Hall and the NYPD to “remove individuals with mental illness who pose a risk to themselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul understands there’s more work to do, and she will continue working with NYPD, State Police, MTA PD, National Guard and other law enforcement personnel to make our subways safer,” spokesman Avi Small said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tourism de force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple ushered in a whopping 64.3 million visitors in 2024 — and is on track to bounce back to pre-COVID tourism levels next year, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s comeback marked the second-highest tourist count in city history, and reflected a 3.5% increase in visitors from 2023, according to a report from the New York City Tourism + Conventions group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York remains the most visited city in the United States and a top destination for international markets and major events,” said the report, released this month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Big Apple ushered in 64.3 million tourists in 2024 – and fell just short of 2019’s record-setting 66.6 million visitors, according to a report released this month from New York City Tourism + Conventions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of travelers this year fell just short of 2019’s record-setting 66.6 million — but 2025 will bring even more sightseers to the five boroughs, the city’s official tourism organization predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;More than 67 million visitors are expected to be welcomed into the Big Apple in 2025, marking a a “full recovery” back to pre-pandemic levels, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York City has once again solidified its position as the premier destination in the nation and one of the top travel spots in the world,” Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement, “and we’re looking forward to beating our own tourism record next year with a full recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pre-pandemic year of 2019 saw the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/bklyn-residents-fume-over-crowds-flocking-to-iconic-selfie-spot-in-trendy-nabe-its-like-times-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;highest number of tourists&lt;/a&gt; scrambling to New York City to date. It marked the city’s tenth consecutive record-breaking year for visitors, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/reports/osdc/tourism-industry-new-york-city#:~:text=New%20York%20City%20hosted%2066.6%20million%20visitors,a%2067%20percent%20reduction%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York State Comptroller’s Office. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourists lower their masks to take a selfie in Times Square in Manhattan in December 2021.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic “decimated the tourism sector, causing the number of travelers to the city to drop significantly,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/osdc/reports/nyc-sectors/tourism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state comptroller’s office&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, visitor spending dropped by nearly three-quarters, costing the city $1.2 billion in lost tax revenues in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourism dollars generated over $6.8 billion in tax revenue this year, which saved New York households an average of $2,000 each, according to the mayor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourists spent $51 billion directly, including on lodging, dining, entertainment and art and cultural attractions, the New York City Tourism + Conventions report found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those spending dollars included Broadway show tickets, with attendance expected to reach 12.5 million by the end of 2024 — up 9% from last year, but still down 8% from 2019, the tourism bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through November 2024, the city’s 700-plus hotels sold 24.1 million room nights – a 4.1% increase from last year, though still 6% under 2019’s level. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average daily cost of a room this year was $303, up 4.9% from 2023, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2024, we saw growth in both visitation and spending, reaching an estimated total direct spend of more than $51 billion across the city and state,” NYC Tourism + Conventions President and CEO Julie Coker said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourists’ dollars generated over $6.8 billion in tax revenue in 2024, according to the mayor’s office, which saved New York households an average of $2,000 this year.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This recovery supported over 388,000 leisure and hospitality jobs, and generated more than $6.8 billion in tax revenue, benefiting local businesses,” Coker added. “As we look ahead to 2025, we expect this momentum to continue, further strengthening NYC’s role in driving the state and local economy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of this year’s 51.3 million domestic visitors hailed from other cities – like Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple also saw an increase in European travelers, with about 13 million international arrivals — representing 50% of spending across the five boroughs, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;2025 is slated to break tourism records in the Big Apple, according to New York City Tourism + Conventions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most international travelers hailed from the U.K., with about 1.1 million visitors in 2024, followed by Canada at 1 million and France, Brazil and Italy with more than 700,000 tourists each. China followed with about 609,000 visitors, and Germany, Mexico and Australia accounted for about 500,000 visitors each, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year is also on track to be the busiest year ever for airports, the tourism group found, noting that October 2024 already marked the most bustling October of all time, with 4.3 million international passengers flowing through the New York City area’s commercial airports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite this growth, challenges remain,” the tourism report found, “including exchange rates, visa access and air travel capacity, which continue to impact business travel and long-haul international markets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, more than $20 billion is being invested across JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International airports to “improve travelers’ experiences and support continued growth,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelers celebrating the Times Square ball drop can expect a mammoth police presence and NYPD drones in sky air amid heightened global tensions — including the persistent threat of spillover violence from the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City officials say Gotham is still on high alert after Hamas’s surprise Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the seizure of hundreds of hostages — some of whom remain in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the NYPD will be out in force during the New Year’s bash, which Mayor Eric Adams said focuses the eyes of the world on the Big Apple for just one night — and makes it the “crossroads of the entire planet.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The NYPD will be out in force on New Year’s Eve, city officials said Monday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every year, thousands of people across the globe, they come here to Times Square and celebrate,” Adams said at a Monday press conference.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They see the main stage of the ball actually dropping,” he said. “What they don’t realize is how much goes on behind the scenes to ensure that people are safe.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That massive operation will involve the “full complement of our police personnel,” he said — including uniformed and plainclothes cops, horse-mounted officers, drone teams, bomb-sniffing dogs, helicopter crews and members of the NYPD’s Intelligence Bureau, Special Operations division and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, they’ll be searching for any and all threats to the gathered crowd, expected to number around 1 million people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;About a million people are expected to flock to Times Square for the celebration.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We will make sure each one of those who come here to visit and enjoy the ball drop will be safe,” Hizzoner said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch echoed Adams’ comments and said that despite no “specific, credible threats” to the New Year’s Eve celebration, the department will remain vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That includes members of some of our elite specialized units, including our emergency services unit, who will be strategically deployed throughout the area on rooftops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the department will deploy a “tremendous amount of police resources.”  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;G.N.Miller/NYPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tisch added that the NYPD is deploying dedicated pickpocket teams to collar sneak-thieves looking to take advantage of the crammed-in crowd — and said security will be tight throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All manholes, mailboxes, vending machines and litter baskets in the frozen zone will be either sealed or removed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And frozen safety lanes will be created around the event using blocker cars and concrete barriers,” she continued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;City officials stressed the need for public vigilance during the celebration.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Giovannini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And as always, there will be plenty of security measures that you will not see. No one handles large-scale events like this better than the NYPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, both Adams and Tisch stressed the need for the public to keep its eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security is everyone’s responsibility,” Adams said. “So if you see something, say something.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police commish agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public is our eyes and ears,” Tisch said. “So if you see something suspicious, or if something doesn’t look or feel right, tell a police officer or call 911 right away.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public’s ability to see something, say something and do something makes a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young humpback whale washed ashore in Long Beach on Monday morning — with authorities now working to determine why it died, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early this morning, a juvenile humpback whale was discovered washed ashore at Roosevelt beach,” Long Beach&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1008379754664176&amp;amp;set=a.223436863158473" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; police said in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. “The City is in contact with our Federal and State partners. A necropsy will be performed later this morning followed by burial. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A young humpback whale was found dead on Long Beach Monday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News12 Long Island Kurt Semder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Long Beach Police Department is calling on federal and state agencies to help determine what killed a &lt;a href="https://leebythesea.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humpback whale that washed ashore Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leebythesea.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please avoid the area to allow the various agencies to conduct their work.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whale, which is an estimated 30 feet long, has already started to draw gawkers, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/KurtSemder/status/1873765929282375931"&gt;post on X by News12 Long Island&lt;/a&gt; reporter Kurt Semder. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic Marine Conservation Society said the whale is one of several who have washed up on Long Island beaches in recent weeks, including a minke whale that washed up in Oyster Bay over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1027044229462163&amp;amp;set=a.344476274385632"&gt;according to a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another humpback washed up in Napeague on Dec. 17, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1019850903514829&amp;amp;set=a.344476274385632"&gt;the group added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Authorities say the humpback whale found dead on a Long Island beach is the latest in a series of similar incidents since 2017. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News12 Long Island Kurt Semder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Authorities are asking curious residents to stay clear of a young humpback whale that washed up dead on Long Beach. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leebythesea.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing investigation into the increased number of &lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2017-2024-minke-whale-unusual-mortality-event-along-atlantic-coast?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3bC_289KesxYax8AAKxggbgFfTksra41gJmHzUHZHoq_MInRJ2yZjtyK0_aem_SK1qKN9BNIMvjN1mH1UaWQ"&gt;minke whale deaths since 2017&lt;/a&gt;,” the society also said in a recent post on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you come across a sick, injured or deceased whale, dolphin, seal or sea turtle, it is important to report the animal to the NYS Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Hotline at (631)- 369-9829.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westchester County prosecutors have two new suspects in a controversial 1996 double murder of an upstate millionaire that spawned five trials and an overturned conviction — but no answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Westchester DA Miriam Rocah has set her sights on a pair of potential culprits who brutally killed Archie Harris, whose estate was worth in excess of $2 million at the time of his death, and his home health aide inside his Eastchester home, &lt;a href="https://www.westchesterda.net/december-2024/7129-westchester-district-attorney-miriam-e-rocah-statement-on-developments-in-investigation-into-1996-eastchester-double-murder"&gt;prosecutors announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An extensive and ongoing investigation was undertaken by my Conviction Review Unit, following a request in 2023, has identified two individuals involved in the murders of Archie Harris and Betty Ramcharan and no connection to Selwyn Davis, who was previously charged,” the DA said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Westchester DA Miriam Rocah said there are new suspects in the 1996 slaying of millionaire Archie Harris, but is passing the case on to the next prosecutor. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-86 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Archie Harris’ estate was worth $2 million at the time of his death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Harris’ home health aide Betty Ramcharan was also killed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we undergo a change in administration at the DA’s Office this week, it is my hope that these significant developments lead to continuing investigation and action so that justice can be achieved for the families of Mr. Harris and Ms. Ramcharan,” Rocah said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The violent slayings have dogged the Westchester DA’S Office for decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days, of Mount Vernon, was arrested shortly after the bodies — and Harris’ dog — were discovered on Nov. 21, 1996, all viciously beaten and stabbed to death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators set their sights on Days, whose mother, Stella Davis, the 76-year-old millionaire’s previous health care aide, had filed a sexual abuse complaint against Harris in July 1996.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The case remained cold until April 2001, when Days was indicted on murder charges based largely on an alleged confession after an intense grilling by Eastchester detectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Days’ first trial ended in a hung jury in December 2003, the first of five trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Selwyn Days spent 16 years behind bars for the 1996 double murder before he was acquitted at his fifth trial in 2017. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of second-degree murder in April 2004 and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison — only to have the conviction overturned on Dec. 31, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days’ third trial also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2011/03/10/hung-jury-in-3rd-trial-in-1996-ny-double-killing-of-archie-harris-and-betty-ramcharan/"&gt;ended in a hung jury in March 2011&lt;/a&gt;, but a fourth trial led to a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2011/12/20/ny-man-sentenced-for-1996-double-murder-in-eastchester/"&gt;new conviction seven months later&lt;/a&gt; and another 50-years-to-life sentence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, that conviction was also tossed by a state appellate court, which led to a fifth trial in 2017 that led to his acquittal on all the charges in the controversial case. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days spent 16 years behind bars before being cleared — with the case going cold again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, prosecutors announced that there were new suspects, but provided no further details. The office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rocah did not seek re-election and incoming DA Susan Cacace is set to replace her next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kitty has quite a tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tsar the house cat disappeared from his owners during an annual family photoshoot on Governors Island in October – and miraculously managed to survive in the wild for weeks in winter temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tsar the house cat disappeared on Governors Island in October after his owners brought him to a pumpkin-patch photo op there. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty astounding,” Governors Island overnight caretaker, Tristan Mariner, told The Post. “He clearly had some good instinct. He was in an area that had a heated bathroom cart, which we’re assuming he lived under – and that’s where we found him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mariner added that the 15-pound cat appeared well-fed and healthy when he was rescued Dec. 8 and probably hunted mice and sifted through the island’s various compost bins to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He must’ve been eating good somehow,” Mariner remarked, “but he was certainly relieved to have  a handful of sardines when I saw him.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Tsar’s saga began Oct. 27 when he and his owners attended the annual Pumpkin Point photo op festivities on the island, which is just a few hundred yards off Manhattan and Brooklyn and has no full-time residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finicky feline disappeared under bales of hay, and despite people searching the area for him for hours, the critter was nowhere to be found, Mariner told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We took our annual family photo with the pumpkins and Tsar (who’s been to the Island multiple times and enjoys roaming) decided to sit under the wagon of hay,” Tsar’s family wrote in an online lost-and-found pet forum post. “We called out to him a few hours later and he didn’t come, we waited until the last ferry (6 p.m.).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governors Island caretaker Tristan Mariner says Tsar (on his lap here) likely survived hunting mice and sifting through local compost bins. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Trust for Governors Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One week after Tsar’s escape, Mariner spotted the pet on the southern half of the island. But attempts to lure the cat with tuna and draw him out were unsuccessful, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other staff spotted the animal as well over the next few weeks, but none were able to secure him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A last-ditch attempt to use “humane” SPCA cat traps eventually proved fruitful, Mariner told The Post – with Tsar appearing in a trap Dec. 8, a whopping 42 days since he left his owner’s side at Pumpkin Point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to get this cat out of here,” Mariner acknowledged. “Of course, a lot of different people have different stakes. I’m a gardener, I really like birds, and cats aren’t good for birds. Also, there’s a poor cat out here in the cold, and of course I want to get him home.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The wayward cat was spotted on island security cameras in November. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Trust for Governors Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mariner, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said the timing of Tsar’s escape was crucial to fnding him: In the island’s slower winter months, he was able to dedicate more time to the rescue mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was the security team seeing him on the security cameras, combined with the horticulture team and gardeners seeing him in their area, it sort of narrowed down the score of where I was looking and eventually [where I] put the traps [down],” Mariner said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundskeeper said Tsar was found just a 4-minute walk from the site of the Pumpkin Point photo-op, describing the cat’s rescue as a “huge relief.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting,” Mariner said. “It worked out really well. … I immediately called my bosses, called the family to tell them. It was a big relief for everybody, they were really happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has lost his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/donald-trump-at-manhattan-federal-court-as-lawyers-seek-to-overturn-5m-e-jean-carroll-judgment/"&gt;bid to overturn the $5 million jury verdict&lt;/a&gt; against him in New York journalist E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Manhattan on Monday upheld the May 2023 civil verdict finding Trump, 78, liable for sexually abusing the “Ask E. Jean” advice columnist in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in 1996 and of then defaming her in a lengthy October 2022 Truth Social post calling her claims a “hoax.” &lt;/p&gt;

Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against him. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel of the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals said they weren’t persuaded by Trump’s claims that Manhattan federal Judge Lewis Liman abused his discretion at trial by giving the jury certain evidence, including &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/trump-called-access-hollywood-tape-old-news-in-deposition/"&gt;the infamous 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape&lt;/a&gt; in which Trump was caught saying he grabs women by their genitals and they let him because he’s a star.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump had also argued that he should be entitled to a new trial because of alleged errors made by Liman.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;“The district court did not abuse its discretion in making any of the challenged evidentiary rulings,” the appeals ruling read. “The jury made its assessment of the facts and claims on a properly developed record.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is also appealing an $83.3 million jury verdict from January 2024 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/07/us-news/judge-denies-trumps-bid-to-get-out-of-posting-83m-during-verdict-appeal/"&gt;finding Trump damaged Carroll’s reputation&lt;/a&gt; after she first went public with her allegations in June 2019 by claiming he’d never met her, saying she wasn’t his type and calling her a liar who was making up a story to help her sell her new memoir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carroll’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a request for comment Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 48-year-old man was slashed in the neck early Monday in the latest violence on a Big Apple subway.&lt;br&gt;The straphanger was slashed when an argument broke out on the northbound C train platform at 50th Street and 8th Avenue around 1:21 a.m., the NYPD said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photos showed police arresting a suspect — who had blood splashed over his sneakers — near 59th Street and Columbus Circle. Charges are pending, police said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former governor and potential mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo opposes Gov. Kathy Hochul’s controversial&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/hochul-announces-nyc-congestion-pricing-to-begin-january/"&gt; $9 congestion toll &lt;/a&gt;to enter Midtown Manhattan, The Post has learned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is undeniable that New York is in a dramatically different place today than it was in 2019, and without a study forecasting [the toll’s] consequences based on facts, not politics, it could do more harm than good to New York City’s recovery,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told The Post on Sunday, referring to his boss’s stance on the new commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuomo is sort of the father of congestion pricing in the US. He was largely responsible for muscling the first-in-the-nation congestion toll plan through New York’s legislature in 2019 to help fund mass transit and curb traffic in Manhattan’s central business district.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he has since backed off the tactic, writing in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/11/opinion/andrew-cuomo-yes-i-approved-congestion-pricing-but-its-time-to-hit-the-brakes/"&gt;Post op-ed column &lt;/a&gt;in March, “The people of New York know this is not the time to implement congestion pricing,” while citing a shaky post-COVID economic recovery and subway crime.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;He feels the same way now even though the toll was lowered by Hochul from $15 to 9 before it takes effect next Sunday, Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuomo’s reversal comes as he is weighing a political &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/us-news/andrew-cuomo-will-win-nyc-mayor-dem-primary-if-he-runs-thanks-to-ranked-choice-voting-adviser/"&gt;comeback bid &lt;/a&gt;for New York City mayor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/10/andrew-cuomo-resigns-as-governor-of-new-york/"&gt;resigned as &lt;/a&gt;governor in August 2021 after accusations of misconduct and under threat of impeachment — though he’s denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzopardi said Cuomo still believes congestion pricing is “ultimately the right policy” and that’s why he fought to approve it. But “the question is whether now is the right time to implement it,” the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing is premised on a safe and reliable subway system, and given the obvious lack of confidence the public currently has in the subway system – combined with the tenuous state of New York City post-COVID –  the Governor called for a data-driven study on the impact of congestion pricing to inform the timing of such a major policy change and to ensure New York was not creating additional obstacles to its comeback,” Azzopardi said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cuomo was responsible for muscling the first-in-the-nation congestion toll plan through New York’s legislature in 2019 to help fund mass transit and curb traffic in Manhattan’s central business district. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 10 murders in the subway this year, the highest homicide tally in 25 years. That figure includes the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/sebastian-zapeta-calil-charged-in-womans-burning-death-on-nyc-subway-often-bugged-out-after-smoking-k2-shelter-roommate/"&gt;horrifying arson murder &lt;/a&gt;of a sleeping straphanger on a train last week, allegedly at the hands of a sadistic illegal Guatemalan migrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rep for Hochul — who served as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor — fired back at her predecessor’s shifting stand and accused him of “gubernatorial mismanagement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Drivers upset about paying a $9 toll when entering Manhattan should remember two things: Andrew Cuomo is the reason they’re paying a toll, and Kathy Hochul is the reason it’s 40% lower than originally envisioned,” said Hochul spokesman Avi Small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul took office in 2021 — two years after congestion pricing became law — and got to work fixing the mess she inherited at the MTA following a decade of gubernatorial mismanagement,” Small added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hochul lowered the toll from $15 to 9 which takes effect Sunday, Jan. 5. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrew Schwartz / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toll opponents welcomed Cuomo’s change of heart, but noted the ex-governor is the one who put the issue front and center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s nice to see that now Cuomo recognizes what a bad idea congestion pricing is, but we won’t forget that he was the one who signed it into law just like the bail reform and sanctuary state policies that have made us less safe,” said.Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe he should have listened to Republicans before championing these disastrous policies,” added Malliotakis, who also challenged Hochul to ride the subway without her state police security detail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/05/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-considering-delaying-congestion-pricing-report/"&gt;originally tabled &lt;/a&gt;a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited till after the election to push a $9 commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority also has the authority to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/mta-could-hike-nyc-congestion-toll-by-25-on-gridlock-alert-days-in-surge-pricing-style-tax-squeeze/"&gt;raise the tolls &lt;/a&gt;by 25% on gridlock alert days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hochul, who largely controls the MTA, derailed &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/hochul-puts-brakes-on-congestion-tolls-extra-surge-pricing-squeeze-after-fierce-backlash/"&gt;the gridlock surcharge &lt;/a&gt;last week after an exclusive Post report about the outrageous add-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malliotakis and other congestion-pricing foes are appealing to President-elect Donald Trump, who opposes congestion pricing, to stop the toll, which was approved by the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s an avenue for President Trump to intervene and stop it,” Malliotakis said on 77 WABC radio’s the “Cats Roundtable” show Sunday. “[We] do have a lawsuit still in court, as does New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re still hopeful that we can stop this congestion pricing cash grab that will cost commuters thousands of dollars,” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/most-new-yorkers-loathe-kathy-hochuls-congestion-toll-eye-opening-poll-says/"&gt;majority of New Yorkers &lt;/a&gt;— 51% — oppose a congestion toll on Manhattan commuters, according to a recent Siena College poll. Only 29% of those polled said they were supportive of the congestion tax with another 20% saying they were unsure or were in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The toll is backed by transit advocates and environmental groups, the Regional Planning Association and  the Partnership for the City of New York, a top business advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of a board that doles out state charter-school licenses says Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature should lift the cap on the number of city charters next year so Big Apple students can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The charter licenses approved by lawmakers last year have already been doled out, which means no more of the schools can be approved in the Big Apple because of the cap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should focus more on kids — not politics,” said Joseph Belluck, chairman of the State University of New York committee that reviews and licenses charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are currently 282 charter schools serving nearly 150,000 students in the city.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lifting the cap will help us provide more slots to kids who need it,” said Belluck, whose group, along with the state Education Department, distributes the licenses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently 282 charter schools serving nearly 150,000 students in the city. The charters make up about 15% of publicly funded Big Apple schools. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The alternative, privately managed, publicly funded schools are popular with parents for their rigor but fiercely opposed by the teachers’ union and traditional public-school educators, who say the charters provide unwanted competition, draining them of students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most charter schools have a longer school day and school year than traditional public schools, and studies show their students &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/11/charter-schools-outperform-public-schools-in-us-with-ny-results-among-the-best-in-the-country-study/"&gt;outperform their peers &lt;/a&gt;on standardized math and English exams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“The cap should not only be lifted, but there should be no cap on opportunity,” insisted Eva Moskowitz, founder and CEO of Success Academy, which runs 56 charter schools. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of charter schools are also non-union, a point of contention in Big Labor New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cap should not only be lifted, but there should be no cap on opportunity,” insisted Eva Moskowitz, founder and CEO of Success Academy, which runs 56 charter schools, the largest charter network in the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All parents deserve a choice about where their kids go to school,” Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lester Long, founder and CEO of the Classical Charter Schools Network, said, “New York City needs great schools so more students can get a great education.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lifting the charter school cap is one prong in improving education in the city,” Long said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A New York school-choice and education-reform group also said it’s time for Albany to do what it considers best for parents and kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lester Long, founder and CEO of the Classical Charter Schools Network, said, “New York City needs great schools so more students can get a great education.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;South Bronx Classical Charter Schools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s long past time to treat students in charters fairly: they deserve equitable funding and access to rental assistance for their buildings” said Crystal McQueen-Taylor, executive director of StudentsFirstNY.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The artificial cap on great schools has also passed its expiration date. Parents and advocates will continue to fight for what our children deserve,” the charter proponent said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a cap of 460 charter schools statewide. But there is a subcap within that cap for New York City that restricts the opening of more charters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the law, there are 84 charters left to be issued outside of the city, where there is less demand. If Albany just eliminated the regional cap, New York City would have access to those 84 charters, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The head of a board that gives out state charter-school licenses says Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature should lift the cap on the number of city charters next year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Seth Harrison/The Journal News part of the USA TODAY NETWORK / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Hochul proposed lifting the cap in the five boroughs but was rebuffed by resistant lawmakers. The compromise was to allow the reissuance of 14 so-called “zombie” licenses from shuttered schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on Sunday claimed there is no public appetite to lift the charter-school cap in the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The charter cap was codified in order to strike the balance between offering some school choice and fulfilling the mandate to keep public schools open, and that balance is needed now more than ever,” said state Sen. John Liu (D-Queens), chairman of the panel on New York City Schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would be nonsensical to lift a statutory limit simply because it’s been reached,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State Assembly Education Committee Chairman Michael Benedetto (D-Bronx) said, “My chamber has always been resistant to charter schools. I don’t see a change happening right now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s office said the governor will lay out her education agenda when she submits her executive budget plan early next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul has made record investments in education, increasing school aid by $6.5 billion since taking office, and she will continue working with the Legislature to deliver high quality educational opportunities to New York students. The Governor will unveil her FY26 Budget this winter during the 2025 Legislative session,” a spokesperson for the governor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep spinning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bryant Park’s iconic carousel is back up and running two days after a fire &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/fire-erupts-at-bryant-parks-holiday-market-in-nyc/"&gt;tore through a nearby stall &lt;/a&gt;at the green space’s famed holiday market and shuttered several kiosks until further notice, workers told The Post on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bryant Park’s iconic holiday market is back up and running two days after a fire tore through one of its vendors’ stalls and shuttered several kiosks until further notice. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LP MEDIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 19-year-old carousel worker who only gave the initials KM estimated that the carousel ride, located steps away from where Friday’s fire erupted, lost thousands of dollars on the day of the blaze when it had to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The park attraction was back up and spinning the next day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to close for the day,” KM said. “I was coming into work that day, but then before I left my house, I got a message from my boss, and they were like, ‘Hey, there’s a fire. So you can’t come in to work today.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The raging fire at Seapark – a kiosk offering lobster rolls and seafood fries – was “accidental, caused by cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles,” the FDNY said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Provided by Matthew Lief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trinity Thompson, a stall worker at nearby Babka Bailout, said the fire clean-up effort “was just really fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fire department came [and] blew it out. And then I think two, three hours later, it was just cleaned up in the parking lot. It’s business as usual,” said Thompson, 24.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The employee she wasn’t working when the fire broke out about 9:20 a.m. She said the blaze didn’t have a big impact on Babka Bailout, which is near the Seapark seafood kiosk where the fire originated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The raging fire at a stall for Seapark – which offers lobster rolls and seafood fries – was “accidental, caused by cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles,” the FDNY said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blaze appeared to have started as a trash fire, sources told The Post, and then spread to the 6-foot-by-40-foot kiosk. The fire was placed under control by around 10 a.m., officials said later Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was slight damage to the adjacent kiosk, and there was some heat impingement on the roof of the ice-skating rink behind the kiosk on fire,” FDNY Chief of Battalion 9, Joe Castellano, told reporters at the time. “No real fire spread, just some flame impingement, and you see a little browning of the white roof structure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seapark is one of four kiosks that remain closed until further notice because of the blaze. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LP MEDIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the swift recovery effort, not all businesses seemed to get back up on their feet as quickly as others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seapark is one of four kiosks that remain closed until further notice, according to the vendor’s social media pages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiosks for Down the Chimney, Criollas and 4×4 Burger were also shuttered fornow, Seapark said. The holiday market is due to close its doors Jan. 5. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Firefighters battled the holiday market blaze at about 9:20 a.m. Friday. It was placed under control within the hour, officials said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My parents and I have worked so hard to keep this business going for the last few years, and we are now going to endure an extremely heavy lost [sic],” Seapark founders’ son Daniel Xie wrote in a GoFundMe post for the eatery, which amassed nearly half of its $9,000 goal in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most vendors told The Post their business hadn’t been affected by the blaze – and unaffected stalls were able to open starting later in the day Friday – KM reported the carousel’s workers weren’t paid for the day off. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m not too worried about the carousel making money, but … I did not get paid for not coming in that day,” KM said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of a bummer, but, you know, s–t happens,” he said. “But still, that kind of sucks, especially during the holidays – [not] being able to help out my family” with the extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s unclear what sparked the 2 a.m. argument at Bagel Depot on Richmond Avenue, but the hoodie-wearing suspect pulled out a knife to settle it, police sources told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two victims at the deli &amp;#8212; a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl &amp;#8212; had left the shop after the dispute and went to their Chesebrough Street house, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;img width="962" height="590" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/3854-richmond-ave-staten-island-95970479.jpg?w=1024" alt="The deli exterior" class="wp-image-34238851"&gt;A masked suspect argued with a pair of teens at this Staten Island deli, then followed them home and slashed them, cops said.  &lt;p class="credit"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the knife-wielding maniac followed them and pounced once they arrived at the residence, slashing the man on the right leg and cutting the girl&amp;#8217;s arm. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 14-year-old boy came out of the house during the dispute, and the suspect slashed him on the right knee, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;


	 



&lt;p&gt;Cops arrived after a 911 call and found the wounded trio, the NYPD said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Authorities brought them to Staten Island University North Hospital in stable condition. &lt;/p&gt;



 



&lt;p&gt;There haven&amp;#8217;t been any arrests, and the investigation is ongoing, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Long Island man fatally stabbed his mom on Christmas Eve while she made dinner at their Massapequa home, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Ramirez, 27, was booked Saturday in the horrific holiday slaying. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On this particular evening, it was just him and his mother at the house, Jeremy and his mom. Mom was making some food for dinner,” said Detective Sgt. Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Homicide Squad at a press briefing Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/long-island/long-island-mom-christmas-eve-stabbing/6087881/"&gt;NBC-TV News in New York reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

class="credit"&gt;NBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He stabbed her multiple times and is observed discarding the knife outside the premise,” Fitzpatrick said. “Unknown what provoked him to attack his mother, but based on his history and his violent nature, anything could have set him off to make him attack his mother like that.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramirez had just returned from a local laundromat when he flew into a rage at the home and repeatedly stabbed his mother — identified by cops as Josefina Ramirez Montero, 57 — in the chest and abdomen, according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pdcn.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=13742"&gt;Nassau County police said&lt;/a&gt; officers were dispatched to the home on Old Sunrise Highway and found the victim unresponsive in the living room. She was pronounced dead at the hospital, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her son has a criminal record dating to 2018, including busts for assault and weapons possession charged stemming from a bat assault on a victim, the outlet said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would argue that New York City is mired in a housing crisis — as defined by high prices and low vacancies. There’s good evidence for that conclusion. The most recent federal &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023%20NYCHVS%20Selected%20Initial%20Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported a vacancy rate of just 1.4%, “a stark contrast to the 4.54 rate in 2021”.  Over the same period, median monthly rent rose from $1,500 to $,1641 — and that includes everything from luxury high-rises to public housing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Maggie Brunn, president of Brooklyn’s A&amp;amp;E Real Estate, says rent-regulated apartments are languishing on the NYC market.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These sorts of figures drive an ongoing search for solutions to the problem — including, most recently, Mayor Adams’ Dec. 12 announcement of a new city &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/916-24/mayor-adams-new-charter-revision-commission-continue-important-work-tackling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charter Revision Commission&lt;/a&gt; to consider, as he put it, how to “deliver as much affordable housing to working-class New Yorkers and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A thorough examination of New York’s housing policy — both at the city and state level — could include a growing body of economic research regarding rent regulation, which affects the 960,000 “rent-stabilized” apartments whose price is set not by the market but by mayoral appointees. Rent stabilization may provide a good deal for those lucky to benefit from it. But as economists from across the political spectrum increasingly concur, it ultimately harms the city’s housing market for many.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into the impact of rent control has a long history. Back in 1997, the Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Erzo Luttner described the “misallocation of housing” that rent controls creates. That was their term for a mismatch between what renters might need and what they choose because the price is cheap — such as folks who might only need a small apartment, but live in a big one because they can afford it. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2018, the liberal &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt; cited the same problem: “Once a tenant has secured a rent-controlled apartment, he may not choose to move in the future and give up his rent control, even if his housing needs change.” This “misallocation,” Brookings continued, is not without major consequence, most notably “empty-nest households living in family-sized apartments and young families crammed into small studios.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023%20NYCHVS%20Selected%20Initial%20Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt; analysis of New York housing data suggests that’s exactly what is happening here  — as young people crammed into subdivided studios with multiple roommates know well.  The difference between rent-regulated and market-rate housing in the Big Apple is stark: Only 94,000 (24%) rent-stabilized tenants had moved (either in or out) in the past year, compared to 221,000 (57%) of market-rate tenants.  Rent-stabilized tenants are more likely to stay put — forming a kind of housing blockade for newcomers or households with kids who need more bedrooms. As per the Census, the long-term rent-stabilized tenants were not necessarily low-income: 30% reported incomes above $100,000 a year—in keeping with notorious &lt;a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2008/07/15/decoding-new-york-city-s-rent-stabilized-mysteries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; of the actress Mia Farrow and Congressman Charles Rangel enjoying rent-stabilized units. (Farrow inherited hers through her family, as the law permits.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Decades ago Harvard economistsEdward Glaeser spoke about the “misallocation” of housing created by rent regulations. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rent controls, notes the &lt;a&gt;Journal of Housing Economics&lt;/a&gt;, lead to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/redistribution-of-income" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;redistribution of income&lt;/a&gt; — which can include tenants who become better off at the expense of landlords. As Kenny Burgos, the former Bronx Assemblyman who now heads the New York Apartment Association (NYAA) — which represents the owners of some 400,000 regulated units — notes, the current system “inhibits the natural flow and movement of a normal housing market.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There can be ill-effects on housing quality too, economists are finding, in ways that harm rent-stabilized tenants themselves. In February, 2024,  ceonomists at the &lt;a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/feb/what-are-long-run-trade-offs-rent-control-policies#:~:text=Economists%20generally%20have%20found%20that,thereby%20exacerbating%20affordable%20housing%20shortages." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank&lt;/a&gt; looked at the physical effects of rent controls. They concluded that “while rent-control policies do restrict rents at more affordable rates, they can also lead to a reduction of rental stock and maintenance, thereby exacerbating affordable housing shortages.” Similarly, new research in the &lt;a href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272391/1-s2.0-S1051137723X00060/1-s2.0-S1051137724000020/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEPP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDKPidH7r8fPkDheUmre3fVkRrPyGsYOPEFT2WSmyp8NQIgZmZlLR3UhGhLrR7XUsFZFDKDHmIQL0X20tqxcQADbSkqvAUIrP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDM0I727SPxkryq8ErCqQBZRkRTsdKJPWTT%2FTmLSHVbVTZzIPBPlpTHDoHs1knZSc%2BW7DTd1iOTWn36Y32R8KYUt%2FY70AHQrdy3HjtKa1L3vJ57PWBZ5lwef2gdW%2BWQkhD9mD1IKcwCK%2BeClCZr5YD%2F6zZlm6kN%2Fh3KPo%2FO%2Fgcj6wD2jdnzFyivr5iiatntqW3Y1sU6VQmKxdy%2FbETac5Hrrbt0eHKbx9wyDMJfmEfQrjirtjGK7UieKWoQz9rU2SXZVvG8lR4jZ1V6hGU223gTWB2HM2msd65HnxTRhLVr7nWDXx5yNDwIAXXDBJEt0%2BkYj3FSLDkZ6BDC3vGIjfT8AjbAUi6ooV0mXKJK9GUdtIM%2BL8fIGZYmM%2B2%2B6zmlGPZsZGDsFtJ5khoTHx0879WYzAgmo2N2J6Q9d8bQJ1H9rk6DJu3AzdkCNbQ8RyVZx%2BOFplWHZwdvKgrX%2Fnhb3Wu7xFgeGoKrJu4XnuNqqfD37b7fH3J2vVR9gG45ZJNK71LQyy9Oe1%2FlYFraQK5fGR6KByi4awlJ0xrNuInDfiywgWat%2FwFwPPoBLmQ3flJKW7Z49002ETJkCN%2B6WytZQ4LwoESDoBp9wxtPLqU6fr8xS%2BS%2Bzzz7ZAvhq18S0DAa1iv2PDTi6XRUN5YB898ccSwusw8IsY4QEScLm4HxqU79%2Bse7Oi38htdVrbIiS3CkfXCfDyqkzo%2F2UXb40jJGmlEG4MrsE4H3czTYsEb92U9vKH4FiLJNnM55PBmU577Sag0oBKnDsCDrFVXCLdTVyBi7RP8ogKjUdtgBq71KBZ7cZKeVNujuh0Jfg1Rmjw1KluUTcuQCqa2hcXtYgZOk4dC1rM4uzwOTdZ4iHa439jnRFggvij%2BPOuXOdgilwsUubnMNO857oGOrEBy9zv96OqpezQ4Uy2Ti%2FvtmW%2FdOn0FYrqsU42G9kjfMB7enYQOkHTkzQ73zxPCdVP2N59aWLdYbHa4EQEp%2BSK%2FTp%2BdnoH0zXFxWHeexvN06hoQQOqsVuLGQqR3zk3Ih0d%2BG5medpTnwhv5hqMclNbT62QtCtj0kWNcpDvzos%2FVqjUIWQxLgP1xIhtBosQo95xY27a8PBz2xkqbYwW%2F5MKof9Bbu9qISZo7icLtmkmvuiM&amp;amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20241211T195001Z&amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYVODNFNCB%2F20241211%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=09419784741bf462c7c3d09c47cfc075876cf0d4b7e4c6411caed22fecc5b31b&amp;amp;hash=9cc03966255e232eeef47845ffc59c0912d31f42434586aad22a3a1acad26552&amp;amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;amp;pii=S1051137724000020&amp;amp;tid=spdf-6c1542a3-346c-4aaf-8003-c1831217065a&amp;amp;sid=a563577e7c8958456b88d1f-fc21f4bd8795gxrqa&amp;amp;type=cli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Housing Economics&lt;/a&gt; from March 2024 concluded that “even tenants in the controlled dwellings can suffer from rent control, as maintenance of such dwellings can be reduced, leading to a decreased housing quality.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Actor Mia Farrow is one of the many high-profile New Yorkers who famously live in a rent-regulated home. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Peterson / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, the most recent findings from New York reveal these very same market conditions. Its review of “reported housing problems” found that there are more tenant complaints about rodents, leaks, cracks and heating in rent-stabilized units than in the non-regulated. The numbers are striking: 376,000 reports of rodents in regulated units (39% of all), compared to 240,000 in market-rate units (22% of all).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The repair needs of older, rent-regulated buildings can even lead to owners simply abandoning them, as Maggie Brunn, president of Brooklyn’s A&amp;amp;E Real Estate, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/nyregion/how-to-fix-nyc-housing-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;. “When an apartment has been lived in for 20 or 30 years, those limits [on rent increases] don’t even come close to the actual costs of rewiring, plumbing and the basic improvements you’d need to rent an apartment that a family would be proud to call home. That means more and more of those desperately needed low-rent apartments are sitting vacant.” That problem has been exacerbated by 2019 &lt;a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/rent-stabilization-and-emergency-tenant-protection-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York state legislation&lt;/a&gt; which sharply limits rent increases even for rising costs such major capital repairs.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Argentine Pres. Javier Milei deregulated homes in the nation’s capitol, Buenos Aires. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Costantino/SOPA Images/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burgos of the NYAA estimates at&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/12/rent-control-in-nyc-could-become-the-new-abortion/"&gt; least 10,000 of such “ghost apartments” lie vacant&lt;/a&gt; — because their owners “aren’t allowed to recoup their costs. Inflation, property taxes, insurance.” As a result, he says, “banks won’t lend to them.”  That’s exactly what Brookings has found. “Rent control can also lead to decay of the rental housing stock; landlords may not invest in&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/#:~:text=Rent%20control%20can%20also%20lead%20to%20decay%20of%20the%20rental,offered%20potential%20benefits%20for%20tenants." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; maintenance because they can’t recoup these investment by raising rents.” &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The system,” says Burgos, “is not working either for owners or tenants.” But how could this deeply established system — existing, in one form or other, for more than 50 years — actually be adjusted?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Buenos Aires’ housing stock became more affordable as a result. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;jkraft5 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experience of another major world city, Buenos Aires, Argentina, suggests doing so might not bring on the chaos and price-gouging tenant advocates would suggest. Late last year, libertarian-leaning Argentine President Javier Milei simply “scrapped” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/argentina-milei-rent-control-free-market-5345c3d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rent controls, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;The effect, it reported, is that “the Argentine capital is undergoing a rental-market boom. Landlords are rushing to put their properties back on the market, with Buenos Aires rental supplies increasing by over 170%. While rents are still up in nominal terms, many renters are securing better (or at least fairer) deals, with a 40% decline in the real price of rental properties when adjusted for inflation.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply scrapping rent control like in Buenos Aires would be far more difficult in regulation-laden New York, of course. But, as Burgos notes, even permitting the de-regulation of vacant units could lead to significant improvement — without affecting current tenants.  What he calls “vacancy control” stands in the way of the rent increases owners need to invest simply to comply with building codes and lead abatement laws — rather than leaving units vacant. The city’s Charter Commission could help by reducing property taxes or water rates for regulated units. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luxury apartments such as these are generally exempt from rent regulations, which furthers the city’s housing imbalance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even a rapid deregulation might not be that consequential in much of the city.  Census survey reports that the typical market-rate rent ($2,000) is not fantastically higher than the typical regulated rent ($1,500). In The Bronx, the typical rent for all units — including non-rent stabilized — is just $1,200.  Market rents, in other words, can be close to regulated rents in lower-cost neighborhoods. Combined with a wave of vacant units coming back on the market and new investments, New York might follow (or at least tiptoe) in the footsteps of Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a move would not only benefit renters, it would save the city the expenses associated with an agency most metropolises don’t possess, the Rent Stabilization Guidelines Board, whose staff sets rent increase recommendations and monitors compliance. What’s more, property owners — including mom-and-pop landlords who own just a few buildings — would no longer have to incur the red tape headaches of registering their buildings every year — and either mailing or hand-delivering the required forms and fees, to be paid, for each unit, both to the state ($13) and the city ($20).  Failing to do so means a &lt;a href="https://rsanyc.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/February-2024_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;$500 fine — per apartment. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Efforts to roll back rent regulations were placed before the Supreme Court recently. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts, led by the owners’ lobby, the Rent Stabilization Association (now part of the New York Housing Association), to upend the price control regime through the courts — without success.  Most recently, the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-wont-hear-clash-over-new-york-rent-stabilization-laws-2024-11-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;US Supreme Court declined a challenge based&lt;/a&gt;, in part, on the argument that rent regulation was effectively a legal “taking of an owner’s property, without compensation.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that property owners sought to overturn rent regulation through the courts makes clear how difficult it is to change the system legislatively. But city and state officials should take notice of the changing leadership in Washington. In the first Trump Administration, a &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-HH14-PURL-gpo173032/pdf/GOVPUB-HH14-PURL-gpo173032.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;White House Executive Council&lt;/a&gt; singled out rent control for criticism, writing that it can lead to “restricted supply [which] ends up hurting some of the lower-income renters they are intended to help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To the chagrin of many landlords, the Supreme Court found rent regulation to be constitutional  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trump may take a less favorable view of rent rent regulations. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KEN BLEVINS/WILMINGTON STAR-NEWS / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York City’s budget relies on Washington for $100 billion in revenue, including from the Department of Housing and Urban Development — which could attach strings to that aid, including revisions to rent regulation or calling for it to end. Once back in office, Donald Trump — as he often does — could prove a wild card and deregulate New York City’s housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Angels will start patrolling New York City subway cars once again in response to the the horrifying murder of a sleeping passenger, who was burned to death on the F train last week, the group announced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ever since the horrifying incident, “hundreds of citizens” have requested the Guardian Angels return to patrol the subway cars, the group — which was founded in 1979 in response to sky-high subway crime — said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group’s latest strategy, outlined by founder Curtis Sliwa, will focus on conducting wellness checks on homeless people and emotionally disturbed individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was the “sunshine” of her office — until she asked for equal pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A News12 anchor claims her simple claim for equity resulted in such harsh blowback from her network that she had a psychotic break and ended up on suicide watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annalisa Klebers, &lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/news-12-networks-win-21-excellence-in-journalism-awards-from-connecticut-spj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an award-winning journalist&lt;/a&gt; who anchored the morning news for Altice USA-owned News12 stations in Connecticut and New Jersey, said the sudden change in her boss’ demeanor came  after she asked about a new contract with better pay than the $71,000 she’d been getting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Klebers spent six days on suicide watch. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What resulted, she claims, was months of being “gaslit” by supervisors, excluded from meetings, and having more and demeaning work piled on her — including fixing her co-anchor’s typos.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What management did to me changed my life forever. I almost lost my life. My children came very close to almost losing their mother,” she told The Post. “I felt like my whole world was caving in.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Klebers, a 42-year-old mother of three, was hired in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her supervisors praised her intelligence and work ethic, calling her the “sunshine of the newsroom,” according to a claim filed with the American Arbitration Association and obtained by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, she was frequently one of just two people in the building, responsible for everything from her own work to “making sure the cameras, lights, and teleprompter were working” and covering then-Gov. Cuomo’s daily news conferences, according to the claim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The efforts earned her yet more praise and a $4,200 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Klebers, a 42-year-old mother of three, was hired in April 2018. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But co-workers were getting double that amount, she learned. And when she voiced concerns to her managers, the sun began to set on her career at the station, Klebers contended in papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I felt humiliated,” she said. “I was being alienated from the rest of the news team. Management began blaming technical difficulties on me that I had no control over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I did everything managers asked of me and more,” she added. “This all while my contract and pay raise were being held over my head. It felt like management wanted me to quit or react poorly to the things they were doing to me.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Her supervisors praised her intelligence and work ethic, calling her the “sunshine of the newsroom.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was cut out of a promotional advertisement featuring storm coverage she helmed — while a male colleague who called out that day was edited into the footage, she claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klebers put in a formal complaint but then ultimately decided to resign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Altice refused to accept her departure, ostensibly because the company claimed it was required to investigate her complaint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It all sent me into a spiral,” she said. “It was too much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The former anchor alleges she was “gaslit” by management.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On Friday, May 13, 2022, I became very ill,” Klebers said. “I had a psychotic break. I was suicidal. This all happened in front of my husband and children and even my sister.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her husband Erik said “she became almost catatonic, staring into space, moving around the house inexplicably.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She kept trying to grab her car keys and heading to the garage, Erik Klebers said, which doctors later confirmed was her attempt at suicide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She spent six days in the psych ward on suicide watch. She was later fired by Altice while out on disability.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;News12 co-anchors Rick Holmes and Annalisa Klebers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her career was completely derailed, such to the point that she does not see any avenue back to an anchor desk, not at News12 or any media, any newsroom anywhere,” said her attorney, Anthony Mango. “This was brought about by her just making in good faith, raising an issue for the equal pay. “It’s really rendered her disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klebers wants the American Arbitration Association to award her the income she would have made as an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She chose to go public because “this cannot happen to another person, woman or man, that works in a corporate environment. It should be criminal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An Altice USA spokesperson said, “News 12 prides itself on providing an inclusive and equitable workplace where employees can thrive and are compensated based on their skills, contributions, and merit; any gender discrimination claims are entirely baseless, and we will defend against them vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man was gunned down in Hell’s Kitchen on Saturday after arguing with a rival, cops and witnesses said — as crime continues to rise in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharief Jackson was blasted twice in the chest shortly before 3 am inside his apartment on 49th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues, according to the NYPD and residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police found him in front of the 5-story building bleeding out and conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medics rushed him to NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue but he could not be saved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His killer was still on the loose Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A resident told The Post she heard yelling before three gunshots rang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold-blooded killing comes as murder surged by 66.7% this year compared to 2023 in Midtown North Precinct, with five homicides recorded through Dec. 15, according to NYPD &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-018pct.pdf"&gt;crime stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robberies, assaults, rape and burglaries are also up, leaving locals rattled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived here for years,” said 67-year-old Thomas Kurilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It got really nice. It got gentrified and then it’s back to 1980s all over again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A resident leaving Jackson’s building — which was wrapped in crime scene tape hours after the murder — echoed those sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a scary time around Hell’s Kitchen. It’s unfortunate to see the direction it’s gone. I hope it gets better. This street used to be better,” he said, adding he was headed to Australia for vacation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It couldn’t be a better time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Hechtman, a beloved and irascible New York Post editor who spent more than four decades at the tabloid, died Friday from lymphoma. He was 82. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The veteran newsman died in his sleep at Methodist Home for Nursing and Rehabilitation in the Bronx, according to his longtime friend, Shelagh Masline.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A night editor with a gallows humor and penchant for belting out Sondheim tunes, Hechtman mentored generations of reporters at The Post, giving scores of young journalists their first break, former colleagues and proteges said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman passed away in his sleep at Methodist Home for Nursing and Rehabilitation in the Bronx. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would have nothing without Mike — I would not have been a reporter,” said former Post journo Jennifer Fermino.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hechtman infamously would have cub reporters sit beside him at his desk, where he would tear their stories to shreds to teach them how to write for the tabloid. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“One of the first things he would do is create a huge gap, six to seven spaces between your byline and what was your lede, because you were going to start over again,” said former Post reporter and Metro Editor Eric Lenkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman was infamously known for mentoring young reporters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook Candace Amos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman, he added,  “gave everyone a shot” at the paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Jay Hechtman was born in Brooklyn on April 5, 1942, to Henry Hechtman, a hat factory owner in the Garment District, and Rose Sass, a homemaker. His family soon moved to Rego Park, Queens, where he later would live for decades in a studio apartment without a stove. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He studied journalism at Brooklyn College, where he worked on the school newspaper, and later received a graduate degree from the University of Michigan, according to Masline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman was born in Brooklyn in 1942. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Annie Wermiel/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served in the US Army Reserves, where he handled writing press releases at Fort Dix in New Jersey, according to copy editor Milton Goldstein. He was honorably discharged in 1971. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following reporting stints at the Hartford Courant and the Associated Press, Hechtman joined The Post in 1974 as a reporter, and soon cemented his status as “super rewrite man” — transforming street reporters’ harried notes into seamless prose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The night that [Yankees catcher] Thurman Munson died in the plane crash in the late 70s, [Post Publisher Rupert] Murdoch said I want your best man on this story,” former city editor Dick Belsky recalled. “Without hesitation we gave it to Hechtman.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman previously served in the US Army Reserves, being honorably discharged in 1971.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook Candace Amos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a night editor, Hechtman gained notoriety for his tendency to wake up reporters with zero qualms at 2 a.m. to answer questions about their stories. He also had an uncanny ability to trim overwritten stories to their tabloid essence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He could take a 20-paragraph story and turn it into a haiku, that’s how good he was,” recalled former Post reporter Cynthia Fagen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His newsroom eccentricities included regular bathroom announcements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman joined The Post in 1974.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He had this routine at night where he’d go to the bathroom and announce to the newsroom, ‘If Madonna calls for me, I’m in the middle stall,’ ‘If the Pope calls for me, I’m in the middle stall,'” Belsky recalled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fermino recalled Hechtman kept of collection of headlines that were “too rude” to go in the paper. And he once  rewrote the lyrics of “Oklahoma!” to be about the Jewish new year: “Rosh Hashana, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains / and the matzoh ball stands proud and tall / we know we belong to the shul / and the shul we belong to is cool / and when we say vey, oy vey oy vey oy vey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;His newsroom eccentricities included regular bathroom announcements. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman was passionate about the New York City transit system – and cats, combining his two loves by naming his many feline companions over the years after the city’s various rail systems and companies, including “BMT” for the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corp. and “Metro-North.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He got his pilot’s license around 1979 following a trip to the South Pacific, and for a decade would fly friends and colleagues on a twin-engine Cessna for getaways to Newport and Martha’s Vineyard, Masline said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;After retiring from The Post in 2014, Hechtman returned to edit part-time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After retiring in 2014, Hechtman returned to edit part-time at The Post, where he wrote the column “Weird But True.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mike was New York City,” said former Post scribe Linda Massarella. “The five boroughs were like his own fingerprints — he just knew every inch of it — and as a new reporter, it was awesome to prowl the streets knowing the best editor on the planet had my back.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman, who battled dementia for the past five years, had no living relatives but is survived by Masline and her daughter Cailtin as well as her daughter’s fiancé Eddie Wooden, Masline said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman battled dementia for the past five years. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Annie Wermiel/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 letter to Masline, he asked her to inform The Post’s editors that they should not print an obituary for him when he dies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; claimsA P.J. Clarke’s general manager sexually harassed and assaulted a bartender, and even tried to convince her to ditch her hubby in a sick bid to “ruin” the woman’s marriage, according to a new lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amber Daza, 31, was subjected to “unwelcome sexual advances” by her supervisor, Kairsten Nunn, at the  Lincoln Square location of the famous, century-old bar and grill starting in April, according to the Manhattan federal court filing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn allegedly visited Daza’s apartment, insisted on staying overnight, and told Daza she might not “be able to control herself” if she slept over.&lt;/p&gt;

Clarke’s, according to a lawsuit. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram @amberlee_nyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn said she could give Daza better bartending shifts to make more money and “be near her more often,” according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mother’s Day, Nunn sent Daza $30 so she could get a gift for her mom — which Daza says she immediately sent back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During what was supposed to be a work meeting in May, Nunn allegedly showed up drunk and made sexual advances toward Daza. She suggested Daza might need to “move on” from her husband and asked if she had ever “been with” a woman before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn then grabbed Daza’s neck and tried to kiss her, leaving a bruise, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Daza did not reciprocate the advances, said she was uncomfortable, asked Nunn to be respectful and told her to stop, according to the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next day, Nunn allegedly sent Daza apology texts, saying, “That was not me, it was the liquor” and “I f–ked up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza filed a police report in June and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint in July, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza says she was retaliated against with less desirable shifts and had tips kept from her after the filed the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleagues told Daza that Nunn said she wanted to “ruin” Daza’s marriage, the suit charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The filing also alleges Nunn had sexual relationships with other subordinates and offered them scheduling benefits and “favorable conditions” in exchange for sex, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human resources and Daza’s managers knew about the alleged harassment but did nothing about it, according to the suit, which names Nunn, P.J. Clarke’s Lincoln Square and its management company, SLH Management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza is seeking unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn eventually resigned — it is not clear exactly when — but P.J. Clarke’s “delayed meaningful intervention” and fostered a “hostile work environment” in the meantime, subjecting Daza and others to continued harassment, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the parties did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Queens public high-school teacher created a creepy “escape room” where he allegedly sexually abused a female student, according to a troubling new report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scott Biski, a music teacher at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, also invited the girl to his home — calling it “the bat cave” — for sex when his wife and two kids were not home, investigators allege.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski, 50, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/nyc-teacher-accused-of-grooming-sexually-assaulting-student-for-years-then-sued-doe-for-not-funding-his-defense/"&gt;began “grooming” the student&lt;/a&gt; when she was 14, a sophomore, and it culminated when she was a senior into “a sexual relationship,”&lt;a href="https://nycsci.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Biski-20225144_redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; charges a report &lt;/a&gt;by the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Students allegedly hung out with music teacher Scott Biski in his classroom-office, which was transformed into a creepy “escape room” with old desks and file cabinets. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;biskisan/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I now understand that these weird hugs, embraces were actually just groping,” the now 25-year-old ex-student told investigators in 2022. “He was touching me for sexual pleasure without my consent.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biski arranged “makeshift dividers and old desks” in his music classroom and office, inviting students to hang out in his “escape room.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There, Biski touched the student’s breasts and tried to kiss her, prompting the girl to pull away and “promptly” leave, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Biski would also invite the girl to his home to play board games with other kids. Once, she arrived to find she was the only student there, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski also gave the girl lavish gifts, such as a flute that was only supposed to be lent to students, his favorite childhood book, new clothes and cash, including $200 for Ugg boots, it says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SCI found that he messaged the teen nearly 700 times, 82 times during school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski told the girl to save his number under a fake name – “Arthur Dent” — “so as to not arouse suspicion,” she told investigators.  Another student told SCI he believed the alias was “Harvey Dent,” a Batman villain whose alter ego was “Two-Face.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biski resigned from his post at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, but wasn’t charged criminally. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski forcibly kissed and groped the student in his school office and forced her to touch his erection, telling her, “That’s how you make me feel,” according to court documents and the SCI report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski assigned the student to play lead flute in the school band, gave her coveted solos and wrote “outstanding” college recommendation letters for her, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These were things he did as a part of his grooming process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once she graduated, she told investigators, Biski would allegedly “pester” her into coming to his house when his wife and two kids were gone to engage in sex acts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the perverted texts continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No Halloween party? No slut outfit?” he texted her during her first year in college. “No ‘I’m little red riding hood the whore.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, he wrote, “I have risked everything for you. My job. My home. My kids. Everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The student told investigators she was “disgusted” by his behavior because she saw Biski as a “father figure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biski gave the girl lavish gifts and messaged her nearly 700 times, according to investigators. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;biskisan/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD closed a criminal case against Biski because the student said the sexual contact was consensual and occurred after she turned 17, but the teacher’s behavior was “egregious, manipulative, and predatory,” the SCI charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the student came forward in June 2022, the city Department of Education &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/25/back-to-back-sex-misconduct-cases-upset-queens-high-school/"&gt;removed Biski from Gateway,&lt;/a&gt; but he remained on the city payroll until last year, collecting $99,578 in fiscal year 2024, records show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has “irrevocably resigned,” a DOE spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides recommending Biski’s termination, SCI called on the DOE to amend its guidelines on teachers using private phone numbers to text kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SCI has&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/11/us-news/schools-watchdog-begs-doe-to-ban-teacher-student-texting/"&gt; repeatedly urged the DOE&lt;/a&gt; to ban employees from contacting students’ cell phones and social media accounts. In the past five years, it has found at least 89 cases of DOE employees having inappropriate conversations with students via text and online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, the 25-year-old former student filed a lawsuit, charging Biski with harassment and sexual assault. In June, Biski sued the DOE for denying him legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Biski did not respond to inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homeless man &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/man-56-burned-inside-nycs-penn-station-cops-probing-cause-of-injuries/"&gt;who sustained burns to both legs and his upper body&lt;/a&gt; after catching fire inside Penn Station late Friday is now believed to have set himself ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police and MTA sources told The Post on Saturday there is no evidence that a second person was involved in the shocking incident. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD officers investigate the scene where a man was found on fire Friday night. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Officers from the NYPD search the secluded tunnel for clues after a man was found on fire. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The station was cordoned off to commuters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 67-year-old man, who police have yet to identify, was found on fire by first responders at around 8 p.m. in a secluded tunnel not far from New Jersey Transit Tracks 11 and 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was rushed to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in stable condition. On Saturday, medical personnel upgraded him to critical.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The victim told police he awoke to find he was on fire, and claimed the blaze was set by someone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the fire began, but no criminality appears to be involved, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident had commuters nevertheless shaken, with crime underground on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Portions of Penn Station were blocked off from commuters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The man was found by first responders in a tunnel near NJ Transit Tracks 11 and 12. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Friday’s shocking incident unfolded just days after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/"&gt;a still-unidentified woman was torched to death&lt;/a&gt; while sleeping on an F train in Brooklyn on Dec. 23.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s crazy,” commented Mike Jones, 28, a school safety officer from the Bronx who commutes to Penn Station. “I come through this area sometimes. It’s dangerous. It’s scary. Two people on fire, two different stations, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/victim-who-was-stabbed-in-the-throat-by-a-maniac-at-grand-central-station-says-no-one-came-to-her-aid-just-froze/"&gt;two stabbed at Grand Central Station&lt;/a&gt; — that’s dreadful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashley Cole, from Brooklyn, said he’s disgusted by the crime on the subways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fire fighters were summoned to the scene as well. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s completely safe [underground], but I’m not afraid,” the 75-year-old Cole said. “I try to pay attention to my surroundings, and I’m very sorry about what’s happening. I don’t know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Homeless individuals inside Penn Station told The Post many of them carry matches and lighters, as many smoke crack or synthetic marijuana, like K2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The woman’s arson murder was caught on surveillance video. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murder and arson charges in the F train incident have been filed against &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/suspect-accused-of-setting-nyc-subway-rider-on-fire-arrested/"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta&lt;/a&gt;, a Guatemalan migrant who had been deported in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers and tourists &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/new-years-eve-ball-unveiled-with-whopping-2688-new-sparking-crystals/"&gt;gathered in Times Square &lt;/a&gt;Saturday to bid “Good Riddance” to bedbugs, belly weight, loud neighbors and feelings for former lovers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 100 people showed up for the 18th annual event — each jotting down and symbolically erasing the grievances they wish to leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For 13-year-old Mason Riddle of Hartselle, Ala., &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/woman-who-wrote-new-years-wish-on-times-square-confetti-in-nyc-reveals-dream-came-true/"&gt;starting the new year with a clean slate&lt;/a&gt; means no more “arguing with my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do it all the time and she’s tired of it,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hundreds celebrated “Good Riddance Day” in Times Square to let go of their grievances for the new year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mom, Jessica Riddle, didn’t see their squabbles severe enough to wipe away on her own miniature chalkboard that the Times Square Alliance doled out. Instead, the single mom of two hopes to get rid of self-doubt and disorganization.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I question myself every day if I’m raising them the right way and I just want to enjoy life and have fun and stop stressing so much,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get a better handle on being organized so things move smoothly in our life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anna Daratany, 57, of Coney Island is bidding goodbye to the hormonal tribulations that accompany menopause — particularly belly weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Georgina Calvillo of Mexico is letting go of feelings for her ex-boyfriend. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The journey has been crazy. It’s been about four years. … You make it, I’ve been through it,” she said with a flourish of positivity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daratany is trying to drop weight and “get on with my golden years,” she said, adding she’d like to lose about 15 pounds: “I know it’s because of the hormones. I know it is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eileen Mullin, 57, of Rego Park is looking forward to standing her ground more in 2025 and not giving in to the demands of others, while new New Yorker Georgina Calvillo, 25, is saying goodbye to a recent heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He wanted to start a family in Mexico but I wanted to see the world here in New York so we decided to break up,” said Calvillo, who is working in the Big Apple as a nanny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 100 people packed into the tourist center Saturday, perhaps none had more to look forward to than Lauren of Williamsburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 29-year-old is saying good riddance to bedbugs, loud neighbors, a bad job and sad feelings in general. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The annual event encourages participants to jot down and symbolically erase the grievances they wish to leave behind this year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“When we reflect on the past, we look to say goodbye to things and good riddance to things,” said Tom Harris of the Times Square Alliance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For the first time this year, some Good Riddance Day messages were displayed on a Times Square billboard. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I live above a really loud pizza shop and it vibrated my floor for a month and a half,” said Lauren, who declined to share her last name, adding that she also suffered from bedbugs after accidentally bringing the pests home from a trip to Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was awful. I had to pack all my stuff up. It was packed up for a month and a half. I was scared to be around people because I didn’t want to give people bedbugs,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a whole thing and during that I was job interviewing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lauren of Williamsburg said she’s already off to a fresh start just a few days out from the new year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Lauren has already turned the page and is enjoying a fresh start — the bedbugs were exterminated on the same day she negotiated a deal with her neighbors to bring down the noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This all changed for me on the same day pretty much. It was my birthday. I got a job offer and I was unpacking from the bed bugs,” Lauren said triumphantly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good Riddance Day is one of several end-of-year events being celebrated in Times Square this weekend ahead of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/lifestyle/nyc-applebees-times-square-new-years-eve-ball-drop-tickets-got-pricier/"&gt;the iconic New Year’s Eve ball drop.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance, a typical list over the years includes money problems, cancer and bad boyfriends. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we reflect on the past, we look to say goodbye to things and good riddance to things,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today is a way to very publicly say good riddance to something in Times Square.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daughter of former Rep. Carolyn Maloney is riding her mother’s coattails in a “shameless” bid to reclaim the 78-year-old Democrat’s old City Council seat, insiders told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virginia Maloney, a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginiamaloney/"&gt;product manager&lt;/a&gt; at Meta, has flaunted her political pedigree in campaign material to potential voters since announcing her bid last month to replace term-limited Democratic Councilman Keith Powers, whose district comprises much of the Upper East Side and Midtown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On her campaign website, the 37-year-old UES native &lt;a href="https://virginiamaloney.com/issues/"&gt;lays out her concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the need for more affordable housing, combating extremism and improving healthcare access — but also leans into family lore of her mother going into labor with her while debating legislation on the City Council floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Insiders said Virginia Maloney, the daughter of former Rep. Carolyn Maloney, is riding her mother’s coattails in a bid for the 78-year-old Democrat’s former City Council seat. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mother — a teacher, City Councilwoman and Member of Congress — taught me to believe in myself as a woman and that when I do, I can get great things done,” the website &lt;a href="https://virginiamaloney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new 30-second &lt;a href="https://x.com/vmmaloney/status/1871247749502599458"&gt;introductory campaign ad&lt;/a&gt;, which briefly touched on Virginia Maloney’s work for the city Economic Development Corp. and later the private tech sector, was similarly ham-fisted in touting the candidate’s lineage, lingering on a clear, striking portrait of her mother as she reminded people that she’s “the daughter of two public servants.” Her late father, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2009/09/27/peak-tragedy-for-maloney/"&gt;Clifton Maloney&lt;/a&gt;, was a former US Navy vet and investment banker.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The elder Maloney, who &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD2OCEuNC6a/"&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDpvR8IyxWn/?img_index=1"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB_sOUeugGS/?img_index=1"&gt;in Instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCSsn9ayA0K/?img_index=1"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on Virginia Maloney’s campaign account, also is being trotted out as a host for her daughter’s campaign fundraisers both &lt;a href="https://contribute.nycvotes.org/campaigns/virginiamaloney/events/2245/contributions/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in Washington DC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://contribute.nycvotes.org/campaigns/virginiamaloney/events/2244/contributions/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Big Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most candidates I’ve worked with who have that sort of dynasty are never this shameless,” one veteran Democratic strategist told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a time and a place to evoke your mom, but from Day One, in such an aggressive way, strikes me as obscenely lazy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 30-second introductory campaign ad foisted upon viewers a photo of the elder Maloney while touting Virginia as being the daughter of public servants. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FaceBook Virginia Maloney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/VSApps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2909&amp;amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;amp;cand_name=Maloney,%20Virginia&amp;amp;office=CD%2004&amp;amp;report=summ"&gt;campaign filings&lt;/a&gt; in October, Virginia Maloney had yet to document any contributions, according to campaign records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second Democratic strategist, meanwhile, suggested Virginia Maloney’s bid for City Council is ultimately a “proxy” for her mother to eventually reclaim her old congressional seat after being trounced by fellow Manhattan Rep. Jerry Nadler in the bitter 2022 Democratic House primary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Carolyn Maloney has been as visible at events, if not more, than the candidate,” the insider said. “Everyone knows she wants her seat back.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Maloney, who had an estimated net &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/carolyn-maloney/net-worth?cid=N00000078"&gt;worth of $13 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, previously held the City Council District 4 seat representing the Upper East Side from 1982 to 1992. Virginia attended the posh Spence School, where &lt;a href="https://www.spenceschool.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tuition&lt;/a&gt; is an eye-watering $65,846 a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The elder Maloney became a totemic figure on the Upper East Side while representing the neighborhood in Congress.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Maloney went on to represent the nabe in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-maloney-ab940189/"&gt;Congress for another two decades&lt;/a&gt;, where she became a totemic figure in her district for her dogged advocacy to secure funding for the $4.4 billion 2nd Avenue subway line as well as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/former-rep-carolyn-maloney-honored-for-9-11-work-at-us-capitol-with-portrait-of-her-in-firefighter-jacket/"&gt;billions to finance&lt;/a&gt; health programs for 9/11 first responders and the victim’s compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Virginia is lucky to have learned a lot from her mother’s trailblazing career and she will use those lessons to serve her community and the City she loves so much,” said Shelby Garner, a campaign spokesman for Virginia Maloney and her mother’s former district chief of staff. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Maloney name is a “great name that fits the district,” the family legacy will only take her so far in what is shaping up to be a sharply competitive race, warned Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York’s Finest suffered a startling 4,600 injuries at the hands of violent suspects in the first nine months of 2024 – the most since the NYPD started keeping such statistics in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The frightening figure is 13% higher than the 4,077 officer injuries sustained citywide during the same period in 2023, and a whopping 60% higher than the 2,886 logged at that point in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between April and June, 1,640 on- and off-duty cops were hurt by perps – the highest number ever recorded in a single quarter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One top cop blamed the NYPD Bruise on the influx of more than 58,000 migrant criminals into the Big Apple. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fergregory – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the next three months were almost as bad, with 1,618 officer injuries, the second-most on record. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of officer injuries in the first three quarters of 2024 — 4,285 — were minor, but 192 were considered “substantial” and required treatment at a hospital, and 123 were seen as “serious” enough to warrant hospital admission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One top cop blamed the NYPD Bruise on the influx of more than 58,000 migrant criminals into the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“When the laws dictate that there are no meaningful consequences to assaulting police officers and we are housing that very same criminal element free of charge, of course there will be many more interactions with the very same violent individuals we couldn’t prosecute or deport,” SBA President Vincent Vallelong told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/feds-raid-migrant-tren-de-aragua-gang-house-in-nyc-after-tracking-gps-ankle-monitor-to-hideout/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;notorious gang that is poisoning our city&lt;/a&gt; and they are given free passes, jeopardizing the lives of our law enforcement officers and compromising public safety,” he continued, referring to the Venezuelan outlaws known as Tren de Aragua.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot more migrants [assault cops] than regular citizens,” said one officer with more than two decades on the job. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“A lot more migrants [assault cops] than regular citizens,” said one cop with more than two decades on the job.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of last month,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/30/us-news/nyc-is-now-home-to-over-58k-criminal-migrants-including-over-1000-gang-members-ice/"&gt; nearly 8% of the 759,218 illegal migrants&lt;/a&gt; living in New York City were either previously convicted of crimes or had criminal charges pending, according to jaw-dropping ICE data exposed by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one particularly ugly, migrant-fueled incident, two groups of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/us-news/migrants-batter-bite-nypd-cops-at-roosevelt-hotel/"&gt;brawling illegals ganged up on a pair of officers&lt;/a&gt; who arrived to break up a May 19 fight inside of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One officer was bitten in his left arm and bruised on his left leg. Another suffered injuries to his head, right elbow and wrist. One of the heartless assailants even tried to steal an officer’s hat as a trophy, police sources said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both cops were taken to the hospital in stable condition, and four migrants were arrested – three of whom had rap sheets prior to the incident, according to sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;On May 19, two groups of brawling migrants ganged up on a pair of officers who arrived to break up a fight inside of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last month, a 33-year-old migrant from Mexico was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/migrant-attacks-nypd-cops-who-intervene-in-street-brawl-sources/"&gt;busted for attacking two cops&lt;/a&gt; while they tried to cuff him for a street brawl in Elmhurst, Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mauricio David Sosa, who had just punched another man in the face, slugged one cop in the face and kicked another in the lower stomach when they went to arrest him, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sosa was later charged with two counts of felony assault and resisting arrest, police said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mexican national Mauricio David Sosa slugged one cop in the face and kicked another in the lower stomach last month, according to authorities.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 27, as many as 14 migrants joined in a&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/30/metro/cops-beaten-by-rowdy-migrant-mob-in-caught-on-video-assault-near-times-square-and-suspects-later-freed-without-bail/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt; vicious, caught-on-camera beating of two police officers&lt;/a&gt; in Times Square. Only one of the suspects was ever jailed, while five were charged but let go without bail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a week later, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/08/metro/7-migrants-now-indicted-in-attack-of-nypd-officers-in-times-square-after-being-freed-without-bail/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;announced he had indicted seven of the alleged attackers&lt;/a&gt;, but authorities at the time said they had all already fled to California. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond violent migrants, critics cited bail reform and soft-on-crime prosecutors like Bragg for the surge in cop assaults. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The de-carceral approach taken by both district attorneys and judges toward perpetrators who assault police officers is the main driver behind this ever-increasing rise in assaults…The public sees no one is going to jail for it, so it’s ‘I can do what I want,’ ” said NYPD Lt. John Macari.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD bodycam video shows the suspects charged with assaulting two police officers in Times Square on Jan. 27.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Manhattan District Attorney's Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shoplifters, drug dealers, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/us-news/nypd-agitator-allegedly-tossed-flaming-hat-at-cops-nyc-home-during-protest/"&gt;protestors&lt;/a&gt;, and migrants have no fear of putting their hands on anyone – including the police,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Far too many routine calls are turning into all-out brawls, and the reason is obvious: our justice system keeps releasing the same violent, repeat offenders, and they keep attacking cops when we try to lock them up again,” agreed Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Repeat criminal Ernst Delma was on probation Aug. 8 when he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/female-nypd-cop-punched-in-face-leading-to-wild-caught-on-camera-arrest/"&gt;viciously punched rookie officer Mary Fay&lt;/a&gt; to the ground in the Soundview neighborhood of The Bronx, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Video taken moments after the clobbering shows blood streaming down Fay’s face as a bystander helps her up off the sidewalk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video taken moments after the clobbering – which occurred after Fay tried to break up an argument between Delma, 41, and a group of kids – shows&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/10/us-news/female-nypd-cop-has-long-road-to-recovery-after-being-struck-by-parolee-union-boss/"&gt; blood streaming down the officer’s face&lt;/a&gt; as a bystander helps her up off the sidewalk. Other cops pounced on Delma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fay sustained a cut to her lip and was taken to a local hospital in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delma, who was on probation for a New Jersey conviction at the time, had numerous prior arrests for assault and burglary over the past several years – including a random slugging of a 57-year-old woman in Midtown in July 2022, police sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brute was charged with assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 19, career criminal Gary Worthy was stopped by cops after robbing a Jamaica, Queens smoke shop at gunpoint. Worthy, 57, turned and fired at officers, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/lifetime-parolee-who-shot-nyc-cop-was-cut-loose-by-judge-despite-das-pleas-multiple-arrests/"&gt;striking veteran officer Rich Wong in the thigh&lt;/a&gt;. The wounded hero cop fired back, hitting Worthy in the face and killing him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wong was transported to Jamaica Hospital and released the next morning as more than 200 NYPD cops cheered him on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worthy was already on lifetime parole and had served two stints in state prison before the fatal incident. Just a couple of months earlier, a Queens judge had cut Worthy loose on despite pleas from the Queens District Attorney’s Office to set bail  on a pair of cases for assault and burglary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between August and September, cops from the NYPD’s 46th Precinct suffered the most injuries – 51 – out of all 78 precincts citywide, according to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/11/metro/assaults-on-nypd-cops-have-escalated-to-record-breaking-totals-in-latest-show-of-anti-police-sentiment-full-blown-epidemic/"&gt;“Use of Force” data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Career criminal Gary Worthy shot veteran officer Rich Wong in the thigh on Nov. 19.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kyle Mazza/SOPA Images/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The 46 is one of the more violent commands, and these perps just feel like there’s no consequences,” explained the cop with 20 years on the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stats also show an eye-popping 29% surge in subject injuries in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year, with 4,515 this year compared to 3,497 in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was a 20% increase in the number of interactions between cops and perps where at least one party was injured in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An off-duty New York City cop has been arrested for allegedly raping and strangling someone close to him, sources told The Post Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Samuel Sierra, 35, was arrested around 7:20 p.m. Friday night in East Harlem and charged with first-degree rape, second-degree strangulation and third-degree assault, police confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack was “domestic in nature.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He allegedly attacked a family member or a partner, according to a source who wouldn’t disclose additional details of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sierra was expected to be arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court. He was suspended without pay pending trial.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;He joined the NYPD in 2016 and earned $167,584 last year, &lt;a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/k397-673e/visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;city records show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sierra has spent much of his career patrolling the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn, but in December 2023 he was transferred to the Auxiliary Police Section, where he oversees auxiliary cops, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.50-a.org/officer/UJ8T" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;50-a.org website&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks NYPD complaints and discipline of cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his successful 2021 campaign for mayor, Eric Adams famously declared himself the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/11/nycs-new-mayor-calls-911-brawl-slides-down-fire-pole-faces-big-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“future of the Democratic Party.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But heading into 2025, that future is in doubt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be a make-or-break year both politically and personally for the indicted Adams, who faces &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/mayor-adams-flashes-thumbs-up-as-he-passes-hecklers-on-return-to-court-resign/"&gt;bombshell federal corruption charges&lt;/a&gt; and a tough re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing a make-or-break year both politically and professionally in 2025, with federal corruption charges and a tough re-election bid among his toughest obstacles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams’ approval ratings sunk to a staggering 26% last month with 69% of New Yorkers saying he should resign – and 80% of fellow Democrats thinking he shouldn’t run for a second term in 2025, &lt;a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-indictment-of-eric-adams-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according a Marist Poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some aren’t counting out the former cop just yet.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“New Yorkers really care about strengthening our economy, lowering crime and having a more livable city, and Mayor Adams has delivered major wins on all those fronts,” said Brooklyn Democratic Party Boss Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at some of the challenges Hizzoner faces in 2025:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal Corruption Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams in September became the first sitting mayor in NYC’s history to be charged with federal crimes, indicted for allegedly taking bribes and illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Adams arriving in Manhattan federal court in November where he is facing public corruption charges. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pled not guilty, vowed to remain in office, and is scheduled to stand trial in April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowded Dem field &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centrist mayor faces a tough primary in June with a number of prominent leftist Dems, including  Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, Queens Sen. Jessica Ramos and Brooklyn Sen. Zellnor Myrie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seriously considering running for mayor in 2025.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His biggest challenge could come from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a fellow centrist who resigned in 2021 in the wake of a sexual misconduct scandal &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/28/us-news/cuomo-telling-nyc-powerbrokers-hes-running-for-mayor-if-special-election-is-called-sources/"&gt;but is mounting a political comeback.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC’s migrant crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Adams administration has been stretched thin by more than 226,900 illegal immigrants and other border crossers arriving in the Big Apple since April 2022, with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/07/us-news/nycs-poorest-zip-codes-forced-to-bear-brunt-of-migrant-crisis-confidential-docs-reveal/"&gt;vast majority of them seeking immediate shelter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of mid-December, the city’s migrant-crisis tab reached $6.5 billion as workloads – &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/migrant-crisis-spurred-nearly-3-million-overtime-hours-for-two-nyc-agencies-costing-taxpayers-139m/"&gt;including overtime costs &lt;/a&gt;– soared at various city agencies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The once-glamorous Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan in 2023 was converted into a modern-day version of Ellis Island, where migrants can get hot meals, help with asylum paperwork, medical care and health screenings.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams has tried to ease some of the burden by enforcing 60- and 30-day shelter-stay limits for families and adults, causing the number of migrants staying in taxpayer-funded city shelters to drop from over 65,000 a year ago to 53,800 as of Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the issue remains a daunting one for him heading into 2025, even with President-elect Donald Trump expected to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/30/us-news/nyc-is-now-home-to-over-58k-criminal-migrants-including-over-1000-gang-members-ice/"&gt;crack down on criminal migrants — including over 58,000 living in NYC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC’s homeless crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="block-eeaf63f9-244d-4bb1-8ac1-20946bc02d9e"&gt;There were over 112,700 people living in taxpayer-funded shelters as of Dec. 15, spurred by the ongoing influx of migrants.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="block-eeaf63f9-244d-4bb1-8ac1-20946bc02d9e"&gt;This doesn’t include the more than 4,100 homeless people living unsheltered in the streets and crime-ridden subways — &lt;a href="https://citylimits.org/2024/06/14/citys-yearly-street-homeless-estimate-climbs-to-2nd-highest-number-on-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the city’s highest number of unsheltered homeless people in nearly two decades. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The City Council earlier this month passed Adams’&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/us-news/mayor-adams-key-city-of-yes-initiative-inches-closer-with-5b-pledge-nyc-council-concessions/"&gt; controversial and ambitious “City of Yes” plan&lt;/a&gt; to help address the affordability crisis by building 80,000 new housing units over the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no immediate relief in sight. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/nyc-seeking-14000-hotel-rooms-to-shelter-migrants-through-2025/"&gt;The city is currently contracted with over 150 hotels&lt;/a&gt; that have been converted to homeless shelters serving migrants &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/us-news/121-nyc-hotels-converted-to-migrant-shelters-despite-concerns-of-cost-squeeze-on-tourists/"&gt;instead of serving tourism.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Council&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams and the Council’s far-left majority have been at odds since he took office and members snubbed his pick for Council speaker. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, it’s been a tug-of-war for political power involving vetoes, overrides and dueling bids to put changes to the City Charter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Adams and the Council will be duking it out in court in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Council earlier this month slapped Adams with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/nyc-council-sues-over-mayor-adams-executive-order-flouting-solitary-ban-in-city-jails/"&gt;lawsuit alleging the mayor abused his powers&lt;/a&gt; by issuing an executive order flouting a controversial solitary confinement ban in city jails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The foundation is set for a good working relationship between Trump and Adams, even though Adams will continue to be pressured by Dems and lefty media outlets to shun the Republican.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams in recent weeks has taken a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/03/us-news/mayor-adams-wants-migrants-charged-with-crimes-deported-from-nyc-in-major-shift-cancel-me/"&gt;tougher stance on the city’s sanctuary status&lt;/a&gt;, in line with Trump’s goals of deporting criminal migrants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has said he’d consider pardoning Adams if the mayor is convicted in his pending corruption case. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jovanny Hernandez / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Hizzoner – &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/mayor-adams-wont-rule-out-joining-gop-while-facing-crowded-field-of-dems-in-primary/"&gt;who has not ruled switching back to the Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; — might need Trump’s help if he’s convicted on the pending corruption charges. Earlier this month, Trump said he would consider pardoning Adams, if necessary, because &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/16/us-news/trump-says-hes-considering-pardoning-adams/"&gt;“he was treated pretty unfairly.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gov. Hochul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul has the power under a seldom-used state law to remove any mayor in the state from office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor has so far declined to oust the embattled Adams – in part because it would alienate prominent &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/04/us-news/hakeem-jeffries-says-eric-adams-should-not-resign-amid-growing-bipartisan-calls-for-nyc-mayor-to-step-down/"&gt;black leaders who’ve rallied behind him &lt;/a&gt;and because Cuomo, her political rival and former boss, is ready to jump into the mayor’s race.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that hasn’t stopped Hochul from pressuring Adams from behind the scenes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/us-news/gov-hochul-told-nyc-mayor-adams-to-clean-house-before-top-aide-resigned-amid-city-hall-legal-chaos-sources/"&gt;clean house&lt;/a&gt; if he wants to keep his job. Several City Hall officials touched by churning federal investigations have either resigned or been forced out since Adams’ indictment — an exodus driven by Hochul, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/hochul-pushing-staff-changes-at-titanic-city-hall-as-she-avoids-ousting-adams-before-nov-5-election-sources/"&gt;sources told The Post in October.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning up the NYPD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/opinion/yes-eric-adams-has-lowered-crime-but-not-nearly-enough/"&gt;Overall crime has dropped&lt;/a&gt; under Adams, but the Police Department’s reputation has been gutted by a series of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last week, NYPD Chief of Department &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-former-top-cop-jeffrey-maddreys-years-long-sexual-abuse-was-an-open-secret-sources-say-so-many-more-of-us/"&gt;Jeffrey Maddrey&lt;/a&gt;, a close friend of Adams, abruptly resigned after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;The Post uncovered explosive allegations&lt;/a&gt; that he demanded sexual favors from a subordinate in exchange for&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt; massive amounts of overtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rikers Island&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Rikers Island jail complex must close by August 2027 and be replaced by four smaller lockups under a 2019 law backed by then-Mayor de Blasio, however — Adams is far behind in implementing the plan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/23/what-a-federal-court-takeover-would-mean-for-rikers-island/"&gt;violence-plagued jail system on Rikers Island&lt;/a&gt; is in serious jeopardy of being put under a federal court’s control – despite objections from the Adams administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams remains far behind in implementing a mandated plan he inherited to shutter Rikers by August 2027 and replace it with four smaller, more humane lockups in each borough but Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More female officers in disgraced top cop Jeffrey Maddrey’s orbit pulled down massive overtime and other perks, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The driver for the former chief of department made an eye-popping $163,414 in OT last year — and resigned days after The Post exposed her boss’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;alleged sleazy conduct at police headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, records show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detective Ingrid Sanders was the seventh-highest overtime earner in the department, boosting her total salary last fiscal year to $352,462, records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That put her pay not far behind Lt. Quathisha Epps, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;top earner who made $403,515&lt;/a&gt;, including $204,453 in OT. Epps filed an explosive Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint accusing Maddrey of giving Epps overtime shifts in exchange for sex, The Post revealed in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/he-was-a-predator-nypd-lieutenant-recalls-horrifying-sex-demands-of-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;front-page exclusive&lt;/a&gt; Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Detective Ingrid Sanders (center) made over $350,000 last year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;instagram @nypddcer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Post’s inquiry, Maddrey quit. Sanders was immediately transferred from One Police Plaza to a Queens precinct, and filed for retirement on Dec. 23, The Post found in police documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanders is a first-grade detective — the top grade — who served in the chief of department’s office since December 2022. She followed Maddrey there from the Patrol Services Bureau. She didn’t return multiple messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey also sought favors for second detective, Ada Reyes, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps, Maddrey’s personnel manager, told The Post that part of her OT was devoted to taking care of Reyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The overtime that he would give me he would tell me to buy her things like get her some towels and things from Walmart, a microwave, and stuff like that so she doesn’t have to come out of her pocket,” Epps said. “I make the overtime and then I give things to her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Detective Ada Reyes made $55,923 in overtime. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD Hispanic Society/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He would have me go apartment hunting with her,” Epps said. “I would be at work and he would tell me to get up and go with her to look for an apartment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Epps claimed, Maddrey told her to rent an apartment that was in her adult children’s names on the Lower East Side to Reyes and her family because they were having trouble finding housing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two sources confirmed the apartment arrangement to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reyes made $42,500 in as a new police officer in 2019 but her pay jumped to $154,405 in 2024, including $55,923 in overtime, city records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Reyes came to work at NYPD headquarters in 2023, Maddrey told Epps to put her somewhere other than his 13th-floor office, Epps told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD top earner, Lieutenant Quathisha Epps, accused Maddrey of taking advantage of her fragile financial situation. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook / Quathisha Epps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ingrid [Sanders] and I worked directly for him, and he was very specific not to put Reyes in the office,” Epps said. “He didn’t want her and Ingrid bumping heads.” Reyes was assigned to a domestic violence unit in another part of the building, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reyes didn’t return multiple phone and text messages seeking comment. Nobody was at the apartment when The Post visited. A neighbor confirmed she and her husband lived there after looking at a photograph of her.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Epps’ alleged overtime agreement with Maddrey began because she was having financial problems and her home was being foreclosed on, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey, the highest ranking uniformed cop on the force, demanded “unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities” from Epps, between June 2023 and Dec. 16, 2024, the EEOC complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey would send her text messages telling her to close her door and “strip for me right now.” She would take video and send it to him, she told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps claimed she had sex with Maddrey between eight and 10 times on the couch in his inner office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first time, Maddrey told her he dreamed of having anal sex with her and then violently pulled her pants down and did so despite her repeatedly telling him to “stop,” she told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think he’s a predator,” Epps said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a Friday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, Maddrey’s lawyer, Lambros Lambrau, called Epps a “self-professed swinger” who is under investigation for “stealing time and putting in for overtime she never worked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now Lieutenant Epps got caught with her hands in the cookie jar and is trying to deflect her own wrongdoing by making these allegations against Chief Maddrey,” Lambrou said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, the truth is Lieutenant Epps had a consensual adult relationship, albeit for a short time with Jeff,” he said, adding they have a ton of evidence including “X rated and racy videos and photographs from Lieutenant Epps.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey didn’t speak during the press conference and ignored questions yelled at him from the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators searched a top floor of NYPD headquarters last week, seeking evidence in the tawdry sex-for-overtime scandal exposed by The Post, sources said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleuths performed a crime scene analysis in the 13th-floor office of recently ousted Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey at One Police Plaza, where he allegedly preyed on Lt. Quathisha Epps and demanded sexual favors from her in exchange for green-lighting her staggering overtime pay, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigators likely were looking for evidence of sexual abuse, a potential felony, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ex-Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey allegedly preyed on Lt. Quathisha Epps and demanded sexual favors from her in exchange for green-lighting her staggering overtime pay, a source said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epps alleged in an Equal Opportunity Complaint that Maddrey, the Force’s top uniformed cop, had sex with her eight to 10 times in his office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She’s alleging it was coerced. That’s non-consensual,” an ex-NYPD official said of a possible criminal charge in the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; the allegations on Friday, insisting the ex-NYPD honcho had a “consensual” relationship with Epps, and that he was weighing a civil suit against her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epps previously told The Post Maddrey first propositioned her in June 2023, telling his underling he wanted to have anal sex with her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then allegedly bent her over the couch in his office and violently pulled down her pants before reaching in a locker to pull out a bottle of KY-Jelly, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then had sex with her even after she said “stop,” Epps alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police officer close to Maddrey recently was seen&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;going into the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/ex-nypd-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-kicked-out-by-wife-after-tawdry-sex-for-ot-scandal-expose-sources/"&gt;disgraced&lt;/a&gt; ex-chief’s office and removing unknown items after The Post reached out to the NYPD for comment on Epps’ allegation last week, a second police source said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former stock car racer and self-proclaimed paranormal investigator has posted footage to YouTube he said shows drones flying off the New Jersey coast in “deliberate formations” over the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CJ Faison, a Delaware YouTuber with 600,000 subscribers, rented himself a boat, grabbed his night vision video camera, and ventured from the Pine Barrens to the ocean 26 miles east.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Faison claimed in the 45-minute video to be “doing something no YouTuber or news outlet has done.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;CJ Faison rented a boat to try to track down some drones. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He teased in the footage “we think we uncovered the truth” about the recent sightings of mysterious unmanned aircraft hovering over the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sightings of unidentified drones emitting strange light patterns started back in mid-November, and reached a fever pitch around Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The debate over what the drones actually are and who is controlling them rages on, with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/opinion/nj-drone-saga-shows-were-fed-up-with-government-gaslighting/"&gt;the feds providing little more&lt;/a&gt; than assurances they pose no threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Like most of the purported drone footage online, Faison’s footage from the rented boat fails to provide clear images of what he claimed were drones that emerged from the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A series of blinking lights was caught by Faison’s camera. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He noted the lights blinked in a pattern similar to the lights of commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He said drones he saw moved erratically and very quickly. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Faison walked away with more questions than answers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re blending in,” the YouTuber said. “Hidden in plain sight!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the alleged drones Faison filmed moved quickly, darting across the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s wild,” he proclaimed. “It’s eerie.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is only the beginning,” Faison further warned. “I have so many questions. What’s launching these drones? How are they staying airborne for hours? What’s their energy source? And why here? Why New Jersey?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Faison headed out at dusk to locate the mysterious aircraft. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Jersey officials &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/mystery-nj-drone-sightings-drop-after-early-december-surge/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; the number of sightings had dropped, with very little activity reported around Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drop-off follows FAA-imposed restrictions on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/faa-bans-drone-use-over-critical-infastrcutre-locations-in-new-york-city/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/faa-bans-drones-over-parts-of-new-jersey-threatens-deadly-force-for-imminent-security-threat/"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; airspace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FBI said it has investigated approximately 5,000 of the various reports it received from the public, with about 100 deemed credible. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/mystery-nj-drone-sightings-drop-after-early-december-surge/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final glittering crystal triangles that make up the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/times-squares-decade-old-midnight-moment-is-having-a-social-media-moment/"&gt; Times Square New Year’s Eve ball &lt;/a&gt;were installed Friday — revealing the new facade of the iconic geometric dome that will ring in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapper Pitbull carefully lodged the last triangle in its place at the unveiling, which marked the first time in a decade that all 2,688 pieces on the ball were replaced at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be the last time the 11,875-pound pound ball will make its descent atop One Times Square — the massive structure will be retired following this year’s New Year’s Eve party, along with its &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/video/new-years-eve-2025-numerals-arrive-in-times-square/"&gt;accompanying countdown numerals&lt;/a&gt;, and displayed in a museum planned for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;All 2,688 crystal triangles were replaced for the 2025 ball drop. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pitbull held the honor of placing the final triangle on the ball. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t fret: a new ball and numerals will be raised for next year’s celebration.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the weeks before the unveiling, lucky visitors had the chance to install the new 2025 crystals on the ball themselves — and take home one of the old triangles that were being replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2,688 crystal triangles vary in size, and range in length from 4 3/4 inches to 5 3/4 inches per side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new crystals showcase two special patterns: the 2025 design features long linear cuts with a circle near the top representing the 139′ pole and the iconic building famous for the ball drop celebration as an ode to One Times Square’s legacy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The old crystal triangles were given out to lucky New Yorkers earlier this month. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The ball and its numerals will be retired and displayed in an upcoming museum planned for 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ever Crystal design highlights the future to come and consists of three pairs of interlocking rings surrounded by diamond-shaped facets that provide the setting for the letter E, symbolizing unity and enduring love.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/woman-who-wrote-new-years-wish-on-times-square-confetti-in-nyc-reveals-dream-came-true/"&gt;The New Year’s Eve ball &lt;/a&gt;was first dropped in Times Square in 1907 and was much smaller than the behemoth unveiled Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 700-pound, 5-foot diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Six newer versions of the ball have been featured in the century-plus since that first celebration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Post Wires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arby’s may have “the meat,” but some customers have a beef.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Queens woman is accusing the fast food joint of downsizing its French fries and drinks without lowering prices or alerting customers in a class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Arby’s deceptively continues to sell its fries and beverages in smaller sizes which are now substantially smaller than the old sizes,” the suit, filed in Queens County Supreme Court, alleges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Queens woman is suing Arby’s in a class action suit for downsizing its portions of French fries and drinks without adjusting prices or notifying customers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The class action suit alleges Arby’s eliminated the kids portion of fries and made that the new “small.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF QUEENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The increase in prices may never be noticed by Arby’s purchasers, who may be left only with a strange feeling, short of satiety, even though this was due to … downsizing,” it continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By comparing nutritional facts for its different portions of fries, lawyers representing Melissa Nelson, of Ridgewood, found that Arby’s phased out its kids’ sized fries, made that portion the new small, the prior small the new medium, and the old medium the new large.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The company allegedly made the switch with its drinks, too, and did so “without any corresponding reduction in price … or disclosure to its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suit found that the small order of fries has the same amount of calories and protein as the old “kids” size. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF QUEENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crinkle fries at Arby’s now cost $3.74 for a small, $4.49 for a medium, and $4.99 for a large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a recent fast food run by The Post found all three sizes had nearly the same amount of fries inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move comes amid increasing instances of “shrinkflation,” when companies reduce quantities — often without changing package size — and only sometimes lower prices, and “greedflation,” when companies charge more for less in the face of rising inflation, the suit argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Customers relied on Arby’s “consistent sizes” at “relatively consistent prices” and have been misled into forking over more for less, according to the lawsuit. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A federal push to make “shrinkflation” illegal, the Shrinkflation Prevention Act, would prohibit downsizing without transparency and proportionate reductions in prices, and would prevent consumers from getting “shortchanged,” it notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/france-orders-retailers-display-shrinkflation-2024-04-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;countries, including France&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea, and Hungary have enacted laws that require clear notices that a product has been downsized without a corresponding reduction in price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social media users got wise to Arby’s moves, too, the lawyers found, with one even claiming that an employee said, “Arby’s corporate is downsizing all the size portions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arby’s “deceptively” continues to sell its fries and beverages in smaller sizes which are now substantially smaller than the old sizes, the suit charges. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers like Nelson have come to rely on Arby’s “consistent sizes” at “relatively consistent prices over time” and have been misled into forking over more for less, a violation of business law, the suit, which seeks unspecified damages, argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson seeks to represent any New Yorkers who purchased French fries and beverages at Arby’s in the state before the sizes were adjusted downwards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arby’s did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch ousted dozens of NYPD bosses in a shocking Saturday purge, beginning with the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau, a week after The Post revealed that top cop &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/he-was-a-predator-nypd-lieutenant-recalls-horrifying-sex-demands-of-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;Jeffrey Maddrey was allegedly trading overtime for sex&lt;/a&gt; at police headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deputy Chief Chris Morello, the No. 2 boss at the famed watchdog bureau whose mission is to weed out bad cops, was removed from his post, paperwork obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes a week after IAB’s top boss, Chief of Internal Affairs Miguel Iglesias, was ejected the day of the Dec. 21 expose in The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspector Joseph Profeta, who was head of IAB’s Group 1, was booted Saturday to Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, the documents show. The group investigates allegations regarding NYPD brass with the rank of captain or above. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tisch means business,” a high-ranking source said. “She’s cleaning up the mess and putting the department back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The moves were made because of a “lack of oversight” by IAB, the source said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deputy Chief Chris Morello was removed from his post, paperwork obtained by The Post shows. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chris Morello/Linkedin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inspector Michael Ricciardi of IAB Special Ops was also ousted and sent to Patrol Borough Manhattan North, the orders show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another dozen IAB bosses, ranging from lieutenants to sergeants, were sent packing to far-flung precincts across the city, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six members of Maddrey’s office — five detectives and one police officer — were also booted in the bloodletting, most of them sent to walk the beat in public housing, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sweeping changes come after The Post revealed in a Sunday front-page story that Chief of Department Maddrey was allegedly granting &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/nypd-lt-quathisha-epps-wants-suspension-lifted-following-maddrey-sexual-abuse-claims/"&gt;overtime for sex to Lt. Quathisha Epps&lt;/a&gt;, who raked in a total of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;more than $400,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to show that you are genuinely trying to change the face of the department and get rid of all of Maddrey’s cronies, this is the best way to do it,” a police officer with more than 20 years on the job said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Tisch ordered 500 officers who had been “improperly transferred” to go back to their regular assignments, an internal police memo obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The practice was known as “telephone message transfers” and led to a lack of boots on the ground in some areas and therefore slower response times, the Dec. 9 memo stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Post revealed that top cop Jeffrey Maddrey was allegedly trading overtime for sex at police headquarters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps claimed in graphic detail in an exclusive interview with The Post that Maddrey, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the NYPD, coerced her to have sex in his office between eight and 10 times, in exchange for the massive overtime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her lawyer, Eric Sanders, filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, a precursor to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former NYPD Chief Jeffrey Maddrey with his lawyer Lambros Lambrou in Manhattan on Dec. 26. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey abruptly retired the day of The Post report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;claimed through his lawyer&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that he had a “consensual, adult relationship” with Epps, but denied her accusation of “coercion.” The lawyer, Lambros Lambrou, said Maddrey had no authority to sign off on overtime pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Epps’ attorney told The Post, “This clown is a f–king disgrace. We have a treasure trove of digital data that will hopefully bring this degenerate to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/allan-goldman/?sh=68d5826a7737" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;real estate billionaire’s son &lt;/a&gt;should be barred from getting a share of his father’s fortune  — because he lied to try to cut his dad’s lover out of the will, she argued in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natalia Vostrikova insisted in new filings that Steven Gurney-Goldman had gone against his wealthy dad Allan’s wishes when he made gruesome allegations she neglected the ailing man, who died alone in Russia in January 2022 at age 78.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gurney-Goldman “now must face the consequences,” Vostrikova said in her Nassau County Supreme Court filing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Natalia Vostrikova (right) insisted in new filings that Steven Gurney-Goldman had gone against his wealthy dad Allan’s (center) wishes when he made gruesome allegations she neglected the ailing man. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Allan Goldman, who struggled with Parkinson’s disease for years, was the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/10/metro/nyc-real-estate-empire-a-real-life-succession-battle-lawsuit/"&gt;son of real estate tycoon Sol Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, who built a Manhattan real estate empire that once included the Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allan was in a “severely deteriorated” state with multiple organ failures and bedsores following a months-long visit to Russia with Vostrikova when he died, Gurney-Goldman claimed in a 2022 lawsuit filed against Vostrikova.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Vostrikova, the older man’s lover and caretaker who also served as the family nanny decades earlier, allegedly left Allan Goldman alone in a five-star hotel in Moscow while she lived a luxe life on his dime, Gurney-Goldman &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/us-news/longtime-caretaker-jealously-manipulated-nyc-billionaire-allan-goldman-before-letting-him-die-alone-in-russia-so-she-could-pocket-2m-inheritance-suit/"&gt;contended in the legal filing. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The son claimed Vostrikova neglected his dad in a bid to hasten his death — and collect her $2 million inheritance sooner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vostrikova, who also served as the family nanny decades earlier, allegedly left Allan Goldman alone in a five-star hotel in Moscow while she lived a luxe life on his dime, Gurney-Goldman contended in the legal filing.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Joe Ruback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vostrikova — who claims Russian authorities cleared her of any wrongdoing in Allan’s death — wants the whole case tossed out of court. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not only that they were in love, they were a couple. He cared for her and she cared for him,” said her lawyer Kian Khatibi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldman left an estate worth at least $250 million, court records show, and had a 25% interest in his father’s company, Solil Management, which is worth an estimated $12 billion,&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/goldman-family/#:~:text=Sol's%20daughter%20Jane%20heads%20up,worth%20an%20estimated%20%2412%20billion." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; according to Forbes.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goldman left an estate worth at least $250 million, court records show, and had a 25% interest in his father’s company, Solil Management, which is worth an estimated $12 billion, according to Forbes.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Gurney-Goldman contended that Vostrikova was not cleared of wrongdoing and that Russian authorities refused to investigate the matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the executor of his father’s will, Mr. Gurney-Goldman is upholding his fiduciary duty by bringing a wrongful death action against the woman whom we’ve alleged is responsible for his father’s untimely death,” attorney Daniel Noble said. “Ms. Vostrikova’s claim that Mr. Gurney-Goldman should be disinherited as a result is erroneous and meritless.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city Department of Education is so intent on firing a disabled teacher that it went to court two days before Christmas to terminate him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abraham Freud, who worked as a DOE special-ed teacher for 24 years, has become disabled himself, suffering from scoliosis and arthritis, making it impossible for him to physically handle a classroom of autistic students, he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m scared to lose my job and health benefits,” said Freud, 46, a father of four. “Just because I’m disabled doesn’t mean I’m garbage and should be thrown away.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Abraham Freud, a 46-year-old father of four, is begging the DOE to give him a less strenuous assignment: “I’m not useless!” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a bid to terminate special-ed teacher Abraham Freud, the city DOE filed a motion in court two days before Christmas. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing fight, the DOE filed a motion in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Dec. 23 asking a judge to lift an order blocking it from firing Freud, citing a “misuse of taxpayer funds” to continue paying his salary after he exhausted his sick days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Freud’s lawyer, Christina Martinez, called it not only “heartless” but a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This case shines a light on the DOE’s disregard for disabled employees and their legal rights,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Freud is physically unable to continue teaching severely disabled students at PS. K369, the Coy L. Cox school, at this site in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since November, Freud has been unable to teach at PS K369 in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, a K-to-12 school for kids with severe disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has repeatedly applied to work as an attendance teacher, which involves making phone calls and  visiting homes, but learned the DOE had blacklisted his file with a “problem code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “I never got back one response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOE said it could not answer questions on the case Friday because officials are off,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;torching death of a woman&lt;/a&gt; sleeping on a Brooklyn train has stirred up painful memories for a still- grieving mother — and left her outraged that the MTA hasn’t learned its lesson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When news of the shocking subway killing reached her in Arizona, Vicki Goble, 73, immediately thought about her son, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/man-36-killed-at-least-16-others-injured-in-harlem-subway-fire-report/"&gt;Garrett Goble&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2020 when someone started a fire on a No. 2 train he was operating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For me, there were shades of remembering my son and what he went through working for the MTA,” Goble told The Post Friday. “I just can’t imagine there were people on the train that just watched this guy do this, and did nothing to try to stop him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If an MTA worker had easier access to an extinguisher, Sunday’s victim could have been saved. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Garrett Goble pictured with his wife, Delilah, and their two boys.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goble helped over a dozen people escape to safety when someone started a fire on a No. 2 train he was operating.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Garret Goble, 36, &lt;span&gt;a married father &lt;/span&gt;of two sons, had just started his shift as a motorman on March 27, 2020, when a career criminal loaded a trash-filled shopping cart onto the 2 Train — and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/cops-arrest-alleged-arsonist-who-killed-mta-conductor-in-march/"&gt;set it ablaze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A six-year MTA veteran, Garrett Goble navigated the blazing train through the blackened subway tunnels to a Harlem station, where &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/28/hero-mta-worker-killed-in-harlem-subway-fire-was-dedicated-dad/"&gt;the hero dad&lt;/a&gt; helped evacuate more than a dozen passengers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He returned for his bag but died from smoke inhalation, his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The pain and memory of her son’s death forced Vicki Goble to leave Brooklyn’s Flatlands neighborhood in 2022 for Arizona, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They did nothing,” Vicki Goble said of the MTA, which still does not provide MTA workers with fire extinguishers in their cabins — something she and Garrett Goble’s wife, Delilah, have been calling on the agency to do since his death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m mad, because it’s like they forgot about my son,” Vicki Goble said. “It’s a shame that more things haven’t been done to improve fire safety on the subways, for the workers and the riders. They wanna do all this modernization of the stations, but without the workers and people who use it, you won’t have a subway system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A photo shows the inside of the train that Goble died in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They could at least put a fire extinguisher in the cabins of the conductors. That might give people a fighting chance to put out a fire. The people that are in power tend to forget where they came from.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA worker operating last weekend’s train may have been able “to save that woman if they had acted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman killed in last week’s subway car fire has &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;only been described as homeless.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guatemalan migrant &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/critics-say-bystanders-stood-by-while-illegal-migrant-burned-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-daniel-penny-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested for the heinous murder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am very disappointed,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The alleged arsonist Sebastian Zapeta-Calil was caught on video watching the woman burn alive.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Avinger, the man who started the 2020 fire, has yet to stand trial on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/cops-arrest-alleged-arsonist-who-killed-mta-conductor-in-march/"&gt;murder and arson charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An MTA spokesperson said fire extinguishers are only “kept along the tracks and within the booths at stations” — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/public-cant-access-fire-extinguishers-in-nyc-subways/"&gt;both areas the public cannot access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The MTA isn’t doing anything, especially with fire safety,” Vicki Goble said. “The system is so antiquated for a city this size, this great and this important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk County District Attorney’s office is probing allegations of animal neglect at the taxpayer-funded Holtsville Ecology Center in Long Island, following The Post’s reporting on claims &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/honey-the-bear-blasted-with-high-pressure-hose-at-troubled-holtsville-ecology-center-video/"&gt;its staff mistreated a 27-year-old bear named Honey&lt;/a&gt; before she was euthanized last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were asked to look into it so we will,” Tierney told The Post, declining to discuss details.&lt;/p&gt;

Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The refuge, which is licensed by the state Department of Environmental Conservation and curiously run by the town’s Highway Department, will be under “a lot more oversight now” by the town board members and the supervisor’s staff, Panico vowed. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DEC is conducting its own investigation and previously said it has interviewed some of the eight former workers who shared their concerns over the animals’ treatment with the advocacy group Humane Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The 3.5-acre refuge, which opened in 1974 on top of a former landfill and is free to the public, has roughly 100 sick or injured animals in its care that cannot survive in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The center came under fire in recent weeks after Honey, its star attraction, lost the use of the rear part of her body after she suffered a stroke and was euthanized on Nov. 22.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy gave new meaning to the slogan “Gottahava Wawa.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police in East Windsor, N.J., arrested a 24-year-old man on Dec. 23, and charged him with misusing the town’s 911 system for allegedly calling emergency dispatchers a total of 17 times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than take an Uber, Adam Vaughn allegedly wanted the town cops to personally shuttle him back and forth to the nearest Wawa — the popular convenience store — in neighboring Hightstown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, East Windsor police personally visited Vaughn at the Windsor Hotel where he was staying, and warned him to stop making the calls.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning came after Vaughn’s first few attempts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling 911, police informed him, was for emergencies only.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the warning went in one ear and out the other — as Vaughn allegedly kept peppering 911 with calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was ultimately placed in handcuffs after making his 17th plea for a police escort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to misusing 911, Vaughn received a criminal summons for obstruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some magic in the air in Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last December, Ana Cecy Malacara visited New York City for the first time and shared with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/23/metro/tourists-new-yorkers-flock-to-times-square-wishing-wall/"&gt;The Post &lt;/a&gt;at the &lt;a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/nye-wishing-wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Year’s Eve Wishing Wall&lt;/a&gt; her secret wish for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later she returned to her native Mexico. “After I was back, I was feeling strange,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I told my husband I need to get checked because I was having a lot of nausea. We thought it was a cold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, her dream written on a piece of Times Square confetti had come true — Ana was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Malacara visited the Wishing Wall in Dec. 2023 and wrote her dream for a new baby on a piece of confetti.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Grecia, whose name means Grace in English, was born on Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were trying for three or four months and we couldn’t conceive yet,” said Ana, 29, who shares another daughter, 3 year-old Lucia, with her now-husband, Victor Serrano, 31, who proposed to her during the NYC trip. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Grecia Serrano was born on Aug. 15, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ana Cecy Malacara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a powerful thing that confetti.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, on New Year’s Eve, another 3,000 pounds of confetti will be tossed from the rooftops of Times Square after the ball drops at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fluttering spectacle of 25 million pieces of shredded paper will be broadcast on “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest.” Ana says her family will be watching, as always.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The couple, pictured here with their daughters Lucia, 3, and Grecia, 4 months, got married on Dec. 21.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ana Cecy Malacara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wishing Wall, located on Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets, opened on Dec. 2. The Times Square Alliance, which runs it, said it has already collected 100,000 wishes. Last year, 150 countries were represented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ana, a General Motors engineer, says she will be back one day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I fell in love with New York, and my daughter, Lucia, she keeps telling me, ‘I want to go to New York.'” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/14/us-news/nearly-1k-drone-sightings-reported-in-nj-in-less-than-a-month/"&gt;drone activity over New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; has taken a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/former-defense-official-makes-earth-shattering-revelation-as-mystery-drones-cause-concern/"&gt;reported drone sightings&lt;/a&gt; dropped off considerably, officials in Ocean County said this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific numbers were not released, but Ocean County Sheriff Michael G. Mastronardy confirmed fewer sightings of the unmanned aircraft being called in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drones have been invading the area since mid-November. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;@MendhamMike/Storyful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some sightings continue, with social media footage from Somerset, Ocean and Bergen counties capturing more alleged drone activity in the sky above the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete answers from federal officials concerning what the drones are, where they are from and their purpose remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastronardy, who at one point &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/14/us-news/sophisticated-drones-over-nj-could-be-part-of-iran-china-alliance-pol/"&gt;launched his own drone&lt;/a&gt; to try to track the mysterious aircraft, said his office took more reports about drone sightings on Dec. 8 and 9 than any other day since they started in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dropoff follows FAA-imposed restrictions on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/faa-bans-drone-use-over-critical-infastrcutre-locations-in-new-york-city/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/faa-bans-drones-over-parts-of-new-jersey-threatens-deadly-force-for-imminent-security-threat/"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; airspace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Monmouth County was a hotbed for drone sightings. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/Monmouth County Sheriff's Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FBI said it has investigated approximately 5,000 of the various reports it received from the public, with about 100 deemed credible. Federal officials maintain the drones pose no threat to national security or the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYPD’s hot-headed Deputy Commissioner of Public Information —  who once called a New York Post reporter a “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/fbi-raids-home-of-nypd-commish-edward-caban-other-close-eric-adams-allies/"&gt;f–king scumbag&lt;/a&gt;” — was demoted this week, police sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarik Sheppard, a 21-year veteran of the NYPD, will be an assistant chief and commanding officer at the Interagency Operations Division as of Dec. 26, NYPD paperwork shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s definitely a downward move but a soft landing,” a police source said of Sheppard, a friend of Mayor Adams.  &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sheppard once called a New York Post reporter a “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/fbi-raids-home-of-nypd-commish-edward-caban-other-close-eric-adams-allies/"&gt;f–king scumbag&lt;/a&gt;” while reporting on the raids against former NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear exactly why he was booted from his post, but Sheppard, 48, got into a kerfuffle with then-acting Police Commissioner Tom Donlon at the NYC Marathon in November and has had run-ins with the media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sheppard, who was once commander of the 28th Precinct in Harlem, was appointed DCPI by former Police Commissioner Edward Caban in August 2023 and brought a cadre of his own people with him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He expanded the office from about 40 employees to 86. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of them are now being transferred out of the office too, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In one of his controversial moves, Sheppard moved reporters who cover the NYPD and worked for decades in a second-floor warren of offices nicknamed “The Shack” to a modular building outside police headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed it was to make more room for “ethnic media,” but the space is usually utilized by the same handful of journalists who previously worked inside the main building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sheppard called a Post City Hall reporter a “f–king scumbag” after the reporter reached out to Chief of Patrol John Chell for comment about a federal investigation of city officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City’s biggest overtime hogs for a second straight year are mostly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/18/metro/migrant-crisis-sees-jaw-dropping-overtime-hours-for-nyc-agencies/"&gt;rank-and-file workers responsible for tackling the Big Apple’s $6 billion-plus migrant crisis, &lt;/a&gt;The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one of the 100 city employees who racked up the most OT during the fiscal year ending June 30 work at the Departments of Social Services and Homeless Services, and their duties include assisting migrants, an &lt;a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/widgets/k397-673e?mobile_redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;examination of city payroll records shows.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each worker accumulated at least 1,851 hours in extra pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rank-and-file workers responsible for tackling the Big Apple’s $6 billion-plus migrant crisis predominantly clocked the most overtime hours of any city workers.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J. Messerschmidt for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kashwayne Burnett, a DSS bookkeeper, clocked 3,303 overtime hours — the most of any city worker.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading the way was Kashwayne Burnett, a DSS bookkeeper who worked 3,303 hours of overtime in the agency’s Manhattan office. That comes to roughly 14 hours a day, seven days a week. The 10-year veteran’s $164,760 in overtime pay more than tripled his $60,445 base salary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bardhan Pijush, a DSS caseworker, was second with 3,137 extra hours, followed by Gavin McAuley, a DHS housekeeper who clocked 2,664 hours of OT.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In the previous fiscal year, 47 employees at both departments were among the 100 who worked the most OT, a huge leap from fiscal 2022 when only three workers made the list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The migrant crisis “has been a major drain” on all municipal resources, but the DSS and DHS’s overtime hours and payouts are “absolutely staggering,” City Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We simply can’t continue down this path,” he said. “It has to end, and taxpayers are sick of it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DSS and DHS staffers have been especially stretched thin by the more than 226,900 asylum seekers and other border crossers who’ve reached the Big Apple since April 2022 – and many have seen their workloads soar because of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Friday the city’s migrant-crisis tab was $6.5 billion, and 53,800 migrants were still in city care at taxpayer-funded shelters as of Dec. 15, city officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;DSS and DHS workers racked up 2,959,114 hours of overtime combined, totaling more than $139.4 million in payouts.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both agencies in fiscal 2024 racked up a jaw-dropping 2,959,114 hours of overtime combined, totaling more than $139.4 million in payouts, records show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a staggering 67% increase from the 1,770,634 overtime hours worked by DSS and DHS staffers in fiscal 2021, which predated the migrant crisis, while agencies’ workers earnings for extra shifts have nearly doubled since then, from $72.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also a 10% increase from fiscal 2023, when the agencies’ staff &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/18/metro/migrant-crisis-sees-jaw-dropping-overtime-hours-for-nyc-agencies/"&gt;combined to rack up 2,690,659 additional hours, totaling $123.1 million in overtime earnings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York taxpayers are still on the hook for picking up the tab for the Biden administration’s border blunders, warned Ken Girardin, director of research for the nonprofit think tank Empire Center for Public Policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The bill is still running — we’re going to see bills like this for at least another year,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the surge in OT to help migrants, DSS spokesperson Neha Sharma said the agency is “extremely grateful” to its staffers who, “despite truly unprecedented challenges, have stepped up and worked long hours to provide necessary support for our newest arrivals and long-term New Yorkers in need.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is because of our remarkable staff that the City of New York can continue to do more than any other level of government to support asylum seekers while providing robust services and support to vulnerable New Yorkers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burnett and Pijush did not return messages. McAuley could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
