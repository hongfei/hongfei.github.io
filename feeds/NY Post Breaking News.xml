&lt;p&gt;A 71-year-old Long Island man was arrested for shooting a stranger who chased him in front of a Starbucks over the weekend, cops and prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rech wounded the 21-year-old man just before 5 a.m. Saturday outside the coffee shop at 1 Wall St. in Huntington, according to the criminal complaint filed against him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why the younger unidentified Fort Salonga man was running after Rech, but the suspect shot him in the stomach and leg, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old underwent surgery for serious but non-life-threatening wounds at Huntington Hospital, according to cops and the court doc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rech of Huntington was arrested and charged with felony assault, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a valid license for the gun, which was recovered, according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was ordered held on $25,000 cash bail, $50,000 bond or $250,000 partially secured bond and is set to reappear in court Jan. 15, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rech’s lawyer, Robert Macedonio, said he is confident his client will ultimately walk free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John is a licensed firearm holder authorized to have concealed carry,” Macedonio told The Post by phone Monday. “And we are gathering all the video footage from several locations in Huntington Village where this incident took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we believe, once we obtain all that, it will show that Mr. Rech acted appropriately within the confounds of the law and these charges will be dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pair of juvenile brutes snuck up on an elderly woman in Central Park and shoved her to the ground so hard they fractured her elbow around Thanksgiving, cops said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sickening assault took place while the woman, 69, was strolling south on 106th Street East Drive around 4:30 p.m. on Nov. 30, according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brutes then took off. The woman, meanwhile, was taken to a local urgent care by private car and treated for a left elbow fracture, the NYPD said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information on the incident can call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or, for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s trashing junk fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed a pair of executive orders Monday cracking down on junk fees and tricky subscriptions that trap unwitting New Yorkers into seemingly never-ending — and ultimately costly — tiny debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gyms are notorious for shadily billing customers with fees or underhanded subscriptions, Mamdani said at an outdoor gym along the Long Island City waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;

Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is by no means limited solely to the gym industry — we reckon with it when we try to buy concert tickets, when we book a flight, when we settle our credit card bill, or even when we pay rent,” he said, noting $5 and $10 fees add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These fees are not only making it harder for our neighbors to afford life in this city, they are also a sign of disdain and disrespect that corporations and bad landlords hold for working people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first executive order creates a junk fee task force that will target businesses leveling hidden charges against customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, under the second order, will work to fight subscription traps, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crackdown dovetails with state Attorney General Letitia James leveling a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/tish-gets-ripped-new-yorkers-not-impressed-with-ags-move-to-go-after-gyms/"&gt;$600,000 fine against the luxury gym Equinox&lt;/a&gt; for making it too strenuous for customers to cancel memberships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James attended Mamdani’s news conference, along with incoming City Council Speaker Julie Menin and Samuel Levine, the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen these hidden costs referred to as service fees, as add on fees, as profitable fees,” James said. “At the end of the day, the bottom line is that they were all hidden fees, and it was difficult for individuals to cancel these fees, but not anymore”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani had tapped former Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/14/us-news/zohran-mamdanis-transition-leader-lina-khan-seeks-more-power-for-him/"&gt;scour city laws &lt;/a&gt;for ways to protect consumers. He tied the junk fees crackdown to his affordability agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is hard enough to live in New York City without having to worry all the time about whether you’re being ripped off,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corpse was discovered inside a burning dumpster near a Queens strip mall early Monday, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grisly discovery was made before 7 a.m. when they found an adult male’s body inside the flaming receptacle outside the Conduit Plaza strip on North Conduit Avenue near Springfield Boulevard in Springfield Gardens, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDNY descended on the scene when they received a call of a dumpster fire with someone possibly inside, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALBANY – Gov. Kathy Hochul and lawmakers want to further beef up privacy protections for kids online, as the state legislature is set to return to Albany this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul said Monday she wants to boost parents’ control over their children’s’ online activity by expanding age verification requirements and making it harder for strangers to directly message kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life is hard enough later on down the road. Let’s let you embrace the freedom, the joy, and the wonder of learning and understanding relationships and the power of the teacher to have an effect on you,” Hochul told students at her former high school in Hamburg, NY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul will officially make the proposals part of her State of the State address on Jan. 13 as she unveils her 2026 agenda priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

style="aspect-ratio:1.49926794;display:block" width="885"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul says she wants more regulations on social media and online gaming platforms in 2026. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals, based on legislation from state Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Brooklyn) and Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D-Queens), follows through on efforts in Albany to reign in the roles that big tech and social media play in young New Yorkers’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Hochul implemented a statewide ban on kids having phones in school and signed a piece of legislation from Rozic and Gounardes that required social media companies to display health warning labels on their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York in 2024 also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/20/us-news/ny-gov-kathy-hochul-signs-bill-banning-addictive-social-media-feeds-for-kids-the-first-in-the-nation/"&gt;implemented legislation&lt;/a&gt; barring social media companies from pushing “addictive” algorithms for their products and profiting off data from users under 18-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal being pushed by Hochul this year would expand age verification requirements to include gaming platforms, require parent approval for kids under 13 to accept messages and make new connections with strangers, disable AI chatbot features for kids and require sites and apps to implement parental controls over financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s back in the fast lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani said he would resurrect a Brooklyn bike lane redesign project that had been scrapped by his predecessor Eric Adams’ administration under a cloud of alleged corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGuiness Boulevard in Greenpoint will have protected bike lanes along its full length from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge, Mamdani announced over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move restored the plan that Adams’ consigliere Ingrid Lewis-Martin had controversially pushed to end in 2023 after Greenpoint bigwigs &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/21/us-news/mayor-adams-longtime-confidant-ingrid-lewis-martin-allegedly-accepted-over-75k-in-bribes-bombshell-indictments-reveal/"&gt;allegedly showered her in bribes&lt;/a&gt;, including a cameo in the Hulu show “Godfather of Harlem” opposite Forest Whitaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani alluded to the scandal by denouncing his predecessor’s administration as bowing to “big-money interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both were killed by hit-and-run drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the backing of local elected officials such as state Assemblywoman Emily Gallagher (D-Brooklyn), city planners crafted a plan to add protected bike lanes and other traffic-slowing measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some powerful locals — notably Gina and Tony Argento, siblings who own the Broadway Stages studio — opposed the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Argentos allegedly paid off Lewis-Martin with $2,500, along with a speaking role on the “Godfather of Harlem” show, to get the mayor’s office to redraw the plans, Manhattan prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do not care what they say,” Lewis-Martin allegedly texted Gina Argento about the Make McGuinness Safe group. “We are ignoring them and continuing with our plan. They can kiss my ass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s still the boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani was forced to clarify Monday that NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch still directly reports to him — after an executive order he signed sparked confusion and rumors that the city’s top cop had effectively been demoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downgrade chatter erupted after Mamdani, in the order issued on his first day as mayor, gave his first deputy Dean Fuleihan the authority to supervise the NYPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many City Hall watchers, including some reporters, interpreted the order as knocking Tisch several pegs down the administration’s totem pole — prompting Mamdani to clarify that nothing had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My police commissioner will continue to report directly to me,” he said at a unrelated news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive order that Mamdani signed on New Year’s Day put the NYPD under the first deputy mayor’s portfolio in terms of nitty-gritty governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent previous mayors had typically done that until Mayor Eric Adams broke with the practice and put the top cop under the purview of his first deputy mayor for public safety, a position that had been dormant since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Banks, who held the first deputy mayor for public safety post under Adams, faced accusations of meddling with the NYPD and eventually &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/phil-banks-deputy-mayor-and-close-eric-adams-pal-resigns/"&gt;resigned amid a sprawling federal corruption probe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tisch and Mamdani have acknowledged disagreements. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mamdani’s executive order did little more than restore the police commissioner to the first deputy mayor’s bureaucratic purview, some construed it as a wholesale shakeup that threatened the NYPD itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rumors began to spread that Mamdani had stopped receiving daily intelligence briefings from the NYPD commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swirling fears prompted the National Jewish Advocacy Center — which also had raised alarms about Mamdani &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/01/us-news/mayor-zohran-mamdani-issues-sweeping-executive-order-that-wipes-out-most-eos-issued-by-adams-after-indictment/"&gt;revoking Adams’ executive orders&lt;/a&gt; on antisemitism — to send a pointed letter to the new mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tisch has widely been seen as a potential moderating force within the democratic socialist Mamdani’s administration. The pair have acknowledged differences on policies, including those related to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani, when asked about the change, stressed that being supervised on a day-to-day basis by the first deputy mayor is different than ultimately reporting to mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My police commissioner, just like my schools chancellor, will report directly to me,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The executive order is in terms of the question of coordination. This is about the daily minutiae of coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter at your own risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New signs unveiled at some Wegmans across the Big Apple are warning customers that personally-identifying biometric data, such as facial recognition scans, is being stored while they shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs, posted this month in the grocery stores’ Brooklyn and Manhattan locations and &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-wegmans-is-storing-biometric-data-on-shoppers-eyes-voices-and-faces" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first reported by Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;, will be used to “protect the safety and security of our patrons and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New signs unveiled at Brooklyn and Manhattan Wegmans grocery store locations are warning customers that personally-identifying biometric data is being stored as they shop. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WABC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wegmans … collects, retains, converts, stores or shares customers’ biometric identifier information which may include facial recognition, eye scans, voiceprints,” the notices read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is information that can be used to help identify you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rochester-based chain’s data collection began during a 2024 pilot, which vowed that shoppers’ data would not be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current signs posted across two locations around Gotham make no such promise, instead only committing to not “lease, trade or otherwise profit from the transfer of biometric identifier information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wegmans rep told The Post that the tech is only being used in a “small fraction of our stores that exhibit an elevated risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Wegmans, the safety of our customers and employees is a top priority. Like many retailers, we use cameras to help identify individuals who pose a risk to our people, customers, or operation,” the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The system collects facial recognition data and only uses it to identify individuals who have been previously flagged for misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Rochester-based chain’s data collection began during a 2024 pilot, which vowed that shoppers’ data would not be saved. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only biometric data stored at Wegmans is facial recognition scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images and video are kept “as long as necessary for security purposes” and then deleted. The grocery chain would not disclose the “exact retention period,” claiming it was for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other grocery and retail locations in the five boroughs – like Fairway Market, Westside Market and Walgreen’s – already implement biometric data collection in stores, &lt;a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/op-ed/op-ed-ny-shops-your-biometric-data-another-steep-cost"&gt;according to Crain’s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a New York City law went into effect mandating stores collecting biometric data post clear signs indicating such – but the enforcing agency has no enforcement power, Gothamist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A City Council bill, &lt;a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6166887&amp;amp;GUID=F171CD59-3CB3-4C33-B701-C801E9C0A71C"&gt;introduced in 2023&lt;/a&gt; by member Shahana Hanif, proposed banning the practice of biometric data collection altogether. But the bill failed to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, Madison Square Garden CEO James Dolan&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/13/metro/judge-oks-nyc-suit-over-msg-james-dolan-using-tech-to-ban-enemies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; came under fire after using facial recognition software to boot two attorneys and critics &lt;/a&gt;from entering the Midtown venue and Radio City Music Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Currently, the only biometric data stored at Wegmans is facial recognition scans, while the company claims “other biometric data such as retinal scans or voice prints” are not being saved. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since this bill was heard last session, there have been countless developments that have made the passage … more urgent than ever, including wrongful arrests and data leaks,” Hanif said in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pointed to the Federal Trade Commission’s finding that the pharmacy chain &lt;a href="https://statescoop.com/nonprofit-ftc-complaint-automated-benefits-responsible-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rite Aid used facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to “falsely and disproportionately identify thousands of people of color and women as likely shoplifters, including those right here in New York City” as an egregious example of the dangers of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wegmans told The Post that “persons of interest” are determined by its asset protection team on a case-by-case basis through information from police for criminal or missing persons cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand concerns about fairness and bias in facial recognition systems” and employ “training and safety measures to help keep people safe,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facial recognition technology serves as one investigative lead for us,” the rep added. “We never base our decisions on a single lead alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s “Point Break” on Montauk Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where homegrown Long Island thrill seekers summoning their best Patrick Swayze impersonations, hit the ferocious Atlantic in the winter months for an ultimate — and perilous — surf in nearly subzero temps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, this can kill you,” longtime winter surfer Dr. John Kavanaugh, sporting shoulder-length hair and a goatee, told The Post just before catching waves in windy, 26-degree weather at Ditch Plains &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/real-estate/oceanfront-mobile-home-in-a-hamptons-trailer-park-asks-3-49m/"&gt;in Montauk&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. John Kavanaugh is one of many Long Islanders who get a rush from surfing in the winter. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dennis A. Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are days out there where there are ice blocks … some people say ‘you guys are crazy.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They think we’re nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The East Hampton chiropractor isn’t the only one catching curls with snow on the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A band of about a dozen others were riding crisp waves off Montauk’s bluffs on a Wednesday afternoon last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the waves are good, people come. Like a really good Saturday, it will get crowded,” Kavanaugh, 60, said of the traditional summer hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“… now it will get crowded in the winter,” added the Plainview native, who’s been at it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kavanaugh said winter surfing on Long Island attracts a very white collar crowd nowadays. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dennis A. Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module alignright"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene in the dangerously cold ocean waters has shifted from merely daredevils and the “Jeff Spicoli” crowd to more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Surfing is no longer just the bums, the high school dropouts,” joked Kavanaugh, whose Spuds MacKenzie-like pooch, Ozzie, joins him at the beach. “Now it’s everybody, we’re all doctors and lawyers now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been getting busier with the work from home stuff … a lot of finance guys are out here year-round,” said Kavanaugh, who hit the water Friday afternoon before heading back to his practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the beaches less touristy and more open in the cold season is a nice touch, but the regulars, he added, are used to surfing around the extra bodies like they’re buoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a special camaraderie among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/17/us-news/millennial-turns-montauk-into-margaritaville/"&gt;salt-of-the-earth locals &lt;/a&gt;who brave the elements when Montauk gets sleepy in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the gut check to get in the ocean requires more than a tolerance for being soaking wet in the bone-chilling temps, the seasoned surfer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s harder because that water is thicker in the winter, so you’re moving slower. …These wetsuits, you’re not flying around,” said Kavanaugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this cold stuff, you’ve got to be careful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s coming from a man who “almost died” while surfing 25-foot waves during a July 4 storm, a years ago, that had three others around him “crying and puking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those gutsy enough to enter the frigid waters at Montauk Point do so for reasons beyond bravado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s harder, but it’s beautiful, and we get better waves in the winter,” Kavanaugh said, claiming he can survive the water for a few hours on a good day with low wind. “The winter coldness, it’s invigorating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t get that this summer — it just wakes you up. You get in there, you’re like, ‘Whoa!’ Then later, when you warm up, you get this feeling, yeah, it’s pretty intense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city will be hosting a series of “rental ripoff” hearings with tenants across the five boroughs and taking action against “unconscionable” business practices in the coming months, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers will be able to lament about their rental woes – from hidden fees, retaliation, discrimination, illegal eviction and deplorable building conditions – during Mamdani’s first 100 days in office, according to an executive order signed by the mayor on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The city will be hosting a series of “rental ripoff” hearings with tenants across the five boroughs, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/zohrankmamdani&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a city filled with older buildings that could use some tender loving care, some landlords are taking advantage of the housing market to gouge tenants with outrageous fees, all while leaving them trying to survive in homes with collapsing ceilings and sinking floors,” Mamdani said in an Instagram video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need a citywide crackdown on rental rip-offs,” he added. “For the first time, our city is bringing this discussion directly to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “rental ripoff” hearings will also include tenant organizations, social services agencies, advocacy organizations and legal service providers, as well as landlords and property managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint effort will be conducted by the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Buildings, Consumer and Worker Protection and the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants in coordination with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/02/us-news/mayor-mamdani-hires-longtime-dsa-organizer-to-head-new-outreach-arm-of-nyc-to-energize-comrade-base/"&gt;Mamdani’s brand-new Office of Mass Engagement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one hearing will be held in each of the five boroughs, City Hall said, and the administration will use findings from the public meetings to publish a report, including “common themes and areas of opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The testimony shared at these hearings will directly inform policy interventions to take on these ripoff tactics,” according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;At least one hearing will be held in each of the five boroughs, City Hall said, and the administration will use findings from the hearings to publish a report, including “common themes and areas of opportunity.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tomas E. Gaston for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Mayor for Economic Justice Julie Su noted in a statement that the hearings may also result in the city taking action on bad actors “to ensure that the law is followed without exception and that New Yorkers know their rights when it comes to the often hidden or deceptive fees associated with the hunt for housing.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long, tenants have been ripped off without recourse or protection,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/zohran-mamdanis-new-nyc-tenant-advocate-called-to-seize-private-property-blasted-home-ownership-as-white-supremacy/"&gt;Cea Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Mayor’s Office of to Protect Tenants, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Rental Ripoff hearings will give working people across the five boroughs a microphone to highlight the challenges they face and make New York City government a truly participatory endeavor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive inferno ripped through a Bronx apartment building early Monday — injuring three people, including two firefighters — as the FDNY’s response was hampered by illegally parked cars too close to hydrants, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze started in a deli on Findlay Avenue around 3:15 a.m. and the flames spread to the apartment units on the several floors above it and slightly to the wing of the next building, fire department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One civilian and two firefighters suffered minor injuries, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire trucks reached the scene in less than four minutes — but the response was slowed by “three cars parked on three different hydrants,” said FDNY Chief of Department John Esposito &lt;a href="https://x.com/FDNY/status/2008180752844738779?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a little bit of an ice condition but the biggest issue was those blocked fire hydrants,” he said. “Our firefighters are very good but it does delay us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cars were ticketed and towed, according to the FDNY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then almost immediately interrupted his court appearance with a proclamation of his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge shot back, “Let me interfere — there will be a time and a place to go into all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your counsel will be able to make motions. … At this time, I just want to know one thing: Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ousted dictator replied, “I am Nicholas Maduro Moros.’’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maduro, who furiously scribbled notes on a white piece of paper during the proceedings, denounced the indictment against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife Cilia Flores, who also faces a rash of charges, said at the same proceeding that she is “completely innocent” when asked by  Hellerstein for her plea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maduro also asked that his notes be “respected” during the hearing and that he be “entitled to keep them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer Barry Pollack, who also questioned the legality of Maduro’s capture, said that although the toppled Venezuelan strongman was not seeking immediate release, he may submit a bail application at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his sweeping executive order targeting his predecessor Eric Adams’ legacy as a way to disguise his intention to revoke city policies that support Israel, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The far-left socialist never planned to extend executive Adams’ orders that supported the Jewish state, but his inner circle was concerned that his day-one overhaul would upset Jewish groups he’d vowed to protect on the campaign trail, the New York Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s lawyers briefed the newly minted mayor in recent days on how he could revoke the pro-Israel policies enacted by his predecessor — by either canceling all of Adams’ executive orders from 2025 or deal with them one at a time, sources told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Mamdani ultimately decided to rescind every executive order issued by Adams since the day he was indicted on federal corruption charges in Sept. 2024, which included two key policies that protected Israel and combatted antisemitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After issuing the order, Hizzoner insisted that it gave his administration a “clean slate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the revoked anti-Israel orders is one signed by Adams just last month that barred city officials from boycotting or divesting from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another repealed an order that adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which Adams’ administration said included “demonizing Israel and holding it to double standards as forms of contemporary antisemitism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revocations drew immediate pushback from Israel,  whose Foreign Ministry accused Mamdani of dumping “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coalition of US Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and the UJA Federation of New York said in a more stately criticism Friday that Mamdani “reversed two significant protections against antisemitism,” according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s spokesperson, Dora Pokec, told the Times that discussions on revoking Adams’ orders had been ongoing “throughout the fall, throughout the transition, and communicated directly to the public that this was our intention, even before they cast ballots for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani on Saturday said the decision was made to restore the public’s trust in the office of the mayor after Adams’ indictment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents of the city’s “Little Caracas” — a stretch of Roosevelt Avenue that runs through the predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona — told The Post that the capture of&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/marco-rubio-says-venezuelan-vp-delcy-rodriguez-isnt-a-legitimate-leader/"&gt; former President Nicolás Maduro &lt;/a&gt;on Saturday was a long-awaited moment of reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Eric Gonzalez, a 41-year-old car salesman from Queens, said Maduro’s capture was a long-awaited moment of reckoning for the Venezuelan people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing news because we’ve been suffering with this guy for a long time. So it’s been more than 26 years that we’ve been waiting for this,” said Eric Gonzalez, a 41-year-old car salesman from Queens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So now that the US Army went all the way over there to take him out, that makes us all so, so happy,” he said of the moment Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were flown to the States and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/03/world-news/read-the-indictment-against-nicolas-maduro-wife-cilia-flores-after-us-forces-captured-the-couple/"&gt;indicted on a slew of federal charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez is originally from the northwestern Venezuelan city of Maracaibo and has been living in the US for 10 years. He fled the country in 2015, both over his opposition to Maduro’s authoritarian regime and to seek better economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, it was always so dangerous to go back because I was always against this. So every single person that is against it is in danger.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, his mother, who remains in Venezuela, called Gonzalez crying about what he described as a moment of hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duvin Flores, a 19-year-old waiter at El Budare Cafe, said that a party of roughly 50 people celebrating Maduro’s ousting spontaneously erupted at the Roosevelt Avenue eatery on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yesterday, this was a party right here, many people came, and they celebrated,” Flores said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter moved to the US from Venezuela nearly three years ago and now lives in Jackson Heights. His 60-year-old grandmother remains in the country, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People come from different countries, not only Venezuela. We have been waiting for this moment for 26 years, and we can see the liberty in Venezuela, the freedom,” Flores said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dictator &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/world-news/maduros-path-to-justice-from-venezuela-compound-to-nyc-jail/"&gt;was carted across the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; via helicopter, amphibious assault ship, and military plane on Saturday, with a stint in Guantánamo Bay, before arriving in New York to face a litany of federal charges.&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/world-news/maduros-path-to-justice-from-venezuela-compound-to-nyc-jail/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors have accused Maduro of leading “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,” according to his indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He allegedly partnered with violent drug traffickers and narco-terrorists to bring upwards of 250 tons of cocaine into the US by 2020, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are being &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/inside-notorious-nyc-jail-where-maduro-wife-are-being-held/"&gt;held in Brooklyn’s infamous Metropolitan Detention Center&lt;/a&gt; and are awaiting an arraignment in federal court on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongman was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/world-news/satellite-images-reveal-devastation-from-us-strike-that-captured-nicolas-maduro/"&gt;nabbed at his Caracas palace in a daring US raid&lt;/a&gt; and is now being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn pending his arraignment Monday on a four-count indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If found guilty, Maduro is likely to spend the rest of his life behind bars — or worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under federal law, a defendant found guilty of violating the Controlled Substances Act “as part of a continuing criminal enterprise” can be eligible for the death penalty, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R42095" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal capital offenses fall under categories that are, namely, homicide, treason or espionage and drug offenses that do not include a homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, death sentences for drug offenses are far from common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most capital offenses involve a homicide,” the site said. “More defendants are sentenced to death for murder than for all of the other federal capital offenses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007428087143686611" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post on X on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, US Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts” but did not mention what sentence the Justice Department would seek if there is a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Here’s the latest on Nicolás Maduro’s capture:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/mayor-mamdanis-comrades-in-dsa-demand-trump-release-nicolas-maduro/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayor Mamdani’s comrades in DSA demand Trump release Nicolas Maduro: ‘Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution!’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s raid on Venezuela has drawn comparisons to the 1989 strike on Panama to capture Manual Noriega on orders from President George H. W. Bush — with the US opting for prison for Noriega.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maduro and other Venezuelan leaders were originally named in a 2020 drug trafficking indictment, with a federal grand jury this year adding the new counts to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
