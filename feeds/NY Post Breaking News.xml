&lt;p&gt;Ex-NYPD &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/28/metro/ex-nypd-commish-says-adams-foes-on-foolish-cop-stops-bill-just-want-to-weaken-mayor-for-next-election/"&gt;Commissioner Bill Bratton &lt;/a&gt;says the city needs more cops to crack down on subway mayhem and other crime, noting there were thousands more officers when he was first in charge in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bratton, who served as Gotham’s police commissioner under Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Bill de Blasio, said there were 38,000 officers when he was first commish and that the figure is now down to under 34,000, even after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/nypd-classes-canned-over-migrant-crisis-budget-cuts-to-be-reinstated-adding-1-6k-cops-by-next-fall/"&gt;Mayor Eric Adams&lt;/a&gt; added two graduating classes in November to boost the force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s an area that is desperately short of enough police,” Bratton said of subway patrols, &lt;a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/chrt.fm/track/2FE782/traffic.megaphone.fm/WABC9131687735.mp3?updated=1736004758"&gt;speaking on&lt;/a&gt; 770 WABC radio’s The “Cats Roundtable” program. “They’ve attempted to deal with that … by overtime, by surging,” or flooding a transit zone with officers as needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ex-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton says the city needs more cops to crack down on subway mayhem and other crime, noting there were thousands more officers when he was first in charge in the 1990s. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with that: One, it runs up the overtime bill. Two, it wears out the cops. And three, the cops [assigned] through overtime and surging are not familiar with the subways,” Bratton told host John Catsimatidis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bratton oversaw the transit police unit before he was commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;National Guard soldiers also now assigned to the subway &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/additional-250-national-guard-troops-will-flood-subways-to-keep-holiday-straphangers-safe-hochul-announces/"&gt;by Gov. Kathy Hochul &lt;/a&gt;are only “uniformed mannequins” who “don’t have any real powers,” Bratton added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former commish’s call for more cops on the beat comes during a rash of horrific&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt; subway violence &lt;/a&gt;that included a string of stabbings and the horrifying Dec. 22 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;torching death of a &lt;/a&gt;New Jersey straphanger on a Brooklyn F train in Coney Island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some critics of Manhattan’s new $9 congestion driving toll &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/nyc-subways-are-too-dangerous-to-slap-commuters-with-congestion-toll-labor-boss-says/"&gt;are even using the subway violence&lt;/a&gt; as an argument against the unpopular commuter tax. They are suggesting the toll should be scrapped because the alternative to taking to the roads — using mass transit — is too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bratton gave new NYPD &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/new-nypd-boss-jessica-tisch-willing-to-shake-up-status-quo-put-substance-over-palace-intrigue/"&gt;Commissioner Jessica Tisch &lt;/a&gt;a vote of confidence, saying he’s “very encouraged” that she’s clearing out the bad apples in the scandal-ridden department. She is the fourth commissioner during Adams’s three-year tenure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“There’s an area that is desperately short of enough police,” Bratton said of subway patrols. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bratton said Tisch “has what it takes to get New York back under control,” though she will face headwinds, particularly the pro-criminal laws backed by the left-leaning City Council and state Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our City Council, our legislature up in Albany, they are so far to the left it’s a wonder they haven’t fallen off the Earth. It’s going to be very problematic going into 2025,” Bratton said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he said more officers combined with creative use of modern technology can drive down crime, despite the city and state’s defendant-friendly laws.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is you need more trained police officers in the subways who can effectively take advantage of the many new technologies that are down there,” Bratton said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But once again, it comes back to ‘Keep it simple, Stupid: More cops!’ ” the ex-commissioner said. “That’s the ingredient. It’s what helped to turn it around in the ’90s. We had a lot of cops to work with … We [now] have a police commissioner and a leadership team that have a lot of great ideas, but they don’t have enough cops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A City Hall rep told The Post on Sunday that the mayor’s top priority is upping the number of police officers to 35,000 in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Our City Council, our legislature up in Albany, they are so far to the left it’s a wonder they haven’t fallen off the Earth. It’s going to be very problematic going into 2025,” Bratton said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Messerschmidt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD added in its own statement, “Increasing the number of police officers is key to further decreasing crime in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s why Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch are aggressively adding more officers to the NYPD. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This week alone, 600 additional police officers will hit the streets and the subway system; and later this month, a new class of at least 1,000 more recruits will enter the academy,” the department said. “These much-needed police officer increases are just the beginning, because additional resources are central to the strategy to drive down crime and strengthen safety across every neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subway maniac with 87 prior arrests&lt;a href="http://A%20subway%20maniac%20with%2087%20prior%20arrests%20was%20just%20busted%20for%20two%20transit%20stabbings%20%20%E2%80%94%20carrying%20the%20%E2%80%9Clarge%20knife%E2%80%99%E2%80%99%20he%20allegedly%20used%20in%20the%20violence,%20police%20and%20sources%20said%20Sunday."&gt; was just busted&lt;/a&gt; for two transit stabbings — carrying the “large knife’’ he allegedly used in the violence, police and sources said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jamar Banks — a 52-year-old with a long rap sheet and history of mental illness — was nabbed by the NYPD Warrant Squad around midnight at the 219th Street station in The Bronx and brought to the NYPD’s Transit Bureau District 2, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was carrying what had been described by police as a “large knife,” which he allegedly used in last week’s attacks, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;​Banks was last busted in November — twice for petty theft — and released with summonses to later appear in court, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surveillance video shows Banks with a large knife, cops said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​He is being held on charges of first-degree assault and third-degree weapons possession​ in last week’s straphanger stabbings, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;​The suspect looked disheveled when he was walked out of the transit district in cuffs Sunday afternoon, with his torn white jeans collapsing down his skinny legs to show his red underwear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He refused to say a word when asked about the stabbings by The Post, and he seemed dazed and overwhelmed as reporters hurled questions at him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One woman yelled out, “You’re disgusting!” as the accused was led up the subway stairs, outside and into a waiting police cruiser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alina Goldfine, a 19-year-old student at NYU Stern, was heading to the Midtown campus when she stumbled across the perp walk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s disgusting​, and he needs to be punished at whatever cost,” Goldfine told The Post, adding that​city subway crime is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s horrible,” she said. “I’m a student in New York​, and I feel very terrified to even take the subway. It makes it unaffordable for me to travel everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police were searching for Banks in connection with two subway stabbings. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks is a frequent flier on the No. 2 and No. 5 subway lines, according to a message sent to police officers before his arrest and obtained by The Post. He was nabbed at a station on the lines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officers were warned that they should use “extreme caution” approaching the suspected criminal because he might be carrying the attack weapon.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Banks was wanted for allegedly stabbing a 31-year-old man on a No. 2 train at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday after arguing with his victim, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also suspected of starting another argument with an off-duty MTA cleaner about 6 a.m. Thursday, then knifing his victim in the back and armpit on the northbound No. 6 train platform at Pelham Bay station in The Bronx, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker fled after both stabbings. Both victims were taken to hospitals in stable condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks’ rap sheet includes arrests for alleged attempted murder, weapons possession, assault, criminal trespassing, turnstile jumping and petty larceny, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re hoping it won’t be a brutal fight over this brutalist space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preservationists are pushing to landmark parts of a uniquely shaped Upper East Side building that once housed the Whitney Museum and MET Breuer before auction house Sotheby’s takes over the space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Preservationists are championing landmark status for sections of the interior of the former Upper East Side home of the Whitney Museum ahead of new owner Sotheby’s planned renovations. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christina Horsten/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The eye-catching brutalist exterior at 945 Madison Ave. is already protected because it’s within the boundaries of the Upper East Side Historic District, but the oddly shaped building’s interior can be altered in construction without the designation, activists said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a change in ownership and a change in use, we fear that portions of [architect Marcel] Breuer’s original interior could be permanently and unsympathetically altered,” architecture preservation group Docomomo US said &lt;a href="https://www.docomomo-nytri.org/news/docomomo-works-to-protect-the-interiors-of-breuers-former-whitney-museum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a statement on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The seminal interiors of this landmark — probably the best known by this Bauhaus master and among the most significant works of Modern architecture in the city—are not protected by agency oversight and currently could be inappropriately altered without recourse.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The group issued a 45-page request to the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission to landmark the building, since building a coalition of supporters that includes the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, New York Landmarks Conservancy, Preservation League of New York State and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The LPC is now considering a landmark designation for sections of the Madison Avenue lower-level, lobby, coat check, main staircase and entrance vestibule — saying in a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/lpc/designations/proposed-landmarks.page"&gt;Dec. 17 briefing&lt;/a&gt; document that the building’s “iconoclastic design is unlike anything built in New York City before or since.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The briefing described the building’s exterior as being in “stark contrast with the surrounding 19th century rowhouses” and its interior featuring “open floor plans, distinctive overhead lights, and interconnected public spaces that together create an enduring emblem of modern urban architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The renovation project is poised to preserve “the architect’s original vision while adapting it to the needs of Sotheby’s, the neighborhood, and the city today,” according to architectural firm Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The preservation push comes as Sotheby’s plans to move its headquarters to the Upper East Side building, complete with a &lt;a href="https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/news/breuer/"&gt;renovation helmed by Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The auction house bought the building from the Whitney Museum for $100 million in 2023 with plans to convert it into an auction, gallery and exhibition space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The renovation project is poised to preserve “the architect’s original vision while adapting it to the needs of Sotheby’s, the neighborhood, and the city today,” according to the firm overseeing the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A request for comment regarding how landmark status could affect the renovation plans was not immediately returned by a Sotheby’s representative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jacques Herzog said in a statement last month that the project would be approached “with respect for its original vision.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By reviving lost spaces, carefully inserting new ones and making other subtle interventions with a considered palette of materials, the building will be prepared for its new role in the auction world—and will also be more accessible again for visitors and the people of New York,” Herzog said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“With a change in ownership and a change in use, we fear that portions of Breuer’s original interior could be permanently and unsympathetically altered,” advocacy group Docomomo US said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bettmann Archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modifications are anticipated to begin later this year and be completed by this fall – but could be slowed by landmarked status, which would require any alterations to be approved by the landmarks commission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LPC Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said she was “sort of shocked” to learn the building hadn’t been landmarked at a December meeting, according to &lt;a href="https://www.6sqft.com/breuer-building-individual-interiors-landmark-designation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;6sqft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s been such an important building in this city, from a historical, cultural, architectural, personally, it’s been very important to me that I was like, ‘Oh my God, thank God we’re doing this,'” Lufty said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Similar to our work on the Park Avenue Armory project, we will be approaching the Breuer project with excitement and with respect for its original vision,” Jacques Herzog said in a statement last month. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Annie Wermiel/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The building was completed in 1966 as a larger space for the Whitney Museum, housing its modern art collection until the museum left for its current Meatpacking District site in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, it has temporarily housed collections from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (as the MET Breuer) and The Frick Museum (as the Frick Madison) during the Henry Clay Frick House renovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A public hearing on the potential landmark designation has yet to be scheduled, but is expected to be marked on the Landmark Preservation Commission calendar in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple’s new congestion pricing mandate has turned one city block into a pricey proposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single one-block stretch of First Avenue between 60th and 61st streets will now cost drivers $9 as they come off the Queensboro Bridge — even though they’re driving north and away from the zone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m shocked,” Clement Foster, a 42-year-old Bronx resident, said as he sat in his black BMW on the corner of First Avenue and 60th Street on Sunday, the first day of the controversial new toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The city’s new congestion pricing plan has made it costly to drive a single Manhattan block — even though it’s outside the toll zone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think I’d get charged here,” the Con Ed worker said. “I don’t even have E-ZPass so I’m guessing I’m paying the most. This sucks. I probably won’t come into the city for work. I’ll stay in the Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll request it,” he said. “I’ll ask my boss not to send me into Manhattan.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Cabbie Ilias Karanikolis, 41, called the whole thing “ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel bad for all the people this will hurt,” the Astoria resident said. “It will hurt all the poor people here. We don’t have business now. This will kill us. The city does whatever they want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bridge has undergone an overnight transformation thanks to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/us-news/nycs-new-9-congestion-pricing-toll-everything-you-need-need-to-know/"&gt;Albany’s new tax on driving into Midtown &lt;/a&gt;— it is no longer the only free ride into Manhattan from Queens and Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Uber driver Ali Mohammed said he hasn’t figured out how to charge passengers more due to the new toll. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The new congestion pricing mandate means the Queensboro Bridge is no longer a free ride into Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drivers motoring into Manhattan on the bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge, will get hit with the $9 toll regardless of whether they’re heading to the heart of Midtown or north to the Bronx and upstate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post on Sunday spotted one possible way around it — the 62nd Street exit off the upper deck. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How many times will they charge me,” complained Uber driver Ali Mohammed of Queens. “I don’t know how I’m going to do this, how I’m going to charge people for the additional toll today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ready. I’m not set up for this yet,” he complained. “I saw the sign yesterday but I didn’t know it would start this morning. What will they make, a million dollars a day? Where is the money going? Someone’s getting rich.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul’s congestion pricing plan, which kicked in on Sunday, charges vehicles driving into Manhattan a new toll starting at 60th Street and below from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Manhattan attorney Carlos Carbajal said his building’s parking garage empties onto 60th Street — and into the congestion pricing zone.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ilias Karankolis said the new congestion pricing toll is ‘ridiculous’ and will only hurt poor people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cars are charged $9 per day for entering the toll zone during those hours, while motorcycles pay $4.50, small trucks $14.40, and large trucks $21.60. Taxis, black cars and rideshare drivers get a bit of a break, with cabs paying 75 cents per ride and rideshare vehicles charged $1.50 per ride.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tolls go down by 75% overnight, but drivers without E-ZPass will get a notice in the mail and will pay a slightly larger fee — although it’s not clear what the exact amount will be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The money raised by the controversial plan will go to the MTA to help pay for the transit agency’s $15 billion capital plan, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for most New Yorkers it’s just another pain in the pocket — and not many are keen on using public transportation because of a recent spike in crime in the Big Apple subway system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The state’s new congestion pricing toll will pay for the MTA’s $15 billion capital plan.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing is no incentive to take the subway,” said Manhattan lawyer Carlos Carbajal — whose building’s parking garage exits onto 60th Street. “There is disincentive to take the subway. The crime and the craziness. The violence in the subway. That’s disincentivized me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On the weekends, maybe I’ll consider the subway, if it’s just me,” he said. “But with all the craziness, with all the violent subway crime, I’m being disincentivized. Especially if I have my wife with me or my daughter. I’m really being disincentivized to take the subway on the weekends.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Carbajal said he might be looking for a new home — for his car. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m considering moving my car out of my building’s garage, to a garage a block or two north, maybe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hardworking fruit stand seller so savagely beaten that his family needed to cover his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/nyc-fruit-vendor-dad-of-3-fatally-beaten-with-baseball-bat-in-cold-hearted-apparently-unprovoked-attack-cops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bashed-in head with a fedora&lt;/a&gt; at his funeral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An innocent 29-year-old dad excited for his daughter’s upcoming third birthday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/03/us-news/innocent-bystander-fatally-stabbed-in-violent-nyc-road-rage-fight-leaving-his-shattered-family-reeling/"&gt;murdered by a vicious gangbanger.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An autistic, obsessive compulsive man &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/metro/autistic-man-stabbed-to-death-over-backpack-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bleeding out in his lobby&lt;/a&gt; after inadvertently moving his killer’s backpack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These were some of the crimes in the NYPD’s deadliest precinct in 2024 — the Bronx’s 46th Precinct — which saw 27 homicides and 65 people shot, leaving cops calling for more resources and locals afraid to walk the blood-soaked streets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The precinct — which oversees troubled neighborhoods Fordham, University Heights, Morris Heights and Mount Hope — faced a staggering 107.7% surge in homicides and bumps in other major crimes from the previous year, according to NYPD data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The deadly 46th Precinct recorded the most amount of homicides in 2024.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“If you bump into someone, they want to kill you,” said Ronaysi Gomez, 25, whose innocent bystander brother, Ronald Gomez-Mesa, 29, was fatally stabbed in Morris Heights on July 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now we don’t have any safety. We don’t know when we are ever getting home safe because right now everything is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is just horrible,” she said about the skyrocketing murder rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How can we live this way? This is not what we want to live with.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ronald Gomez-Mesa, an innocent bystander, was fatally stabbed in Morris Heights on July 2.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Family photo obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gomez’s fears are punctuated by surging crime in the area covered by the 46th station house. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the precinct, major crimes were up in every category — murder (107.7%), rape (54.5%), robbery (9.1%), felony assault (10.9%), burglary (28.9%) and grand larceny (21.2%) — except grand larceny auto, according to the NYPD data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bullets flew, with some 65 victims shot in 50 incidents of gunplay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crime was up in every major category except grand larceny auto. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lower crime rates in other parts of the Big Apple has done little to soothe the Gomez family’s fear and grief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been hearing that the crime rate is going down, but I haven’t been seeing it,” the younger sister told The Post after the heartbroken, tight-knit family spent the holidays without Ronald — who lived with his parents, Ronaysi and her kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Months earlier, Ronald Gomez-Mesa was seated outside the Jason Deli and Grocery on West Tremont Avenue and Phelan Place when a woman and man got into a fender bender, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A memorial for Ronald Gomez-Mesa, one of the 27 homicide victims killed in the 46th Precinct in 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jack Morphet / NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman then called Clement Boateng, an alleged member of the River Park Towers gang who had four past arrests, including one for gun possession from Sept. 22, 2016, sources told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boateng, 35, showed up and randomly attacked unsuspecting witnesses after a man chucked something at him and drove off, wild surveillance video showed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An enraged Boateng then lunged at two men nearby, including Gomez-Mesa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim fought back before Boateng allegedly plunged a knife into his chest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surveillance footage captured Clement Boateng allegedly killing Ronald Gomez-Mesa. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a week before Gomez-Mesa was killed, he passed his TLC driver’s license exam — and hoped to use it to provide for his daughter Rosalia, who was set to turn 3-years old a few weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He couldn’t even enjoy spending her birthday with him,” Ronaysi said, adding the murder has crushed her mother. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mile and a half away, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/nyc-fruit-vendor-dad-of-3-fatally-beaten-with-baseball-bat-in-cold-hearted-apparently-unprovoked-attack-cops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fruit vendor Leslie Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, 56, was beaten to death with a baseball bat during an unprovoked attack while working at his selling spot on East Fordham Road near the Grand Concourse on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanchez, a father of two, was left so badly battered that his family said they placed a fedora on his head in the casket to hide the bruising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His heartbroken widow, Maciel Vasquez, called his killing an “injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My husband was a good man. He wasn’t a problematic person,” she told The Post after police arrested her husband’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/us-news/heartbroken-widow-of-slain-bronx-fruit-vendor-speaks-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;accused attackers&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom had prior arrests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fruit vendor Leslie Sanchez was bashed in the head with a baseball bat in an unprovoked attack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am asking the police and the governor to please do their job,” she begged. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement experts and Bronx cops who spoke with The Post blamed the high crime rates on bail reform, cops fleeing the department in recent years and a lack of patrolling. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I am asking the police and the governor to please do their job,” widow Maciel Vasquez pleaded. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tomas E.Gaston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s an impoverished area so we are just depleted,” Michael Alcazar, a former NYPD detective and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told The Post. “We just can’t saturate areas with law enforcement when we normally could.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t have police officers, then crime will just spike,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Bronx cop said some nights only two or three cars patrol the entire vast precinct.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are no cops to patrol the precinct,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The criminals know there are no cops riding around so they don’t have a problem carrying guns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councilman Oswald Feliz (D-Bronx), whose part of the district overlaps the 46th, called for more police in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/24/us-news/nyc-council-member-calls-for-more-cops-in-his-bronx-district-to-deal-with-rising-violent-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;September letter&lt;/a&gt; to then-interim police commissioner Tom Donlon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He argued parts of the Bronx were “left behind” as violence soared. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those aren’t just numbers; they also represent families traumatized by the horrors of violence,” Felix told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need more cops in these communities, and must also think about laws that are allowing individuals to terrorize our communities this way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Law enforcement experts and Bronx cops blamed the troubling rise in murders on lack of police.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, Mayor Eric Adams announced a pilot program dubbed “&lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/905-24/mayor-adams-pilot-program-improve-quality-life-persistently-high-crime-areas-#/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Every Block Counts&lt;/a&gt;,” which directs multi-agency resources to specific streets in Brooklyn’s 73rd Precinct and the Bronx’s 46th, which saw the most amount of shootings citywide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The administration said not a single shooting or shots fired incident happened along three Bronx’s thoroughfares — Morris Avenue, Elm Place and Walton Avenue — since the launch of the program in October. That compared to four shootings and shots fired incidents in 2023, according to the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One Bronx cop said the program, like others in the past, will do little to change out of control violence committed by gangbangers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This place has been ridden with crime for over 30 years. Politicians have been promising to provide services forever,” he railed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Same story, everyone makes promises and nothing happens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the NYPD said cops perform “enhanced patrols” in high crimes areas in the precinct through “precision policing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the 46th precinct, the NYPD has identified specific crime reduction zones where officers perform enhanced patrols in higher crime areas to root out violence and disorder,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The NYPD is also taking alleged assailants off the streets, and has made 29 homicide arrests in the 46 — an increase of 163.6% — while overall arrests are up 19.4%.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the arrests, the mayhem has locals feeling rattled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[It’s] really, really bad,” said Gabby Almonte, who was visiting her mom in Mount Hope. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because you be walking and you don’t know if you’re going to get home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man was stabbed in a Bronx train station early Sunday, mere hours after congestion pricing went into effect, forcing more New Yorkers into the increasingly violent subway system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if the victim and suspect knew each other or what prompted the attack, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 38-year-old man was sliced in the arm inside the Third Avenue and 138th Street No. 6 express station in Mott Haven just before 4 a.m., police sources told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It was not immediately clear if the victim and suspect knew each other or what prompted the attack, police sources said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dakota Santiago/FreedomNewsTV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attacker fled the station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim was taken to a nearby hospital in stable condition, police said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident comes amid days of disturbing violence on New York City subways, including the horrifying arson &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;death of 57-year-old Debrina Kawam&lt;/a&gt; of Toms River, NJ, at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station in Brooklyn. Kawam was allegedly set ablaze by illegal migrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, who is now being held on first-degree murder charges.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;There were at least five attacks in the days after Kawam’s heartbreaking death, including the stabbing of an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/mta-worker-stabbed-at-bronx-subway-station/"&gt;MTA staffer heading to work in The Bronx&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday at the Pelham Parkway station. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt;Four other straphangers were slashed&lt;/a&gt; on consecutive days in the past week, too: a 52-year-old man knifed in the arm at the Myrtle-Wyckoff L train station in Brooklyn; a 48-year-old man slashed in the neck at the West 50th Street and Eighth Avenue station in Manhattan and two others on New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the latter two incidents, a 30-year-old man was cut in the arm during a dispute with another commuter at the 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway station in Manhattan, and a 31-year-old man was stabbed in the back at the 14th Street station in Manhattan just 15 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim was taken to a nearby hospital in stable condition, police said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dakota Santiago/FreedomNewsTV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The incident comes amid days of disturbing violence on New York City subways. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dakota Santiago/FreedomNewsTV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/straphanger-shoved-into-path-of-subway-train-idd-as-nyc-music-programmer-joseph-lynskey/"&gt;music programmer Joseph Lynskey&lt;/a&gt;, 45, was apparently randomly pushed in front of a Manhattan No. 1 train&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and miraculously managed to escape with his life&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased violence has prompted the Guardian Angels, the city’s volunteer vigilante watchdog group, to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;resume patrols in the subways&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2020 — and at levels not seen since their inception in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of New York City’s firefighter unions are slamming the newly implemented &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/us-news/nycs-new-9-congestion-pricing-toll-everything-you-need-need-to-know/"&gt;$9 congestion toll plan&lt;/a&gt;, saying Sunday that it will likely hurt response times —  which “could mean a difference between life and death.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FDNY firefighters came out against the scheme on Sunday, just as drivers began getting charged for entering Manhattan below 61st Street. The toll is $9 during peak hours — from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends — and $2.25 for off-peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York’s Bravest warned the new tolls could delay emergency response time as firefighters will no longer use their cars to quickly get around the city, and instead be forced to try and navigate more congested streets in firetrucks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two of NYC’s firefighter unions have come out against the newly implemented congestion toll, warning it will impact response time.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fire engines and fire trucks will be delayed because the FDNY will have to use those vehicles to move firefighters around the city because firefighters that will no longer bring their cars into the zone will have no other way to get to a different work location with their gear,” said Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased traffic congestion north of 60th Street will likely also lead to slower response times, which “could mean the difference between life and death,” according to Ansbro. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“This is not just a logistical issue — it’s a public health crisis in the making,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association (UFOA) also slammed the economic impact congestion pricing will have on New Yorkers, with the change likely to cost residents millions annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing will burden residents with millions in added costs annually. It’s an unfair tax that doesn’t account for the critical needs of emergency services,” UFOA President James Brosi said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Congestion toll pricing went into effect Sunday at midnight.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Increased traffic could be the difference “between life and death,” Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro says. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both unions are urging city officials to consider exemptions to the plan for emergency services, warning the current structure puts New Yorkers’ lives at risk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing should not come at the expense of public safety ,” both leaders said in a joint statement. “We urge city and state officials to address these critical concerns before implementing a policy that puts every New Yorker at risk.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion of the Bridge and Tunnel crowd won’t just be on weekends anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commuters to the Big Apple will be turning neighborhoods across the city into their own personal parking lots beginning this week, ditching their rides to save their wallets because of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/us-news/nycs-new-9-congestion-pricing-toll-everything-you-need-need-to-know/"&gt;$9 congestion pricing plan&lt;/a&gt;, concerned residents told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plan is expected to upend neighborhoods closest to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/05/us-news/hochuls-9-nyc-congestion-tolls-set-to-roll-out-jan-5/"&gt;60th Street tolling zone&lt;/a&gt; with nightmarish gridlock as a surge of drivers begin scouring for free parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Neighborhoods closest to the 60th Street tolling zone are expected to be upended with nightmarish gridlock once the tolling scheme takes effect. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parking is already very much an issue. We have nine hospitals in our district, and many of them are north of 60th Street,” said Upper East Sider Valerie Mason, a member of New Yorkers Against Congestion Pricing Tax, a group suing to stop the scheme.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital workers and visitors already eat up the majority of the nabe’s street parking, she added. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“We’re also very concerned that [the toll] will cause a huge amount of traffic and more cars trying to park north of the [59th Street Bridge],” Mason said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Upper West Side and Harlem are also expected to get slammed — a problem when parking spaces are already a precious commodity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cars exit the Lincoln Tunnel underneath the new Congestion Toll scanners on Jan. 5, 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“We’re also very concerned that [the toll] will cause a huge amount of traffic and more cars trying to park north of the [59th Street Bridge],” said Upper East Sider Valerie Mason. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;East Harlem is already plagued by congestion from out-of-town traffic taking up parking spots before heading south in the borough — because it’s faster than using the FDR Drive, said Xavier Santiago, chairman of Manhattan Community Board 11. He predicted the parking crisis “will continue to escalate” with congestion pricing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outer boroughs are also panicking. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Communities such as Long Island City in Queens, the South Bronx, and ritzy Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill and Park Slope in Brooklyn are fearing their quality of life will be uprooted – not only by their own drivers but also those schlepping to the Big Apple from New Jersey, upstate New York, Long Island and Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“My constituents who still have no real public transit connection to Manhattan are looking forward to treating the posh, transit-rich, gentrified, brownstone Brooklyn as their new park-and-ride,” quipped NYC Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island). &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New Congestion toll signage hangs outside the Lincoln Tunnel at W 41st near 9th Ave on Jan. 5, 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My constituents who still have no real public transit connection to Manhattan are looking forward to treating the posh, transit-rich, gentrified, brownstone Brooklyn as their new park-and-ride,” quipped NYC Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island), when asked about the tolling scheme pushed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and other left wing Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Borelli and other critics of the plan claim it will bring more air and noise pollution to the outer boroughs – &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/06/metro/uft-paying-costs-of-staten-island-congestion-pricing-fight/"&gt;including parts of The Bronx and Staten Island &lt;/a&gt;— as drivers look to avoid the toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Giuliano, a professor specializing in urban transportation at USC’s Price School of Public Policy, expects motorists to spend the next few months “experimenting” with new routes to decide whether they’re better off paying the tolls, relying on mass transit or chasing free parking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Can you imagine doing” a drive-to-subway commute “every day?” said Giuliano. “Because some days the parking spots might be there; other days they might not.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“They’re creating less congestion in Manhattan [with the tolls] and more congestion everywhere else,” said Jim Walden, a white-collar running for mayor. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, many commuters want to spend as little time as possible on NYC’s crime-ridden subway system — warned Jim Walden, a lawyer running for mayor — so expect them to relentlessly drive around the outer boroughs looking for prized parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My friends on the far left really don’t care about the outer boroughs,” said Walden, a moderate independent. “They’re creating less congestion in Manhattan [with the tolls] and more congestion everywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Freed, a retired state Supreme Court justice and former Lower East Side councilwoman, is expecting the worst. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are going to do whatever they can to avoid [the toll],” Freed said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“People are going to do whatever they can to avoid [the toll],” warned Kathryn Freed, a retired state Supreme Court judge and former Lower East Side councilwoman. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that means a toll camera on 1st Avenue between East 60 and 61st streets could bring traffic chaos. Motorists getting off the Queensboro Bridge planning to head north will be hit with a charge if they take the lower level to 1st Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; But the upper exit to East 62nd street will bypass the charge — creating a potential choke point as drivers try to avoid the toll.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, online entrepreneurs have long been hawking license-plate covers for motorists trying to dodge toll machines and traffic cameras, but the state-run MTA has warned it plans to crack down harder on rogue riders once congestion pricing is in effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is at least one cheat code available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video shared on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/06/us-news/risky-tiktok-hack-exposes-way-to-avoid-congestion-pricing-camera/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; in April exposed a potential hack to beat a toll camera on West End Avenue by driving the wrong way through a one-way, one lane parking garage on the toll-zone border — with an entrance on 60th Street and an exit on 61st Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manager at the Sessanta Garage, who identified himself as “Sergio,” told The Post the business “is aware of the issue” and plans to eventually install barricades to avoid “head-on collisions” involving toll evaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve just been waiting to see if this congestion pricing really goes into effect or not,” he said last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chaos underground spread to the commuter rails Saturday, as a Metro-North rider was stabbed in the chest over an argument about noisy music while a train arrived in Grand Central.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack happened at about 7 p.m. on a New Haven line Metro-North train arriving at the station, according to the MTAPD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abdul Malik Little, 46, was playing music over his phone’s speaker and took exception when a 31-year-old fellow rider complained about the racket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little stabbed the unidentified 31-year-old man in the chest twice with a knife as the train pulled into Grand Central, the MTAPD says.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim was strong enough to exit the train at the station and identify his attacker to police who were patrolling the platform.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Those patrolmen apprehended Little at the scene without incident and recovered a knife during the arrest, MTAPD reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital with injuries that are considered non-life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Little, from Jamaica, NY, is charged with Attempted Murder, Felony Assault, and Criminal Possession of a Weapon, the MTAPD says.&lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The attack happened at about 7 p.m. on a New Haven line Metro North train arriving in the station, according to the MTAPD. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the second stabbing in as many weeks in Grand Central and comes on the tail of a series of horrifying crimes underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, suspect Jason Sargeant allegedly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/maniac-charged-in-alleged-christmas-eve-stabbing-of-two-people-at-grand-central-terminal/"&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; a man on the wrist and a woman in the neck during a mad dash through Grand Central, according to the NYPD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Dec 22, a woman riding the F train was set on fire and burned to death by an illegal Guatemalan migrant, who torched her clothes, fanned the flames, and watched 57-year-old Debrina Kawam die at the Coney-Island Stillwell Avenue train stop, cops say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/guatemalan-migrant-accused-of-torching-sleeping-woman-on-nyc-subway-indicted-on-murder-and-arson-charges/"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil&lt;/a&gt;, 33, was indicted on first and second-degree murder charges and one count of arson for the attack. He is due back in court on Jan 7.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On New Year’s Eve, one straphanger was pushed in front of an oncoming 1 train at 18th Street in Chelsea in a shocking caught-on-tape attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This alarming rise in high-profile subway crime has caused the Guardian Angels to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;dust off the red berets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curtis Sliwa, Angel’s founder and former mayoral candidate, announced earlier this week that the anti-crime brigade would be resuming patrols of the city subway system for the first time since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have to increase our numbers, increase the training and increase our presence as we did back in 1979,” Sliwa said at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station in Brooklyn last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorists heading into some of Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods have begun shelling out a first-in-the-nation $9 congestion toll — a controversial levy critics contend will drive people out of Gotham and devastate the local economy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme officially took&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/mta-gets-ok-to-start-9-manhattan-congestion-toll-following-ruling-hochul-calls-it-massive-win-for-commuters/"&gt; effect &lt;/a&gt;at midnight on Sunday, meaning drivers entering the city below 60th Street will now have to pay $9 during peak hours — 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends — and $2.25 for off-peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During peak hours, large trucks will pay $21.60, small trucks $14.40 and motorcycles $4.50.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Motorists heading into Lower and Midtown Manhattan are now forced to shell out a first-in-the-nation $9 congestion toll. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the first motorists to pay the toll, a man who declined to give his name, seem resigned to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing we can do. They already decided, there’s nothing we can do,” he said, after going through a toll reader near the Lincoln Tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Another driver, when informed he had just missed the last chance to enter Manhattan congestion-toll-free declared: “Right now ?!” “Ahhhh.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Saturday drivers ripped the plan and trashed Gov. Kathy Hochul, hours before the scheme went into effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We pay a lot of money to live in this formerly wonderful city, that has taken some hits recently, and I think it’s terrible to be charging people that pay taxes who live here extra money when they cross 61st St,” said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Samantha Popper, a 44-year-old stay-at-home-mom who lives nearby.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s infuriating that in just another day we’ll be charged a hefty toll just to cross 61st, which is just in my neighborhood,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her message to Gov. Kathy Hochul: “work a lot harder” to keep New Yorkers here and don’t “try to run them out of the city by up-charging them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Anderson, a 42-year-old information technology specialist, said he lived in the city for over a decade but moved to New Jersey five years ago after being clocked in the face and knocked unconscious while reading a book on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drivers entering the city below 60th Street will now have pay $9 during peak hours. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he moved specifically to avoid using mass transit but now realizes that might no longer be an option financially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ll probably will be taking NJ Transit more often, and that’s no fun,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Otherwise, it’s gonna cost me $30 to $40 just to get to the other side of the Hudson.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lyft driver Jose Siera ripped the scheme as a “money grab.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The tolls are going up also, bridges, they’re raising the prices also. It’s gonna suck,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The congestion pricing plan officially took effect at midnight on Sunday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Uber driver Luigi said “the whole thing is a scam” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are not going to be driving their vehicles into the city,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The taxi drivers, the Uber drivers, we are gonna put this cost on them  — so you are punishing them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul and the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority raced against the clock to impose the toll   before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. He has ripped congestion pricing as the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/trump-slams-hochul-move-to-revive-nyc-congestion-tax/"&gt;“most regressive tax known to womankind.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump joins the 51% of New Yorkers opposed to the controversial tax, while 29% support it, and another 20% are unsure, according to a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/most-new-yorkers-loathe-kathy-hochuls-congestion-toll-eye-opening-poll-says/"&gt;Siena College poll &lt;/a&gt;earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drivers are seen at the exit of the Lincoln Tunnel on Jan 5, 2025 — the first day of Congestion pricing for cars coming into Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This cash grab will only hurt commuters’ wallets and our local economy, and I’m already hearing from tons of people who say they’ll never go to Manhattan again, which will certainly have an impact on restaurants, the theater and small business,” said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA claims the tolls are necessary to reduce pollution caused by gridlock and to raise $15 billion for mass transit upgrades, such as extending the Second Avenue subway, signal improvements and buying hundreds of new electric buses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency is providing a $3 credit for passenger cars with EZPass that enter the toll zone through the Lincoln, Queens-Midtown, Hugh L. Carey or Holland tunnels during peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drivers earning less than $50,000 can apply for a 50% discount for all trips after the first 10 in a calendar month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The architects hope the plan will push more drivers to use public transit — but the rollout comes after 10 people were murdered in the subway system last year.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opponents such as Susan Lee urged the MTA to first modernize the system and make it safer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I try to only go on the subway during rush hour because it’s not safe,” said Lee, a Chinatown activist and president of New Yorkers Against Congestion Pricing Tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $9 “entry fee” would devastate Chinatown and other toll-zone neighborhoods such as Little Italy and the Lower East Side by driving up delivery costs and making travel too expensive for customers, she warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the scheme has been met with fierce opposition by working-class commuters — including teachers and cops, firefighters and other first responders — who say they will unfairly have to bear the financial cost of the added tolls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s at least 10 pending lawsuits opposing congestion tolling, but experts have said it’ll be more difficult to put the brakes on it once it’s up and running. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Friday shot down New Jersey’s emergency request to stop the new tolling program, and an appellate panel upheld the rejection Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The congestion tolls began slamming drivers the same day the Port Authority also raised prices for its bridges and tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most vehicles, the new PA tolls will go up from $15.38 to $16.06 during peak hours, and $18.31 without E-ZPass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Including congestion tolls, driver traveling into Manhattan from New Jersey through the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels will ultimately have to shell out $22.06 during peak hours and $31.81 if they don’t have E-ZPass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul abruptly paused the program before it was set to launch in June with a $15 toll following outcry from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and other pols who said it could doom Democratic candidates in suburban House seats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She waited until after November’s general election before caving into the demands of car-hating environmental groups and other extremists before pushing her reduced $9 tolling scheme, which is scheduled to jump to $12 for most vehicles in 2028 and $15 in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tolls are the first of their kind in the U.S, but London and some other cities around the world have rolled out similar programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MTA held a cheery celebration to unveil a new “Congestion Relief Zone” sign in Manhattan, just hours before drivers will feel the pain as the controversial toll goes into effect in the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency’s CEO Janno Lieber seemed to have no concern for the many lawsuits and pleas from commuters aiming to stop the new $9 toll, as he personally unveiled a toll sign Saturday at one of the entry points to the zone at Broadway and W. 61st St.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video shared by the MTA on social media shows a small crowd of toll supporters and elected officials cheering Lieber as he stood in a crane and revealed the new price sign.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Despite the cheers, the celebration drew online  jeers from opponents of the toll — which begins at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do you cheer for this,” one person commented on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another wrote: “Who’s celebrating bro… like who is happy to pay more ugh.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some found the tone of the celebration distasteful in light of the financial strain it will  put on many commuters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We ain’t happy about this, just put the sign up and go about y’all day. No unveiling necessary,” another Instagram user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the criticism, Lieber took time to boast last Saturday about the contentious plan as something that will improve safety, pollution and traffic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working on this for five years but if you stand in Midtown for five minutes you know we have to deal with the traffic problem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now we’re showing the world that in New York we do something about our challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorists will be charged $2.25 during all other times to enter Manhattans’ busiest neighborhoods south of 60th Street. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tolls for those not using an E-Zpass will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new congestion pricing will be the first of its kind in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Money generated by the toll is expected to provide $15 billion toward MTA capital projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone’s in cannabliss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner of a marijuana dispensary in the Big Apple is on a financial high after his budding business raked in about $7 million in sales last year – nearly two decades after he was locked up for selling weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everything that really made me where I’m at right now is showing up every single day and putting in that work whether I had to clean the floor or the sidewalk or wipe something down or pick something up,” Coss Marte, the founder and CEO of ConBud, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/04/conbud-founder-from-drug-sentence-to-building-nyc-cannabis-dispensary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told CNBC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Coss Marte went from convict to entrepreneur.   &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was just showing up. We don’t take days off. I work 365-days a year. I love the hustle. I love the grind. I love the work.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marte, who was busted on a drug conviction in 2009 that landed him a seven-year prison sentence, now projects his booming business will bring in $12 million this year, boasting an $800,000 monthly profit, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marte’s cannabis store ConBud located in the Lower East Side.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ConBud, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/11/metro/hashing-out-nycs-confusing-illicit-cannabis-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one of the first businesses fully-licensed &lt;/a&gt;to sell recreational cannabis in Manhattan and the first in the city’s Lower East Side, sells various ganja goodies, with prices ranging from $10 to $700.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pot proprietor had his conviction expunged in 2021 when New York legalized adult-use weed and announced a year later that entrepreneurs with cannabis convictions on their records or their families could receive recreational marijuana licenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marte greeting a customer at his shop. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marte opened his first location on Delancey and Orchard Streets in October 2023 and has since expanded his growing business to The Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was following this law, and what they required was two years of a net profitable business and a conviction on your record,” Marte said, the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now how many people have that to qualify for a cannabis license? Not many.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thirteen licenses &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/21/new-york-issues-first-recreational-weed-licenses-to-ex-convicts-families/"&gt;were awarded to entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; with arrest records in the city in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marte initially&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2015/03/30/meet-the-ex-con-whose-prison-inspired-workout-is-taking-over-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; gained a huge following after launching a no-frills, prison-style boot camp&lt;/a&gt; upon his release from prison in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marte’s shop did $7 million in business in 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While serving his four-year prison term at Greene Correctional Facility in upstate New York, a doctor warned Marte he would die within years if he didn’t take better care of himself. Marte lost 70 lbs. behind bars and eventually turned his work-out routine into a business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marte launched ConBody and opened his own studio in January 2016 at Broome and Eldridge streets — the same corner where he once sold drugs starting when he was 13-years-old — and hired fellow ex-cons as trainers, maintenance and customer-service workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former dealer has adhered to that hiring practice since opening his cannabis shop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t believe I work here everyday,” a ConBud employee told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Marte served four years at Greene Correctional Facility. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I come in and get an actual tax-paying check for selling marijuana. It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legal cannabis industry in New York &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/legal-cannabis-shops-in-ny-will-soar-to-sky-high-625-in-2025-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is expected to soar in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, with state regulators projecting the number of new licensed pot stores will more than double from 275 to more than 625. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, consumers purchased more than $840 million in legal ganja. When factoring in sales from 2023, the legal market has exceeded the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/24/us-news/ny-smokin-it-with-pot-sales-nears-1-billion-mark/"&gt;milestone of $1 billion &lt;/a&gt;in total sales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Office of Cannabis Management said sales this year could exceed $1.5 billion, or about double last year’s haul while law enforcement will expand efforts to padlock illegal stores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big, big community that’s growing with us,” Marte told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An East Harlem man was slapped with second-degree murder and assault charges for allegedly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/15-year-old-boy-killed-another-teen-injured-in-possible-gang-related-nyc-shooting/"&gt;fatally stabbing a teen boy&lt;/a&gt; during a heated dispute in Manhattan, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The violence started just after 6 p.m. near East 108th St. and Second Ave., where cops say two men and a teenager were arguing about an unknown subject when the dispute turned physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third man, 22, was stabbed in the left arm and Sanchez, 62, sustained a cut on his forehead. Both men were taken to local hospitals in stable condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanchez, who also faces a weapon possession charge, was arrested Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds were killed on New Jersey roads in 2024 — marking the deadliest year in more than three decades for pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A jaw-dropping 221 pedestrians were fatally struck in traffic collisions across the Garden State last year, with most concentrated in Essex County, &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/njsp/info/fatalacc/pdf/ptccr_24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state police data shows.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The death toll is 29% higher than it was in 2023, and is the highest on record since 1988 — when 239 pedestrians were killed.&lt;/p&gt;

pedestrians were killed on New Jersey roads in 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Toa55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall traffic-related deaths in New Jersey also jumped in 2024 — with at least 687 people losing their lives on Jersey roadways. That accounts for a 13.4% spike over 2023, when 76 fewer fatal and nonfatal accidents occurred.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data also shows that 359 of those killed in 2024 were drivers and 82 were classified as passengers. Another 25 were cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragic totals for 2024 fall just two deaths short of matching 2022 numbers, which marked a 15-year high for fatalities at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the numbers dipped in 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/njsp/information/pdf/fcr/2023_fatal_crash_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;newly released data shows&lt;/a&gt; that there was a surge in drivers testing positive for alcohol, marijuana or other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new year is also off to a rough start, with two deaths in two separate accidents already in 2025, according to the data. One is classified as a driver and the other as a pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman claimed she was fired from celebrity chef &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/30/iron-chef-david-burke-to-open-his-first-nyc-restaurant-in-nearly-three-years/"&gt;David Burke&lt;/a&gt;‘s Red Horse restaurant after complaining about sexual harassment from a sous chef and an investor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michelle Provost, the former general manager at the Iron Chef’s place in Rumson, claimed in a lawsuit she was subject to an “unbearably toxic work environment rife with sexual harassment, gender discrimination and retaliation,” &lt;a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2025/01/03/red-horse-by-david-burke-general-manager-sexually-harassed/77323659007/?utm_source=app-newsalert-strada&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsalert&amp;amp;utm_term=hero&amp;amp;utm_content=papp-asburypark-nletter04" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Asbury Park Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chef David Burke posing at one of his restaurants, David Burke Townhouse, in Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the restaurant’s investors offered to pay Provost for sexual favors. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael L. Diamond / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Provost claimed a sous chef named Rafael pestered her for dates, and tried to kiss her before dragging her into one of the restaurant’s bathrooms — releasing her only when someone else entered, the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sous chef allegedly openly talked about Provost’s breasts with other workers, while an investor kissed her and offered her and another female employee cash for a sexual favor, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In September, Provost was apparently punched in the ribs while &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/28/us-news/diner-lunges-with-steak-knife-in-fight-over-spilled-wine-at-nj-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;breaking up a fight&lt;/a&gt; between two customers — one of whom was brandishing a knife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was fired in October after taking three days off to recover from a fever, Provost contended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not college,” she claimed Burke told her, according to the outlet. “It’s not high school, it’s not college, get over it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Burke has his own flatware and cookware lines, and has written cook books. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J. Scott Wynn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The suit named Mach Rest, LLC, which does business as Red Horse by David Burke, as well as Burke, the Asbury Park Press said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burke, who makes regular television appearances, also has published cookbooks and sells his own signature flatware and cookware. He could not immediately be reached by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burke told the Asbury Park Press Friday he had not seen the suit. He emphasized he personally wasn’t accused of sexual harassing Provost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell you anything else, but remind you it’s an allegation,” Burke said. “We run a tight business, and we have many of them. This is something we have to sort through and unpack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A creepy new video exposes the full face of the knife-wielding maniac who viciously stabbed postal worker Ray Hodges to death in a Harlem deli this week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Troubled transgender woman Jaia Cruz is seen up close rolling her eyes and smiling seductively in &lt;a href="https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1875349181050843163" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;a nine-second video&lt;/a&gt;, while a song blasts the raunchy lyrics, “I’m such a wh-re, but I’m not a hoe,” in the background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jaia Cruz is seen rolling her eyes and smiling seductively in the raunchy, nine-second-long video posted to X Friday. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cruz is facing murder charges in the fatal stabbing of postal worker Ray Hodges at a Harlem deli Thursday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if the X user, @ImMeme0, who posted the video Friday, is affiliated with the 24-year-old Cruz — who is now facing murder charges for Hodge’s cold-blooded killing Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, two members of Hodge’s grieving family declined to speak to The Post — only saying they’re “not doing well.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old USPS worker and father-of-two was grabbing lunch at Joe’s Deli Grocery at 168 Lenox Ave. when he and Cruz started arguing while in line, bodega employees previously told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cruz quickly became enraged, spit in Hodge’s face and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/knife-wielding-sicko-spit-on-nyc-postal-worker-before-knifing-him-in-horrific-deli-murder/"&gt;gutted him in the stomach&lt;/a&gt;, police said. He was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where he died, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 36-year-old USPS worker and father-of-two was grabbing lunch at the deli at 168 Lenox Ave. when Cruz allegedly killed him. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stacy Rice/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before the heinous Harlem slaying &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/woman-accused-of-stabbing-postal-worker-over-spot-in-nyc-deli-line-has-long-history-of-knife-violence/"&gt;Cruz had a rap sheet with five arrests&lt;/a&gt;, including once in July 2020 for waving an open box cutter at a person in Midtown West and shouting “I’m going to cut him,” according to police sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When cops ordered the combative Cruz to the ground, she refused and was later busted for resisting arrest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cruz and Hodges argued before Cruz became enraged, spit in Hodge’s face, and gutted him in the stomach, police said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, she was nabbed again for a tag-team robbery at knifepoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers might be seeing some snowflakes on Monday, but southern New Jersey is about to get socked by a major storm moving east from the central states. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple could see 1 to 3 inches of snow, while the southern part of the Garden State is facing 5 to 8 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Southern New Jersey should be in the thick of it by Monday morning. People going to work will be seeing snowflakes,” Fox Weather meteorologist Cody Braud told The Post Saturday. “But I don’t think they will be dealing with any accumulating snow until the midday and afternoon hours.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting late Sunday night, the storm will hit cities further south like Washington D.C. and Baltimore, and then “will slowly keep nudging north and east hour by hour,” Braud said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you get further south of the mid-Atlantic, that’s where the bigger snow totals are going to be,” he predicted. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“In New York City, Long Island and northern New Jersey, we are on that fine line, where we can see anything from nothing, to a coating of snow, to potentially that 1 to 3 inches,” Braud added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures will be in the mid- to upper-20s at night, with the wind chill potentially making it feel like 20. Highs in the region are expected to remain right around the freezing line for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snow could end as early as the midday hours, or may stay “all day and into the overnight hours into Tuesday,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A different storm in Upstate New York, meanwhile, is expected to bring up to 16 inches of “lake effect” snow overnight Saturday into midday Sunday to the Syracuse and Utica areas, the National Weather Service said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYPD has released new photos of the gun-wielding foursome suspected of opening fire on a group outside of a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/at-least-10-wounded-in-mass-shooting-outside-queens-nightclub-sources/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;Queens nightclub on New Year’s Day&lt;/a&gt;, injuring 10 young people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one image, a gunman appears to be firing at the victims outside of Amazura Concert Hall in Jamaica, where a memorial was being held for a slain Brooklyn teen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another, a suspect was seen pointing a gun toward the ground and reloading it with both hands, while a third was captured carrying a firearm at his waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A total of 30 bullets were fired into the crowd standing outside of Amazura Concert Hall in Jamaica, Queens, on Wednesday evening, cops said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Mecea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 30 bullets were fired into the crowd, with the victims ranging in age between 16 and 19, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All victims were taken to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers ran before piling into a white sedan and speeding off, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no arrests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There have been no arrests.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;DCPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More than 100 people had gathered at the Amazura Concert Hall on Wednesday evening to remember 16-year-old Taearion Mungo, who was shot dead in Brooklyn Oct. 26, according to police sources.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are investigating whether the shooting was a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/gang-grudge-may-have-sparked-mass-shooting-outside-nyc-nightclub-during-memorial-for-slain-teen-sources/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;gang-related hit, police sources told The Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 100 people, most of them teenagers, had gathered at the nightclub to remember 16-year-old Taearion Mungo, who was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/us-news/boy-16-shot-dead-at-nyc-housing-complex-as-youth-violence-engulfs-city/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;shot dead at the Walt Whitman Houses&lt;/a&gt; in Fort Greene Oct. 26, according to sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mungo may have been affiliated with the FNO street gang — or the “For N—ers Only” crew — which may have prompted the shooting outside the nightclub, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayor Adams and Gov. Hochul condemned teen violence and illegal firearms in statements after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are asking the public for any information about the four suspects. Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

&lt;p&gt;As the only Native American in her Brooklyn neighborhood, Murielle Borst Tarrant’s stoop was her sanctuary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant grew up on Degraw Street between Court and Smith streets in 1970s Red Hook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The whole neighborhood was Italian,” she explained, but the Smith Street area was considered a Puerto Rican enclave. Being neither ethnicity, she was often mistaken for both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tarrant, pictured here at her childhood home, was raised in Red Hook in the 1970s. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erica Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’d go down one block to one candy store, and the Puerto Ricans thought you were an Italian and you’d get chased down the block,” she recalled. “And so I would go to another candy store and the Italians thought I was Puerto Rican and I would get chased down the block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And because of that, I wasn’t allowed off my front stoop.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her harrowing, and hilarious, childhood experiences are now the subject of her one-woman show, “&lt;a href="https://pacnyc.org/whats-on/tipi-tales-from-the-stoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tipi Tales from the Stoop&lt;/a&gt;,” running at the Perelman Performing Arts Center in FiDi from Jan. 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant recalls her family’s monikers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If they liked you, they called you ‘Indian,’ ‘Mr. Indian,’ ‘Mrs. Indian.’ If they didn’t like you, you were called ‘Wahoo’ or ‘Chief,’ she told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant, from the Kuna and Rappahannock tribe of Virginia, was born and raised in Red Hook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My family migrated to New York City in the 1800s, when Brooklyn was considered the country,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“You’d go down one block to one candy store, and the Puerto Ricans thought you were an Italian and you’d get chased down the block,” she recalled. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erica Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her mother still lives in her childhood home, which was purchased by her great-grandparents, and legend has it neighbors were against them moving into the borough. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the tipi tale, as I say in the play, is that there was a petition going around that we wouldn’t buy it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant, the artistic director of &lt;a href="https://safeharborsnyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Safe Harbors NYC&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative that promotes indigenous performing arts, recalls that Red Hook was “Mafia-run” at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These were very nice guys in nice suits who bought tickets to our raffles, who gave money at our weddings and funerals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tarrant, who also served as chairwoman for the indigenous women’s caucus at the UN, hopes her play sheds light on the Native American experience in the Big Apple — which tends to be left out of history books.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Justin Barbin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the mob in town, there was no crime, and things like parking tickets went away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think one time in my whole life, my friend Johnny, who owned a pizza parlor on the corner, got his bike stolen. It was just like the biggest crime ever,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And if someone got a ticket in front of a fire hydrant, someone would come and say to the cop, ‘Hey, we don’t do that here,’ and they’d take the ticket and rip it up. For years I used to park in front of the hydrant. One time, I got a ticket, and I was so upset and was like, ‘What has happened to this neighborhood?'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant, who lives in New Jersey now, began planning her show prior to the pandemic with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/cbsmornings/p/CBRJVMOgOBa/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;her husband, Kevin&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the NYC nonprofit the &lt;a href="https://aich.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Indian Community House&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, he died from COVID in 2020 at 51. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she used the theme of rage — from her experiences growing up and the death of her spouse — to craft the production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My first director was my husband. So as a widow, what do you do with that rage? And for me, it was taking all of that and putting it into my work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“My family migrated to New York City in the 1800s, when Brooklyn was considered the country,” said Tarrant, the artistic director of Safe Harbors NYC, an initiative that promotes indigenous performing arts. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Justin Barbin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarrant, who also served as chairwoman for the indigenous women’s caucus at the UN, hopes her play sheds light on the Native American experience in the Big Apple — which tends to be left out of history books. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have the immigrant experience, the Black experience. But we never talk about the Native experience. We only talk about it way in the past,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And I would like everyone to understand that there is a living, breathing, thriving native community here in New York City that has never left. And we’ve always been here and we have survived. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You know, when New York was New York, before everyone in Ohio ruined it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grieving pet owner sank his teeth into a Bronx dog boarding facility and its owners with a $3 million lawsuit after his beloved pooch allegedly died from wolfing down a chunk of carpet on their watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, Bronxite Kevin Gaines boarded his three Labrador retrievers, including 6-year-old Kona, at Bronx Barx in Mott Haven before jetting off for a four-day Florida trip to celebrate his birthday, according to Bronx Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=LqdSzgwzvgdkQpiYhSsc5w==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Gaines was preparing to head back to the Big Apple from Fort Lauderdale, one of Bronx Barx’s owners, Renzo Pereda, allegedly called him “crying hysterically” from an animal emergency room in Manhattan, where Kona was “unresponsive,” according to court records. A veterinarian soon informed Gaines that Kona had died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pereda allegedly told Gaines that Kona had eaten a blanket and “seemed okay” but later vomited blood and collapsed while out for a walk, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereda and co-owner Steven Toledo, however, allegedly “covered up” their carelessness to the vets by hiding the fact Kona had eaten fabric “many hours” before he began vomiting, undermining the vet’s ability to diagnose and treat the pooch, the complaint read. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A necropsy found that Kona did not eat a blanket but instead consumed a nearly foot-long piece of carpet, which blocked his intestines, according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaines said he’s bringing his suit push Bronx Barx and other pet daycares to change how they run their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s fowl.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Queens food truck worker captured a pigeon using a plastic bag and ominously brought it back to his  cart, according to shocking viral footage of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A commuter waiting for a bus spotted the worker feeding the birds next to the MS Halal truck near the Rego Center Mall on Queens Boulevard on Dec. 29.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oriana Biersack said she saw the man look around to see if anyone was watching and then tried unsuccessfully to grab one of the birds from a flock, at which point she started filming with her phone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Queens food truck worker was caught on social media capturing pigeons by using a plastic bag and bringing it back to his cart. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Oriana Biersack filmed the man and posted it on Instagram with the caption, “Omg I can’t believe what I just saw!”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man tried again and managed to grab one, shoving it in a plastic bag and returning to the food truck, the footage shows.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Omg I can’t believe what I just saw!” Biersack wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ori.the.minion/reel/DELByeKy0Bn/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt;. “I am beyond disgusted.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She told The Post, “After that, I saw him grab water and he was rinsing his hand and swishing water in his mouth … He was sticking his fingers into his mouth and scrubbing his teeth with his fingers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was shocked at what I was seeing but I didn’t record the rest,” added Biersack, who said she reported the incident to the city Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video received over 155,000 likes and 16,000 comments on different social media pages including the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DENSvpkubiu/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Yorkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEOefCDubB7/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bukharian Community&lt;/a&gt; Instagram pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I will never eat there again and after this,” one person commented. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He just ruined it for food carts,” said another.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Residents were repulsed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s disgusting. After seeing that, I don’t trust this or any other ones,” said Jon C., a 39-year-old home health aid from Rego Park, gesturing to the different food carts lining the street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a different worker operating the MS Halal truck said the pigeon wrangler has since been fired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The boss saw the video and the same day told him he’s out,” Bangladesh-native Muhammad Mola told The Post. “He’s never coming back to our cart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the nine-year cart veteran insisted the man — who he said is from his home country and was just filling in at the cart, which sells items such as meat patties, burgers and chicken or lamb over rice — was simply trying to rescue a bird whose legs got tied up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed the bird was freed after the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our country everyone loves pigeons,” said Mola, 50. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Footage showed the man trying to grab another pigeon and shove it in a plastic bag back to his food cart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They take care of them. The law is different here and he’s new, he doesn’t know the law here.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is home to many &lt;a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/when-passion-pigeon-translates-livelihood-259195" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pigeon farms&lt;/a&gt; and several different species of the bird, according to reports. They are commonly reared for &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8419116.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;food as well as flying and racing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Health Department visited the cart Tuesday and found “no evidence of pigeons,” or any other violation. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We plan to continue monitoring the situation and will take any appropriate action,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the incident, dozens flocked to 311 to file complaints about the Queens truck, reporting unsanitary conditions, animal abuse and “food from unapproved source.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New one-star reviews on Yelp also referenced the viral video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City records did not show any health code violations for MS Halal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mola said he wouldn’t be returning with the cart to that location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Business has slowed down,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of commotion — too many problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pigeons and their droppings are associated with diseases including cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, psittacosis, salmonella and E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Permits are needed to trap &lt;a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/animals-fish-plants/nuisance-wildlife-species/remove-take-legally#:~:text=recreational%20sporting%20license.-,Relocating%20an%20Animal,handled%20by%20a%20licensed%20professional." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wild animals in New York&lt;/a&gt;, and only licensed exterminators can request permits to trap pigeons, &lt;a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01601" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to 311.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, pigeon pirates have been nabbed for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/29/nyc-pigeon-pirates-ruffling-feathers-by-netting-birds/"&gt;netting the birds to sell as live targets&lt;/a&gt; in shooting contests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, a City Council bill made it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to $1,000 and up to a year in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A top city Department of Education official is soliciting donations for a non-profit that helps migrants fight deportation, raising questions about whether she is “bucking the mayor” in his bid to work with President-elect Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Vladeck, the DOE’s general counsel, posted a &lt;a href="https://x.com/LVladeck/status/1874166914471387638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dec. 31 request on X&lt;/a&gt; urging donations to the non-profit Florence Immigration &amp;amp; Refugee Rights Project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your support is essential in furthering our mission to provide free legal and social services to detained adults and unaccompanied children facing immigration removal proceedings,” Vladeck wrote. “Make a gift to the Florence Project today!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming on the heels of Mayor Adams’ “cordial” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/us-news/adams-wants-to-reopen-rikers-island-ice-office-trumps-incoming-border-czar-tom-homan-says-after-mayor-pulls-complete-180-in-sitdown/"&gt;meeting with incoming border czar&lt;/a&gt; Tom Homan and Hizzoner’s tougher stance on deporting migrants accused of violent crime, Vladeck’s pitch has raised some eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have a senior member of the administration, the top attorney for the city’s largest agency, who is basically bucking the mayor behind his back,” a source familiar with the DOE told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;After a series of crimes allegedly involving migrants, Adams in February &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/27/us-news/adams-calls-nyc-to-cooperate-with-ice-over-migrants-accused-of-serious-crimes/"&gt;called for a change &lt;/a&gt;in the city’s sanctuary policy that sharply limits communication with federal agents, and for more cooperation with US Immigration and Customs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After migrants injured cops making a shoplifting arrest, Adams last month said he’s open to deporting those accused of violent crimes instead of waiting for convictions to ship them off. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tom Homan, the incoming “border czar” appointed by President-elect Trump, met with Mayor Adams to discuss migrant deportations.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most recently, he urged the NYPD to work with Homeland Security to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/eric-adams-pushes-feds-to-charge-migrant-who-torched-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-which-could-mean-harsher-sentence/"&gt;file federal charges&lt;/a&gt; against the Guatemalan migrant accused of torching a woman to death on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am not going to be ‘warring’ with this president. I’m going to be working with this president,” said Adams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Florence Project, which raised $32.6 million in 2022, according to it’s latest available tax filings, has assisted thousands of migrants coming through the Arizona border with Mexico, and &lt;a href="https://firrp.org/resources/prose/parentalrights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;informs asylum seekers &lt;/a&gt;about their legal rights if apprehended by ICE.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Adams has toughened his stance on deporting migrants accused of violent crimes and called for greater cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Adams wants federal charges filed against the Guatemalan migrant accused of setting fire to a woman on the subway, killing her.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOE’s “Project Open Arms” is aimed at supporting migrant children. In light of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/trumps-border-czar-vows-family-facilities-built-for-mass-deportations-will-not-be-inhumane/"&gt;Trump’s threat of mass deportations,&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos recently reminded principals not to let ICE or FBI agents enter schools, but to immediately contact the legal division for instructions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Non-local law enforcement agents will be barred without a court-issued warrant or subpoena, &lt;a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/in-our-schools/policies/immigration-guidance-for-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the DOE policy says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David Bloomfield, an education professor at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Grad Center, sees no conflict in Vladeck’s pitch for the Florence Project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Florence Project supports migrants crossing the Mexican border in Arizona and their legal rights as asylum seekers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;firrp.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her call to support the organization is consistent with DOE policies to uphold immigrant student rights, and to hold immigration authorities to their legal obligations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOE insists that Vladeck followed social media protocol for city and DOE employees, saying she posted the plea for donations on New Year’s Eve when schools were closed and “on her own time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vladeck did not answer questions. An auto-reply to her DOE email address said, “I am currently working on a part-time basis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City Hall had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A money-hungry robbery crew has hit 49 storefronts across the Big Apple, taking off with ATMs and netting tens of thousands of dollars — as part of a three-month spree that spanned four boroughs, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trio of perps boosted cars to use as getaway vehicles before each of the heists in upper Manhattan, The Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens between Sept. 19 and Dec. 26, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside the stores, they looted ATMs and other goods before bolting in various vehicles, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two robberies in September, cops said the group got away with nearly $40,000 in cash from ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But police were unable to provide a total amount for all of the ATMs stolen.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 23, surveillance cameras captured two of the perps around 1:20 a.m. removing wires from an ATM inside a grocery store at 75-10 31st Ave. in Jackson Heights, Queens, according to video released by the NYPD Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops are asking the public for any information about the three suspects involved in the citywide robbery pattern. Police have yet to make any arrests. Anyone with information regarding these incidents is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or, for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

&lt;p&gt;The parents of a New Jersey man killed in a 2017 ISIS-inspired &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/31/8-killed-truck-pedestrians-downtown-nyc-terror-attack/"&gt;rental-truck terror attack in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; says a law honoring their son must be updated to prevent terrorists from using Turo and similar ride-sharing apps as they did this week in New Orleans and Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Homeland Security was required to create a report outlining strategies to help prevent vehicular terrorist attacks as part of the “Darren Drake Act,” named after a 32-year-old among the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/31/de-blasio-forgets-to-honor-terror-attack-victims-at-their-memorial/"&gt;eight stuck and killed by a rented Home Depot truck&lt;/a&gt; driven onto a bike path by terrorist Sayfullo Saipov in the Halloween attack along the West Side Highway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://gottheimer.house.gov/posts/release-gottheimers-bipartisan-darren-drake-act-to-be-signed-into-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; law sponsored by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) &lt;/a&gt;required DHS to draft a list of “best practices” for car and truck rental companies to report suspicious behavior by renters to law enforcement to help prevent vehicles from being used as weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Darren Drake died in an ISIS-related terror attack in 2017, inspiring Drake’s law.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the law fails to directly address &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/what-is-turo-rental-app-used-by-both-new-orleans-terrorist-and-trump-vegas-cybertruck-bomber/"&gt;car-sharing apps like Turo&lt;/a&gt;, which act as AirBnb-like middlemen by allowing users to rent vehicles from hosts registered with the site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turo is under scrutiny because the two vehicles used in the deadly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/horrific-video-shows-moment-suspected-terrorist-shamsud-din-jabbar-rammed-past-bourbon-street-barricade/"&gt;New Year’s Day terror attacks&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas and New Orleans were rented on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Jimmy and Barbara Drake praised Gottheimer for sponsoring the bill, but told The Post DHS must crack down on companies like Turo – and they called for amended or new legislation requiring it.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“It’s obvious that this bill might need a little updating,” said Jimmy Drake. “Up until these incidents in Vegas and New Orleans, we all had great aspirations for the bill preventing [terrorists] from killing people with a car.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The law should cover all aspects because  [terrorists] get around all corners, so it shouldn’t just be the rental agencies – but all aspects,” said his wife. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gottheimer told The Post he’s reached out to DHS to “ensure they immediately brief Turo and all rental car companies on actions they must take to stop terror trucks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed near Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan on October 31, 2017.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without offering specifics, the pol said he’s working on new legislation “that goes even further to provide more tools to prevent these heinous terrorist attacks” and “stop lone wolf terrorists from using terror trucks as weapons of destruction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His office would not turn over a copy of the DHS report, saying it is marked “For Official Use Only.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darren Drake was a project manager for Moody’s Investors Service at the World Trade Center. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jimmy Drake, Darren’s father, is calling for revisions to the law following the attack in New Orleans.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New Milford, N.J. resident had recently lost 93 pounds after undergoing lap band surgery and was out for a bike ride between meetings when the truck hit and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Turo spokesperson said the company doesn’t “believe that either renter” in the New Year’s Day attacks “had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DHS didn’t return messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Investigation would be overhauled and given new powers – including the authority to prosecute corrupt government employees — if a&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/24/us-news/prominent-nyc-attorney-joins-the-race-for-big-apple-mayor/"&gt; prominent white-collar lawyer running for mayor wins the race.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency would be rebranded the “Citywide Department of Public Integrity” and rely on a team of “elite anti-corruption prosecutors” who’d fast track cases through a newly created NYC Corruption Court under mayoral candidate Jim Walden’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This reimagines DOI and turn it into something more like the [U.S.] Department of Justice,” Walden told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under current law, the DOI can only prosecute misdemeanors, so Walden said he’d push for legislation also allowing it to handle felonies and provide whistleblowers amnesty in exchange for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The office would be independent like DOI, but its commissioner would serve a 10-year term rather than at the pleasure of the sitting mayor and City Council.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walden, a former federal prosecutor who also has long history of representing elected officials and other clients in cases involving Big Apple politics, is currently handling a lawsuit indirectly tied to federal bribery charges pending against Mayor Eric Adams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brooklyn Heights resident attributed his desire to create the new department to “23 years of suing agencies and seeing corruption all over the place and then living through three-and-a-half years of a federal investigation into [former Mayor] Bill de Blasio and an indictment of Mayor Adams.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walden jumped in the race two months ago and is running as an apolitical independent, trying to take a page from former Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s playbook by seeking support from both the left and right.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sons of firefighters killed on 9/11 are being promoted to FDNY lieutenant this week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday James Dowdell will attain the same rank as his father, Lt. Kevin Dowdell, who was a 21-year department veteran when he was murdered by terrorists who flew two commercial jets into the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He loved everything about the firehouse,” Dowdell said of his dad, who died at 46, “and he loved coming home to his family too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;James Dowdell will attain the same rank as his father, Lt. Kevin Dowdell, who was killed on September 11, 2001.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kevin Dowdell spent 21 years with the FDNY. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FDNY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The younger Dowdell had turned 17 on Sept. 10 and was at Xavier High School in Manhattan when the horror unfolded. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He remembers being on lockdown with no information about his dad, a member of Rescue Co. 4 in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When his mother told him and his brother Patrick, who was away at college, that she still hadn’t heard from him the next day, “it wasn’t a good sign.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’d been involved in a ton of fires and emergencies, but he always found time to say, ‘You might see this, but I’m O.K.,'” Dowdell, who works at Rescue 2 in Brooklyn, recalled. “We still held up hope for a while. Every time the door opened, we’d be looking to see if it was him … Hours turned into days, days turned into weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;His father’s remains were never recovered. Dowdell, who has two sons and a daughter and lives in  Rockaway, is being promoted on his dad’s birthday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what firehouse he will be assigned to at this point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To get his rank on his birthday, it’s special,” Dowdell said. “It just makes it like a full circle moment.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also being promoted to lieutenant is Firefighter John Bergin, whose father John was firefighter with Rescue 5 when he was killed in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Bergin, who was 9 at the time, works at Ladder 157 in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;John Bergin, whose father also died at the attacks, will also be promoted to lieutenant.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bergin was nine years old at the time of his father John’s death.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FDNY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I remember the day we were told he wasn’t coming home,” said Bergin, who had two sisters who were 6 and 12 at the time. His mom said, “‘Daddy went to work and he’s not coming home.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the 32-year-old who is with Ladder 157 and lives in Staten Island never lost his desire to follow in his father’s footsteps, he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to be a fireman for as long as I can remember,”  Bergin said. “From day one, that’s what I wanted to do — be a fireman.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops working extra shifts in the subway in the wake of several shocking crimes — including a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;woman fatally torched on a train&lt;/a&gt; — are having their hours cut, but the NYPD is promising replacements, sources told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new rules that went into effect on Jan. 1 slashed the number of subway overtime hours cops can work in half, police sources said. Detectives are now being limited to 40 hours a month total OT and “no more than two transit details,” one longtime cop told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officers were previously allowed to do four or six of the 7.5-hour underground shifts per month, the cop said.  &lt;/p&gt;

8029px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crime in the subway has been down overall so far this yet, but the system has been plagued by a surge in violent crimes recently. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new rules come after The Post revealed shocking allegations that ex-top uniformed cop Jeffrey Maddrey was granting overtime to an underling for sexual favors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lt. Quathisha Epps, the NYPD’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;top earner who made $403,515&lt;/a&gt;, including $204,453 in OT, filed an explosive Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint making the claims, The Post revealed in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/he-was-a-predator-nypd-lieutenant-recalls-horrifying-sex-demands-of-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;front-page exclusive&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The Post also revealed that First Grade Detective Ingrid Sanders, Maddrey’s driver, was the seventh-highest overtime earner in the department, raking in an eye-popping $163,414 in OT last year, boosting her total salary last fiscal year to $352,462, records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also working for Maddrey, Ada Reyes made $42,500 as a new police officer in 2019 but her pay jumped to $154,405 in 2024, including $55,923 in overtime, city records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through his lawyer, Maddrey has insisted the sex with Epps was “consensual” and denied that he was providing overtime for sex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police source said the department was punishing the wrong people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a knee-jerk reaction that’s not well thought out because obviously random violent crime is surging,” the source said. “You’re punishing cops and detectives when the abusers were at the top.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the NYPD said Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch was reviewing overtime management policies and procedures, “to ensure all overtime is administered appropriately and to maintain honor and integrity throughout the NYPD.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, there will be no reduction in the number of police personnel patrolling the New York City transit system as more officers will be deployed on straight time to ensure subway safety,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crime in the subway has been down overall so far this yet, but the system has been plagued by a surge in violent crimes recently, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debrina Kawam, 57, from Toms River, N.J., was set on fire on a subway car around 7:30 a.m. Dec. 22 as she slept on an idle F train at the Still Avenue station in Brooklyn. Guatemalan migrant &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/nypd-searching-man-fatally-set-woman-fire-subway-rcna185160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil&lt;/a&gt;, 33, was charged with murder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/lunatic-accused-of-shoving-commuter-into-path-of-nyc-subway-charged-with-attempted-murder/"&gt;Kamel Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, 23, was charged with second-degree assault after he allegedly shoved a complete stranger onto the tracks for no reason at the 18th Street No. 1 train station shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 31, cops said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assaults in the system jumped in December, from 35 to 49 for a 40% as of last Sunday over the same period last year, NYPD data show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft  poured millions of dollars into efforts to legalize congestion tolling — and they stand to be among the biggest winners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uber spent $2 million alone from 2015 to 2019 to promote congestion pricing, roughly $1 million of which went to some of the city’s top lobbyists, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/03/uber-spent-2m-to-help-push-through-congestion-pricing/"&gt;company confirmed to The Post in 2019.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, both and Uber and Lyft have continued to hire top lobbyists to help persuade key state and city officials to approve the controversial levy, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft has given $18,500 the past four years to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s campaign. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrew Schwartz / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how much the companies spent lobbying for congestion pricing because the lobbyists hired worked on multiple issues, and officials records don’t break it down.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride-share companies declined to provide The Post a breakdown — or even an estimate — of its lobbying expenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lyft — which also own the CitiBike program — has also directly contributed to pols who have been pushing the polarizing scheme. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Lyft poured over $125,000 into state campaigns since 2020 – including $18,500 the past four years to Hochul, who pushed it forward after a brief pause near the election, records show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also donated $10,000 in 2020 to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who backed congestion pricing when he was in office but &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/11/opinion/andrew-cuomo-yes-i-approved-congestion-pricing-but-its-time-to-hit-the-brakes/"&gt;now wants to hit the brakes &lt;/a&gt;on it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been money well spent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The growing industry — which got a huge boost last year when the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/19/nyc-lifts-cap-on-for-hire-cars-provided-theyre-electric/"&gt;city lifted a cap on how many for-hire vehicles can be on the road &lt;/a&gt;— stands to make a killing because the new surcharge is both cheaper than the $9 fee private vehicles will pay to enter parts of Manhattan, and the $2.90 straphangers pay to take subways and buses, critics say. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft has spent $125,000 on state campaigns of those who will enforce congestion pricing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ride-hailing services will be slapped with an additional $1.50 surcharge for Manhattan trips below 60th Street. But the additional costs will be passed on to customers — just like a similar $2.75 “congestion fee” on all trips below 96&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street authorized in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is corporate greed at its worst,” said Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens), who opposes congestion tolling. “These companies will stop at nothing to rewrite the rules in their favor while leaving chaos in their wake.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new tolls fit “right into” Uber and Lyft’s “business model to charge a premium for access to the scarcest street — those in core Manhattan” – and its customers will benefit from faster service with less cars on the street, said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City lifted the cap for how many for-hire vehicles can be on the road, giving Uber and Lyft a major boost.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sudden sticker shock here won’t be felt by Uber and Lyft or their passengers, but by the regular driver,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Susan Lee, one of the plaintiffs in a slew of lawsuits seeking to stop the congestion tolling, blamed the for-hire industry for “pushing” congestion tolling and flooding city streets with its roughly 100,000 vehicles — causing much of NYC’s gridlock. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the motivation is to incentivize people to take mass transit, then the new fee for for-hire vehicles should be equivalent to” the $2.90 cost for a bus or subway ride,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft also owns CitiBike.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Josh Gold, a Uber spokesman, said the company was “early supporters of congestion pricing — and still is — but “government can’t continue to raise prices and fees on New Yorkers and expect no &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/increased-regulation-is-threatening-good-jobs-in-nyc-319b96d6479f__;!!F0Stn7g!HiYYPlONxLDBJAKgGf36AEl037hAwJyXdVEJeBhwAB21TPBccfUjBizAD0VoQ9zZH1nx9aPUtw$" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lyft spokesman CJ Macklin said “we are supportive of congestion pricing and the positive impacts it could have on our city, but it must be done in an equitable way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our industry has already been paying a congestion fee since 2019 that has generated more than $1 billion in revenue to the MTA,” he said. “We don’t think riders should be double taxed, and we lobbied hard for them to be exempt from this new additional $1.50 congestion fee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYPD detectives are searching for a hooded man who was filmed spray-painting the words “Kill the Homeless” inside a Manhattan subway car — a week after a crazed migrant &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/"&gt;torched a homeless woman to death&lt;/a&gt; while she slept on an F train in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident, which also unfolded on the F train, was &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DELqDwYR1HU/?igsh=MWxjMW9pNnp5ZWN2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shared to Instagram&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 29, although it is unclear what day the footage was captured. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman who shot the video claimed the unidentified man — who was dressed entirely in black with a hoodie and sunglasses — sat down and scrawled the offensive phrase in black across one of the train’s light blue seats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The man said nothing as he vandalized the train. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instargram @ny_scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The man walked off the train calmly. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instargram @ny_scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The man started writing “Kill the Homeless” as the train was pulling into the station at West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man nonchalantly scribbled each letter as the woman filming remarked in astonishment, “Kill the homeless … You see him?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police are searching for a hooded vandal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instargram @ny_scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The man underestimated how much room he had for his hateful message. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instargram @ny_scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finishing the phrase in haste, he then calmly exits the stopped train without acknowledging or looking at the woman filming him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident comes amid &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt;a spate of underground attacks&lt;/a&gt;, including the New Year’s Eve shoving of an unsuspecting straphanger &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/lunatic-accused-of-shoving-commuter-into-path-of-nyc-subway-charged-with-attempted-murder/"&gt;onto the tracks&lt;/a&gt;, in front of an arriving train.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the video’s commenters suggested the man be charged with a hate crime, but conceded at most, he’d receive a fine. Others said he will likely never face justice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The message comes less than a week after Debrina Kawam, 57, was murdered on an F train.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If they found &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/ny-post-documentary-gives-inside-look-at-luigi-mangione-case/"&gt;Luigi [Mangione&lt;/a&gt;], they can find him,” wrote one commenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A knife-wielding maniac with a history of mental illness and 53 prior arrests is wanted in connection with at least two stabbings in the subway this week, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops searching for Jamar Banks were warned to use  “extreme caution” when encountering him because he is believed to be armed with “a large knife,” according to a message sent to police officers and obtained by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks, 52, is known to frequent the No. 2 and No. 5 subway lines, authorities said in the message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surveillance photo allegedly shows Banks holding the knife in gloved hands. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“He has a very very lengthy arrest history,” a police source said. “It looks like he rides the rails back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks is wanted for allegedly approaching a 31-year-old man from behind on a 2 train at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday and starting an argument, before stabbing him in the back and running away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s also suspected of knifing an off-duty MTA cleaner in the back and armpit around 6 a.m. Thursday, after starting an argument with the victim on a northbound 5 train platform at the Pelham Bay station in the Bronx, police said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker fled after the stabbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan authorities have refused to take a fresh look at the suspicious 1965 death of famed journalist and TV celebrity Dorothy Kilgallen — but Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain will star in a movie portraying the reporter’s ill-fated investigation of the JFK assassination as a “murder mystery,” The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detectives with the NYPD and Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have brushed off a plea by City Councilman Robert Holden to dig into whether Kilgallen’s death was a homicide — not “accidental,” as authorities quickly labeled it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kilgallen, a famed columnist for the New York Journal-American, was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/12/04/dorothy-kilgallens-tell-all-on-a-mafia-don-might-have-got-her-killed/"&gt;hot on the trail &lt;/a&gt;of a Mafia kingpin she suspected had planned the 1963 shooting of President John F. Kennedy when she was found dead in her Manhattan apartment. The cause was quickly deemed a drug and alcohol overdose, aborting a probe of possible foul play. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dorothy Kilgallen, a columnist and investigative reporter for the New York Journal-American, was found dead in 1965 at age 52 while investigating the JFK assassination.
 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, Holden, (D-Queens), formally asked the NYPD and the DA’s cold-case unit to reopen the Kilgallen case, but got only “lip service,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was told there was going to be an investigation, but it turned out there wasn’t,” he said.” They just looked at it on a superficial level and decided it wasn’t worth doing.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A police spokesman confirmed, “The NYPD, along with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, declined to reopen the investigation.” The decision was not explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holden said DA cold-case officials gave him a reason: “Even if we do find foul play, who do we prosecute?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But New York may have egg on its face when Hollywood looks for answers and does justice to Kilgallen’s courageous pursuit of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025, Barry Levinson will direct “Assassination,” starring Chastain as the intrepid reporter, along with fellow A-listers Al Pacino, Bryan Cranston, and Brendan Fraser, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/jared-leto-assassination-1236201212/"&gt;Deadline reports.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s cold-case unit declined to investigate the death of Dorothy Kilgallen nearly 60 years ago.&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Kilgallen’s journey will put her up against the CIA, Mafia bosses and the FBI – all who would love nothing more than to make her disappear,” the promo says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 8, 1965, the morning after she appeared as a regular panelist on the TV game show, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042168/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“What’s My Line?&lt;/a&gt;,” Kilgallen, 52, was found dead in her Manhattan townhouse. She was perched upright in a bed, naked beneath a blue bathrobe, and wearing the same makeup and floral hair accessory from the night before on TV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her husband Richard Kollmar told police she had arrived home about 11:30 pm “feeling chipper.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city’s Medical Examiner quickly ruled Kilgallen’s death accidental, a toxic mix of booze and barbiturates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hollywood star Jessica Chastain will portray Dorothy Kilgallen in the upcoming movie “Assassination.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;River / MEGA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Shaw, the ME’s ruling was wrong and unfairly smeared Kilgallen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the mystery, Kilgallen’s dossier of research on the JFK killing — possibly seized by law-enforcement agents when she died — vanished without a trace. The files remain missing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her death left a cloud of suspicion and unanswered questions that have persisted for nearly six decades,” said Holden, who pushed for the probe after reading two books by author Mark Shaw, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/12/04/dorothy-kilgallens-tell-all-on-a-mafia-don-might-have-got-her-killed/"&gt;“The Reporter who Knew Too Much,” &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/18/new-book-says-manhattan-da-dumped-probe-of-columnists-jfk-linked-death/"&gt;“Denial of Justice.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kilgallen was compiling a stack of evidence. Among other major crimes, she covered the 1964 trial of Jack Ruby, the bar owner who shot and killed accused JFK assassin Lee Harvey ­Oswald at Dallas police headquarters. She was the only reporter to interview Ruby, who called himself “a patsy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kilgallen published Ruby’s testimony to the Warren Commission in closed-door hearings before its official release, vowing “I’d rather die than reveal the source.”  The FBI had her under surveillance, according to records Shaw obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“The Reporter Who Knew Too Much” by Mark Shaw delved into Kilgallen’s career and untimely death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kilgallen’s 18-month investigation led her to suspect that New Orleans Mafia don Carlos Marcello masterminded the JFK and Oswald killings, Shaw wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to break the real story and have the biggest scoop of the century,” the journalist is quoted as telling her lawyer. But she confided to friends she feared for her safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Shaw’s urging, Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/01/29/manhattan-das-office-probing-death-of-reporter-with-possible-jfk-ties/"&gt;briefly opened a cold case&lt;/a&gt; on Kilgallen in 2017, but &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/02/da-no-evidence-reporter-investigating-jfk-assassination-was-murdered/"&gt;dropped it &lt;/a&gt;eight months later, citing “no evidence” she was murdered. However, his office failed to interview still-living witnesses, sources said. DA officials refused to discuss any findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a major motion picture, “Assassination” can shine a long-overdue national spotlight on Kilgallen’s life – and death, Holden said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dorothy Kilgallen’s story should be told,” the councilman said. “Hopefully this movie is the catalyst to bring it to the public’s attention and put pressure on investigative bodies to get to the bottom of it.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original subway vigilante, Bernie Goetz, thinks the prosecution of Daniel Penny for the chokehold death of Jordan Neely aboard a train was “BS.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goetz, 77, spoke to WABC’s Frank Morano Dec. 10 about the Penny case, nearly 40 years to the day after he shot a foursome of thugs who tried to rob him on a Manhattan train.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is about New York, and New York I consider a BS society, and what the Penny case has in common with my case is, it’s all BS,” he told the host of the show, “The Other Side of Midnight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is what you have in some democratic states with left wing government,” added Goetz. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goetz said the legal system should be “a truth-seeking process,” but that his case, and&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/06/infamous-vigilante-bernie-goetz-daniel-penny-has-to-pay-for-killing-jordan-neely/"&gt; the case against Penny,&lt;/a&gt; were not. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Here when you see lawfare, it’s not so much to protect the public but to simply impose the will of the people running the system,” Goetz added in the 30-minute interview. “That’s what my case was and that’s what you have here. It was a political trial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He called Penny’s acquittal “a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Penny &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/daniel-penny-cleared-of-all-charges-in-jordan-neelys-death/"&gt;was acquitted Dec. 9 &lt;/a&gt;by a Manhattan jury on charges of criminally negligent homicide in the high profile case which sparked intense debate about mental illness, public safety and the responsibilities of bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 26-year-old Marine veteran was caught on camera putting Neely, 30, in a chokehold after the troubled homeless man&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/witness-to-deadly-subway-chokehold-tells-cops-jordan-neely-scared-living-daylights-out-of-everybody-trial-video/"&gt; menaced others and made threats&lt;/a&gt; on May 1, 2023 while on an uptown F train.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 22, 1984, Goetz opened fire on four youths who demanded money from him on a downtown 2 train. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the victims, James Ramseur,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2011/12/23/one-of-bernhard-goetzs-victims-kills-self-on-anniversary-of-subway-shoot-2/"&gt; committed suicide&lt;/a&gt; by intentionally overdosing on prescription pills on the 27th anniversary of the shooting in 2011; another victim, Darell Cabey, was left paralyzed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goetz said the chaos of today’s subways doesn’t compare to riding the rails in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was much more violence in the 80s,” he said. “It was a poorer society. We had a much greater percentage of the population preying on the rest of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His own case “basically shed light on the high crime in New York and that New York City was failing as a city, and also the government here was simply not addressing crime at the time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goetz said his prosecution was sparked by then-governor Mario Cuomo’s presidential aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mario Cuomo himself was saying New York had successful policies to raise people up from poverty, and in fact New York was failing and I went around saying on national TV that New York government was incompetent and corrupt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Penny’s prosecution would likely change his life, Goetz mused. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This may change his life a lot. You don’t really appreciate how much BS goes on until you’re on the inside on some type of high publicity situation,” Goetz said. “He’s gone through this, he may have some good insights as he grows older.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/bonus-content/superlative-states#book-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;home to an eye-popping 436 Guinness World Record holders&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 8% of all the risk-takers in the country and second only to California’s 615, according to the 70th edition of the “&lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/guinness-world-records-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Guinness World Records.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are four of the New Yorkers whose grit and determination helped them reach immortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miki Sudo – Most wins of the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest (female), (10);&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Most hot dogs eaten at the contest (female), (51); Most hot dogs eaten in one minute, (6); Fastest time to eat a burrito, (31.47) seconds; Most jello eaten with a fork in 30 seconds, (1.30 kilograms&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In July, Miki Sudo set the Guinness World Record for most hot dogs eaten at a Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest by a female and most wins of the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest by a female. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Upper East Side native entered her first Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2014 and has taken home first place every year since — excluding the one summer she took off while she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, she set the world records for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/04/us-news/miki-sudo-sets-new-record-at-nathans-famous-hotdog-eating-contest/"&gt;most hot dogs eaten at a Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest by a female&lt;/a&gt; at 51 and a half, and most wins of the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest by a female, 10. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For her gut-busting feat, Sudo, 39, received a certificate from Guinness, and bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, the most fun after Nathan’s is just watching the footage back,” she told The Post. “Because it’s hard to live that in the moment when you’re up there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;span class="embed-youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Video" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1lvjSRNpwM?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is ranked as the No. 1 female competitive eater with Major League Eating, with feats like devouring 16.5 pints of ice cream in six minutes, 170 wings in 12 minutes, and 96 tacos in 10 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudo, who grew up in Tokyo, “fell into” competitive eating in 2011 as a college student, when she downed a 12-pound bowl of pho — full of a gallon of broth, two pounds of noodles and two pounds of meat — at a Las Vegas restaurant’s contest.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is studying to become a dental hygienist. She is married to Nick Wehry, the No. 6 male competitive eater with Major League Eating.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inga Simning- Most knuckle pushups in one minute (female), (76)&lt;strong&gt;;&lt;/strong&gt; most number of pull-ups completed in one minute (female), (39)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;most pull-ups with a 20-pound pack (female), (21)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Inga Simning, a mom of two from Pittsford, NY, has three world records. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first record the mom of two from Pittsford, NY set, for most pull-ups in a minute, came about through social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just saw it pop up on my Facebook feed, the prior record. I think she had done 36 pull ups and at the time, I could do 22,” said Simning, 38.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The speech pathologist, who grew up in Omaha, NE, was determined to break it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘It’s a minute record, so I’m going to do a minute a day and see where it gets me.’ Within a couple of months I was doing 30.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After she completed the pull-up world record, in June 2022, she came across the knuckle pushup world record, which was 70 in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I never actually did pushups before, but to see where I was at, I tried and I was at 60.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simning is already gearing up to set her next record — for fastest marathon in a four person costume. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably going to be a caterpillar. That is what people have done in the past because it gives you a little bit more flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin Head – Most lunges in one hour (male), (2,825); farthest distance traveled by lunge in one hour (2.14 miles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Head, who lives in Dumbo, set both his world records in 2024.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Brooklyn fitness trainer who works for Life Time health clubs, said the idea to set that particular record was a no-brainer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was teaching over 30 classes a week, and I do so many lunges teaching,” said Head, 31, a native of Kilgore, TX.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While he was researching lunging world records, he found a record category on Guinness’ website that no one had ever broken — farthest distance traveled by lunge in one hour, which the record book set at a minimum of 1.99 miles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Out of both of my world records, that, by far, was the hardest. My first training session was horrible. I could barely do a mile of lunging in an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

Check out the full story by clicking the link in our bio. Austin, 30, took on the mammoth challenge to raise money for the Life Time Foundation, which was established to inspire healthier people, a healthier way of life and a healthier planet.  &lt;a title="lunges" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lunges?refer=embed"&gt;#lunges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fitness" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fitness?refer=embed"&gt;#fitness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="guinnessworldrecords" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/guinnessworldrecords?refer=embed"&gt;#guinnessworldrecords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Guinness World Records - Guinness World Records" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-Guinness-World-Records-7351483381227604768?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound – Guinness World Records – Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, while he was training for that record, he managed to break another record &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;for most lunges in one hour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My final tally was almost 500 over the current world record,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twelve days later, he set out to break the record he originally had in mind, for farthest distance traveled by lunge in one hour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 70 people, including his mom and grandmother, came out to witness the feat, which he started at Jane’s Carousel in Dumbo, where he lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Jones – Heaviest jack-o’-lantern, (2,749 pounds&lt;/strong&gt;); &lt;strong&gt;and largest circumference, (21’1”&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sculptor Eric Jones of West Clarksville, NY has a passion for pumpkin carving, and it led him to earn two world records.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The West Clarksville, NY sculptor’s path to his two world records came about last year, after he reached out to Travis Gienger, the Minnesota man who grew the world’s largest pumpkin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I asked him if I could carve that and raise some money for a charity for veterans with PTSD. I carved about 180 degrees around it and I did three service members, a female, male and disabled veteran and a bald eagle,” said Jones, 49, who studied art and design at Alfred University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A 200-pound piece fell off the back side of it during transport and I used that to sculpt the service dog, and I set it on top of the pumpkin.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jones always had a passion for pumpkin carving, but it really took off after he gifted one of his creations to Al Roker on the “Today” show in 2017, which led to his appearance on the Food Network series “Halloween Wars.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When pumpkin season ends, Jones takes up snow sculpting, and in summer, sand sculpting. His commissioned pieces start at $1,500 and his star-studded clientele includes pro athletes like Jay Cutler and Charles Barkley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 9-foot tall snow sculpture he did of Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs got the most attention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was them doing their famous back slap handshake and that got around 3 million shares on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jones’ snow sculpture of Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs got around 3 million shares on Facebook. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Eric Jones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he is proud of his world records, Jones has even more pride for the nonprofit he created, &lt;a href="https://www.sculptingforsmiles.com/about-contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sculpting for Smiles&lt;/a&gt;, where he makes free sculptures for children who are ill or disabled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a young lady in a hospital in Buffalo who was struck by a car. She was paralyzed and had gone a couple of weeks without smiling. She had just gotten this German Shepherd puppy and she couldn’t enjoy it because she was in the hospital,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So I sculpted a nine-foot tall German shepherd out of snow in the parking lot of a hospital. They pushed her over to the window and showed her and it got a big smile on her face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job networking site LinkedIn employed Nazi tactics when it banned an unabashedly pro-Israel Manhattan accountant who regularly spoke out on the platform against antisemitism, he claimed in a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marc J. Strohl, who had about 14,000 LinkedIn followers between his personal account and his business profile for ProTax Consulting Services, is a self-described “proud Jew” who lost relatives in the Holocaust as well as the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/world-news/israel-kills-hamas-commander-who-led-one-of-most-heinous-oct-7-attacks-on-kibbutzim/"&gt;Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terror attack &lt;/a&gt;that left 1,200 Israelis dead, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strohl, 59, claimed he regularly reported or commented on antisemitic LinkedIn posts, including messages “that appeared to praise” the terror group and the massacre, as well as “posts on LinkedIn that praised Adolf Hitler and Nazis,” he said in the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;

Strohl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He alerted the platform to multiple offensive remarks, according to screenshots provided to The Post, including, “Death to Israel,” and a post that described Jews as “cruel and emotionless animals that need to be extinct.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the reports I filed against people [whose comments] … were abusive to the point of hate speech,” Strohl said. “They didn’t take any action, to the best of my knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His account was mysteriously suspended twice in 2024 until he was banned without explanation in October, Strohl alleged in his Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit against LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The Nazis engaged in similar such behavior in Germany in the 1930s of excluding Jews from public places and from businesses,” he contended in the claim. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strohl claimed he was “aware of a lot of Jews and Zionists” who have been banned from LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem “is absolutely huge,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed the company outsources its content moderation responsibilities “to countries known to harbor a lot of antisemitic sentiment including but not limited to Pakistan and South Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certified public accountant was “held to completely different and harsher standards than Muslim, Arab . . .  and ‘pro-Palestine’ accounts,” he alleged in the complaint, which seeks unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alleged pro-Hamas sentiment from LinkedIn users was so pronounced in the weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, one pro-Israel supporter &lt;a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/10/19/do-you-support-terrorism-you-might-be-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;created a website listing&lt;/a&gt; the terrorist-loving commenters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“LinkedIn, through its algorithms and ‘Trust &amp;amp; Safety Team’ has refused to take down posts supporting Hamas, criticizing Israel, praising Hitler and Nazis . . . and has responded to complaints made that those posts are not in violation of LinkedIn’s terms and conditions,” Strohl said in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City is a hellhole of unchecked crime, rampant homelessness, empty office buildings, and raging maniacs on every corner and subway platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How, then, can it be that the Big Apple drew 64.3 million visitors (tourists and business travelers) in 2024, a mere hair below the 2019 record of 66.2 million and 3.5% more than in 2023, according to the New York City Tourism + Conventions organization?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can total visitors in 2025 be projected to top that 2019 record, with at least 67 million visitors expected this year?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York’s tourism sector was nearly decimated during COVID-19 — but nearly 65 million tourists arrived last year, with even more expected in 2025.   &lt;span class="credit"&gt;peresanz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do the tourists harbor a death wish? Or are they just ordinary masochists who get their jollies from being held up at gunpoint and cursed at by psychos?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are business travelers wasting their time coming here, when a supposed glut of abandoned office buildings is an article of faith among “experts” who maintain they’ll never recover from the COVID-10 exodus?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, in fact, Manhattan’s office towers are anything but empty — the best ones, at least,  are so full, that tenants complain they can find no available space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter"&gt;

					&lt;/h2&gt;
		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while some local pols and pundits have given up on the Big Apple, the rest of the world clearly hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have a clearer perception than do our home-grown “experts”  hung up on every grim statistic or false perception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;News reports of fatal subway pushes aren’t the only source of information for people who don’t live or work here. They also view our town through the social media prism, which is dominated by Facebook and Instagram photos of happy families and friends enjoying the sights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Even though many fret about the migrant-filled Roosevelt Hotel, the real news is that the Four Seasons in Midtown has finally reopened its doors. 
 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Seth Gottfried&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The hotel had been shuttered for years following a dispute with owner Ty Warner. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Julie Stapen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are, also,  “Saturday Night Live” opening sequences which colorfully portray Midtown Manhattan and Rockefeller Center as the center of arts, entertainment, and culture; the televised Times Square New Year’s Eve ball drops, which are far more fun than fireworks in London and Dubai; and inimitable Big Apple public spectacles from the Coney Island Mermaid Parade to the New York City Marathon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Probably most important to those considering a trip here are observations by people who came for pleasure or business and had a grand old time, irrespective of horror stories about crime-committing migrants at the Roosevelt Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning it into a central Midtown migrants center was a sad commentary on Mayor Adams’ judgment and a blight on his entire record. But to visitors, the more meaningful news is the reopening of the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street — among many recent hospitality-industry developments that proclaimed a triumphant end to COVID-era defeatism like no other place in America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Events like the annual New York City Marathon remain key tourism draws year after year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ah, but what about the subways, where a record 12 murders occurred in 2024? Shouldn’t travelers be scared out of their wits? My fellow No. 6 train riders who recently asked in fractured English for “directions to the Statue of Liberty” certainly weren’t afraid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perspective is needed there, too. If someone told you your chances of being assaulted in the system were a less-than-minute one in two million based on the number of incidents and rides taken, as current NYPD and MTA data show, you wouldn’t likely feel a need to switch to Ubers to go a few blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When The New York Times reports, as it did this week, that felony assaults in 2019 were even fewer than in 2024 — one for every 4.5 million rides — it can sound like the subways have grown incomparably more risky. But percentages can be meaningless even when they’re accurate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Despite a clutch of high-profile subway attacks, public transport remains exceedingly safe in New York, according to reports. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Deccio Serrano/NurPhoto/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This probably explains why, despite the much-reported increases in mayhem, subway ridership has not only not fallen — it’s continued rising. Total ridership in 2024 was 1.195 billion, according to the MTA, a healthy uptick from 1.15 billion in 2023. That’s still well below 1.699 billion in 2019 when no one had yet heard of “work from home,” but the upward trend is clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our alleged woes  (well, they’re real woes but not as bad as commonly portrayed) pale in comparison to those in other large cities. Visitation levels reflect the differences. Take, for example, the shooting gallery in Chicago, which is the US city most similar to New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windy City visits have also risen since 2020 but not nearly as much as in Gotham. In 2023, they were 15.6% below the 2019 level, compared with 6.6% in the Big Apple (Chicago’s total for 2024 wasn’t available at press time). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Despite offering far more robust convention and business traveler facilities, Chicago has not enjoyed a tourism renaissance like New York, according to critics.   &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even Chicago’s apparent, modest recovery is skewed by its much larger convention facilities than ours — 3.2 million square feet, twice as much as in New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we ain’t dead yet — a truth that’s plain to outsiders even if our home-grown “experts” have yet to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of candidates taking the test to join the NYPD has plunged by more than half in the past eight years, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prospective members of New York’s Finest went from 18,000 in 2017 to just 8,000 this year — a 55% decline, according to data from the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest problem is that cops are telling their friends and family&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/nypd-black-amp-blue-nyc-cops-suffered-record-breaking-number-of-injuries-in-2024/"&gt; not to bother with this job,&lt;/a&gt; even as a stepping stone, because it’s not worth it,” a Brooklyn cop with more than a dozen years on the job told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The number of candidates trying to join the NYPD has plummeted in recent years.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’ll be worked to the bone, attacked by perps and politicians and hammered with nonsense complaints and ticky-tack discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One longtime NYPD officer said his son plans to join the Suffolk County Police Department this year despite a lower starting salary rather than follow in his father’s footsteps in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’re not forced to work every New Year’s Eve and Fourth of July,” the dad said. “You don’t have to worry about getting stabbed, shot and then sued all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk County department starts cops at $43,000 annually but pay increases to $158,828 after 11 and half years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York City cops start at $53,790.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One Brooklyn cop who retired recently said he advises young people &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/report-blasts-nypd-unit-aimed-at-quality-of-life-issues-for-its-secretive-stance/"&gt;against joining the department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD members are allegedly telling friends and family not to join the force. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I tell them if you can find another agency that’s willing to take you I would go,” the 45-year-old said. “I would run for the hills if you can.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayor Adams pledged in November to bring on&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/nypd-classes-canned-over-migrant-crisis-budget-cuts-to-be-reinstated-adding-1-6k-cops-by-next-fall/"&gt; 1,600 new cops in 2025 &lt;/a&gt;— but the city has been having trouble finding viable candidates, a union spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if the city gets to 800 Academy cadets — candidates who pass the test and meet all the other mental and physical benchmarks — by its Jan. 29 target, the candidate pool will be shallow as it comes time to hire the second class of 800 in April, the union said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-module__title-wrapper"&gt;
			
			&lt;div class="inline-module__unsubmitted-title-wrapper"&gt;
				&lt;h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md"&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class="inline-module__success-title-wrapper"&gt;
				&lt;h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md"&gt;
					Thanks for signing up!				&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The general rule is that one out of every eight candidates pass the test and meet all the other criteria. So to fill 1,600 academy slots, a pool of almost 13,000 candidates is needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Faced with a shrinking pool of prospects, the NYPD has taken the unusual step of reaching out to candidates who took the test as far back as seven years ago, said a source involved in the process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/18/us-news/nypd-headcount-faces-record-lows-200-nyc-cops-leave-per-month-data/"&gt;department headcount is the lowest&lt;/a&gt; it has been in more than three decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Prospective members have declined by 55% in the past eight years.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Adams pledged to bring on 1,600 new NYPD officers in 2025.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrew Schwartz / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, cited “stupid laws” that the City Council has passed that hamstring cops. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of my students don’t want to be cops anymore,” Giacalone said. “The whole class used to want to be cops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the leftist-dominated Council passed six bills critics say kills morale and reduces police effectiveness, including the chokehold ban, which makes it illegal for police to put pressure on a person’s neck or diaphragm, and the “How Many Stops Act,” which requires police officers to fill out paperwork for every encounter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State bail reform has also made the job less attractive as cops see the same perps — some of them migrants who cops are not permitted to turn over to ICE — committing crimes and getting right back out on the street, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some blame bills passed by Council for the decline, including the chokehold ban and the “How Many Stops Act.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PBA President Patrick Hendry wants the city to find a balance between the laws and the pay to make the job more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, potential recruits know that a career in the NYPD means enduring more work, more risk, more pressure and more scrutiny, in exchange for fewer benefits and lower pay than almost any other policing job,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our city needs to balance the scales — by both reducing the burdens on cops and boosting compensation — in order to compete for the top recruits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/real-estate/bill-cosby-facing-foreclosure-on-nyc-townhouse/"&gt; the second Manhattan foreclosure in less than a month &lt;/a&gt;for the disgraced “America’s Dad,” whose reputation went up in flames after 60 women accused him of sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and Camille have defaulted on a $17.5 million loan taken against18 East 71st, &lt;a href="https://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-1911-julius-kayser-house-no-18-east.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a six-story, 12,060-square-foot home built in 1899 &lt;/a&gt;which sits just steps from Central Park in the Upper East Side Historic District. &lt;/p&gt;

Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cosby secretly bought the property through a lawyer for $6.2 million in 1987, at the height of his fame on NBC’s “The Cosby Show.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be a present for Camille, but the couple later accused Mary Waller, the lawyer who oversaw the purchase, of &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-13-ca-292-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;embezzling millions from them&lt;/a&gt;, and by 1990 put the property &lt;a href="https://observer.com/2005/09/a-cosby-mystery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the name of Camille’s mother&lt;/a&gt;, records show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple hasn’t paid anything on the loan since June, and also owes more than $300,000 in taxes on the property, according to Manhattan Supreme Court papers filed by First Foundation Bank. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The couple allegedly defaulted on a $4.2 million loan on a four-story Lenox Hill home at 243 E. 61st St. they’ve owned since 1980. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CitiMortgage sued the couple in December for the default, &lt;a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/bill-cosby-faces-foreclosure-upper-east-side-townhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Crain’s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cosby’s once sterling image was destroyed years ago as numerous women came forward to accuse the funnyman of drugging and sexually assaulting them in different incidents over the course of years in a high profile scandal that culminated in a 2018 trial in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This couple got on the subway looking to get off. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pair of horny straphangers were seen apparently getting frisky on the subway last week, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/NyShittyNews/status/1872777045165654457" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disturbing video&lt;/a&gt; of the encounter that went viral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The footage shows a hijab-wearing woman kneeling on the floor of the subway with her face buried in her beau’s lap as he is seated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A subway rider called out a couple who appeared to be engaging in a lewd act on the train.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X @NyShittyNews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, she appears to lift up his shirt and appears to kiss his stomach.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rider filmed the bizarre scene before calling the exhibitionist couple out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman is seen covering her face after, looking humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“And you got your hijab on,” the shocked straphanger exclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman’s partner tried to interject but the man filming cut him off, saying, “Allah’s so disappointed!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 37-second-long clip, which was shared on the &lt;a href="https://x.com/NyShittyNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York S–tty X and Instagram pages&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 27, amassed over 9.7 million views. “Please get a room,” the account moderators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Social media users bashed the couple for what appeared to be a bizarre display of public affection on the subway.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X @NyShittyNews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social media users were shocked by the brazen PDA, and some suspected them of nearly engaging in oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Of all the things you don’t expect to see on the train, this is one of them,” said one woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some have no decency,” said another person. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The couple looked embarrassed as the other rider called them out for their actions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X @NyShittyNews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Public transportation just got way too personal,” one person remarked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they like people to watch them do the deed,” one person wondered in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the top overtime earners in disgraced ex-NYPD Chief &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/nypd-offices-where-jeffrey-maddrey-had-sex-with-employee-searched/"&gt;Jefferey Maddrey’s office&lt;/a&gt; is talking to federal investigators as they probe sex-for-overtime allegations uncovered by The Post, law enforcement sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingrid Sanders, the ex-driver of the department former top uniformed cop, had her cell phone taken by the feds, who are looking at whether the NYPD was using federal funds to pay for the overtime, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only thing she can be talking about is her overtime and her interactions with Maddrey,” a source familiar with the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the top overtime earners in disgraced ex-NYPD Chief Jefferey Maddrey’s office is talking to federal investigators. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanders, who joined the department in 1993, made an eye-popping $163,414 in OT last year — and resigned days after The Post exposed her boss’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;alleged tawdry conduct at police headquarters&lt;/a&gt; with another underling in a front-page expose on Dec. 21.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was the seventh-highest overtime earner in the department, boosting her total salary last fiscal year to $352,462, records show. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Lt. Quathisha Epps was the top earner, pulling in $405,515, including $204,453 in OT. The 19-year veteran of the department filed an EEOC complaint claiming Maddrey exploited her “emotional and financial vulnerabilities, as well as her history of childhood trauma” to “coerce her into performing unwanted sexual favors.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detective Ada Reyes, another top overtime earner who also worked for Maddrey, was transferred to public housing after The Post broke the scandal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ingrid Sanders (center), the ex-driver of the department former top uniformed cop, had her cell phone taken by the feds. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;instagram @nypddcer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She made $42,500 as a new police officer in 2019 but her pay jumped to $154,405 in 2024, including $55,923 in overtime, city records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey’s Queens home was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/ex-nypd-top-cop-jeff-maddreys-home-raided-in-latest-nyc-probe-of-eric-adams-administration/"&gt;raided by the feds&lt;/a&gt; Thursday as investigators probed Epps’ accusations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;resigned Dec. 20&lt;/a&gt; after The Post reached out to him for comment about Epps’ allegations. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch suspended him several days later.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey lawyer Lambros Lambrou said the sex between Maddrey and Epps was consensual and denied allegations of sex-for-overtime, saying his client didn’t approve overtime slips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Maddrey resigned Dec. 20 after The Post reached out to him for comment about Epps’ allegations. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lt. Epps got caught with her hand in the cookie jar and is trying to deflect her wrongdoing by making these allegations against Chief Maddrey,” Lambrou said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Long Island teen who vanished when she got into an unknown car outside her home was found safe aboard a boat on Friday, ending her family’s nearly month-long nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emmarae Gervasi’s family feared that the 14-year-old was being held against her will when she disappeared from their Patchogue home around 5 p.m. on Dec. 9, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gervasi was last seen walking out of her house without a jacket or shoes on and getting into a black car, &lt;a href="https://greaterlongisland.com/missing-patchogue-girl-emmarae-gervasi-14-found-safe-after-18-days/"&gt;according to Greater Long Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security cameras captured her knocking on doors at a Bohemia motel the next day, but she disappeared again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday she was found on a boat in a marina near the White Cap Fish Market in Islip.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Missing Long Island teen Emmarae Gervasi was found safe in Islip on Friday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The marina is located 13 miles west of Patchogue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said Emmarae is in custody and in good health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frank Gervasi said his prayers were answered when police found the teen after 25 days, but did not disclose how Emmarae ended up on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I found Emma!” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/frank.gervasi.96/posts/pfbid04zo86mkdZrH3zvMD9ui4uPDvuLenrmwHPsa73KLEUZp6HxvyhbszC9UbqtiYDUuzl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;he wrote. &lt;/a&gt;“Prayers answered.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gervasi went missing after leaving her Patchogue home around 5 p.m. on Dec 9, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gervasi’s father, Frank Gervasi shared the good news on Facebook Friday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The elder Gervasi said “God gave me a gift today” as he shared a post from the “Together Against Trafficking” Facebook group giving more insight into his daughter’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To address any misinformation: Emma was found in Islip by her father, thanks to a crucial tip. She was not there willingly, and she was overjoyed to see Frank Gervasi when reunited,” Stephanie Rae wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post indicated an ongoing investigation involving multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We deeply appreciate the support and efforts of everyone who helped us find Emma. The love and kindness you’ve shown will mean so much to her once she’s able to process everything,” Rae concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The teen was found on a boat in a canal in Islip. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Friends, family and community members formed search parties to look for Gervasi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Gabby Petito Foundation reached out to Long Island organizations to raise awareness of the missing teen, News 12 reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, Frank Gervasi pleaded for help on social media and searched for leads into his daughter’s appearance himself, driving around Long Island. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;On Thursday — the 25th day since her disappearance — Gervasi’s heartbroken father recorded a video message directed at his daughter. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A missing person’s flyer for Gervasi with a cash award is held during a search for the teen. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Thursday — the 25th day since her disappearance — the heartbroken father &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/frank.gervasi.96/videos/1334084017730266" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recorded a video&lt;/a&gt; message directed at his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Emma, if you hear this video, we love you very much,” he said. “We miss you, and we want you to come home.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emmarae’s mother Melissa Dervay said a weight was “lifted off my body” when the intense search ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The moment I heard her voice and knew she was OK, I felt a weight lifted off my body,” Dervay told Greater Long Island. “I’ve been so tense for the past four weeks, quietly fighting a battle. Now, I’m elated. I feel light, and I just want to scream, ‘She’s OK. She’s been found.'”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudy Giuliani &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/giuliani-appear-court-election-workers-demand-his-property-2024-11-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;found himself in the hot seat Friday&lt;/a&gt;, when he was grilled about his missing possessions — including a $10,000 jersey signed by Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio and his grandfather’s 120-year-old gold pocket watch — as part of a $148 million defamation verdict he still owes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former politician once admired as “America’s Mayor” accused opposing lawyers of asking “abusive” questions in Manhattan federal court during the tense hearing to determine whether he should be held in contempt for failing to turn over assets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there is such a thing as abusive and overbroad, this is the one you’d put in the law school textbook,” snapped the 80-year-old former personal lawyer to President-elect Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rudy Giuliani found himself in the hot seat Friday when he was grilled about his missing Yankees memorabilia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was the latest in Giuliani’s legal saga stemming from a 2023 verdict that found Giuliani was on the hook for $148 million &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/20/news/judge-expedites-148m-payment-from-rudy-giuliani-to-georgia-election-workers-citing-good-cause-he-cant-pay/"&gt;for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea “Shaye” Moss&lt;/a&gt; by falsely claiming the pair tried to steal the 2020 election from Trump.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women are now going after Giuliani’s possessions to satisfy the massive judgment they won.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That includes 26 watches, like his grandfather’s timepiece, a Mercedes &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/us-news/giuliani-forced-to-fork-over-ritzy-nyc-penthouse-yankees-world-series-rings-to-georgia-election-workers/"&gt;once owned by actress Lauren Bacall&lt;/a&gt;, various sports memorabilia and his New York City apartment lease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of those items, lawyers for the two women claim, have yet to be turned over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, I can’t find it,” the diehard Bronx Bombers fan testified about the missing Jackson picture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I went through a divorce, my ex-wife has some of these things. You have every piece of sports memorabilia that I can find.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He admitted that he may have confused the Jackson piece with one featuring Derek Jeter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the notable possessions gone missing is a $10,000 jersey signed by Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That could be,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was blessed by the Yankees, I was blessed with a tremendous amount of memorabilia,” he added. “I get confused about what I have and what I don’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the courtroom, lawyers for the women showed photos of DiMaggio’s famed 1951 jersey hanging above Guiliani’s fireplace months ago — then missing when they visited on Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November, Giuliani’s former lawyer Kenneth Caruso told a judge the jersey and other items were in a locked storage facility in Ronkonkoma, Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the jersey, Giuliani’s Big Apple abode, several Yankees World Series rings are also on the line as assets &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/us-news/giuliani-forced-to-fork-over-ritzy-nyc-penthouse-yankees-world-series-rings-to-georgia-election-workers/"&gt;he must potentially hand over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Once known as “America’s Mayor,” the former Mayor of New York City from 1993 to 2001 accused opposing lawyers of asking “abusive” questions in Manhattan federal court. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked by Judge Lewis J. Liman whether Giuliani knew his grandfather’s more-than-a-century-old watch had to be turned over, the former Big Apple mayor said he placed it in a safe box so it wouldn’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the one thing that means something to me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a break in the hearing Friday, Giuliani asked courtroom sketch artist Jane Rosenberg whether she would make him look “nice,” said Rosenberg, who was documenting the hearing for Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He criticized a drawing Rosenberg made of him in a prior proceeding by scrunching his face into a scowl.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You made me look like my dog,” Giuliani said, according to Rosenberg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Giuliani&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/giuliani-loses-new-york-law-license-after-backing-trumps-false-2020-election-2024-07-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; has been disbarred&lt;/a&gt; for making false claims about the 2020 election and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona that he aided Trump’s failed attempt to overturn his loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Post wires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey federal judge Friday shot down a last-ditch attempt&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/new-jersey-makes-last-ditch-attempt-to-block-nyc-congestion-toll-before-it-takes-effect-sunday/"&gt; to stop New York City’s controversial congestion &lt;/a&gt;toll from taking effect Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Leo Gordon clarified that his Monday ruling — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/mta-gets-ok-to-start-9-manhattan-congestion-toll-following-ruling-hochul-calls-it-massive-win-for-commuters/"&gt;finding that the toll plan&lt;/a&gt; didn’t sufficiently lay out a plan to mitigate the impacts the toll would have on New Jersey — would still allow the toll to start Jan. 5 at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A judge denied a last-ditch attempt to stop New York City’s congestion pricing from going into effect Sunday at midnight. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gordon made his explanation at a last-minute hearing in Newark federal court Friday afternoon, where lawyers for Gov. Phil Murphy argued that the plan shouldn’t be allowed to take effect until after measures are put in place to address the environmental impacts the toll will have on Garden State communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the plan did go forward without addressing the negative effects, it would cause irreversible damage in New Jersey and other local communities, while another delay wouldn’t hurt the MTA, NJ lawyers argued.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The day they flip the switch, there will be irreparable harm … you can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” lawyer Randy Mastro argued, citing how air pollution and chronic disease will skyrocket in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“They are going to suffer air pollution. They are going to suffer chronic illness and that is an outrage. New Jerseyans lives are literally at stake!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The toll will cost commuters $9 during peak hours to drive below 60th Street in Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers with the US Department of Transportation and the MTA assured Gordon they would update their plan to add a more specific framework to shore up the negative impacts on surrounding communities but insisted it shouldn’t hold up the new pricing program from beginning this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MTA lawyer Elizabeth Knauer pressed that the agency has since allocated $9.8 million to local communities in the Garden State – meanwhile, $40 million has been allotted to the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She argued that mitigation efforts are expected to be rolled out over a five-year span, adding that the changes in traffic “will probably not even be noticed” in New Jersey. Knauer said failing to approve the program would deny Manhattanites “clean air.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal Highway Administration attorney Gregory Cummings also blasted Mastro for failing to provide evidence of any immediate harm the new pricing plan would have on residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New Jersey has been seeking to stop the toll, claiming it will disproportionately affect residents in the Garden State.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA will begin charging $9 for passenger vehicles during the peak hours of 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. The drivers will be charged $2.25 during all other times to pass into Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Small trucks will be charged $14.40 during peak hours while large trucks will be charged $21.60.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple’s congestion pricing will be the first of its kind in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York Gov. Kathy Hocul halted an earlier version of the plan that would have charged commuters $15. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people, including cops, firefighters, teachers, politicians and Jersey residents are livid over the plan they say will financially burden those who are already struggling and could also have negative health impacts because of increased pollution in affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the MTA says the new toll will provide a much-needed financial influx to help improve a strained transportation system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congestion pricing had been slated to start this summer until Gov. Kathy Hochul halted it in June, claiming it would disproportionally burden working-class New Yorkers. The toll was initially set at $15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 15-year-old boy was killed and a second teen was injured in a possible gang-related shooting in the Bronx on Friday, according to cops and sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two teens were shot outside 1491 Macombs Rd. in Mount Eden shortly before 5 p.m. and are believed to have been the intended targets, the NYPD and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 15-year-old was struck in his chest and taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plucky elderly woman on her way to a New Year’s Day church service fought back when a violent group of teen girls pummeled her during a botched robbery inside a Brooklyn subway station, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Linda Rosa, 71 – a retired MTA computer operation worker who lives in East New York – got off a No. 3 train at Hoyt Street just after 6 p.m. and had just passed through the turnstile when one of the four girls tried to grab her purse, she told The Post Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And then I [said to myself], ‘Oh, no, this is not going to happen today,’” Rosa said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, another teen tried to grab Rosa’s bag too and said: “Oh, you want to fight?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Linda Rosa, 71, was on her way to church when the teens allegedly tried to rob her inside the Hoyt Street station in downtown Brooklyn. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosa continued holding tight to her purse, which didn’t discourage the young would-be robbers. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The first person kept fighting,” Rosa said. “She punched me in my face and I have my glasses on, and I have a cut on my nose. When she punched me in my face, my glasses flew to the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile the other young lady was still trying to distract me to get my pocketbook or go into my purse, to snatch something out of my purse,” she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The teen ended up grabbing a pocket pouch that held Rosa’s ID and medical records, she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was still wrestling with the first person,” Rosa said. “Then I was trying to kick her in between her legs, but my leg wouldn’t stretch far enough, so I believe that’s when I fell. I fell, and then she stomped on me.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rosa said she sensed that the hostile teens weren’t done yet, so she took action. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rosa fought back, grabbing the teens by the hair, she said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I got an impression in me that she was going to stomp me again, but she was going to aim towards my head,” she said. “So I got up right away, and with that, I grabbed her braids and twirled them around my right hand, and then I pulled her down. She had her head down. Then the other young lady said, ‘Let her go.’ And I said, ‘Oh, no, I’m not letting her go.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The senior yelled out for someone to help her – when she noticed that the second teen had tossed her pocket pouch to the ground and was coming toward her again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So out of nowhere, I grabbed her hair and twisted it around my left hand,” Rosa said. “So I had them both facedown….[like] rams when they’re getting ready to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other girls screamed, “Let them go! Let them go!” but Rosa held on and yelled, “I need assistance! I need assistance!” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moments later, Rosa did let go and started picking up her belongings off the floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The startled teens ran up the steps as Rosa told them she was going to call the cops. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rosa said she forgives her attackers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;DCPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rosa – who retired from the MTA in 2016 after working for the agency for about 42 years – then headed to the nearby Brooklyn Tabernacle Church, where the staff tended to her and called 911. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was taken to The Brooklyn Hospital Center for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rosa said she is thankful she wasn’t hurt worse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thank God they didn’t have no weapons,” she said. “I thank God I didn’t have a heart attack and a stroke and die!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her attackers – seen passing through the turnstile in footage released by the NYPD – were still on the loose Friday, but Rosa said she is already granting them some grace. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I forgive them. They do not know what they do,” Rosa said. “They don’t know what they did. It’s just teenagers acting foolish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack came during &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt;a violent stretch&lt;/a&gt; for the city’s transit system that saw a woman burned to death, a man shoved in front of a train and multiple stabbings or slashings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;It could happen to anybody,” Rosa said of the violence. “Now we’re seeing seniors getting attacked. Anywhere – it can happen anywhere, any station. You could be walking down the street. You could be crossing the street.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s not a good guy who should have a gun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accused NYPD sex pest Jeffrey Maddrey shouldn’t be granted a so-called “Good Guy Letter” that will give him the police retirement perk of firearm access — a ticket to a potential gravy train in private security, advocates argued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police reform advocates — including a former top NYPD chief — pressed Commissioner Jessica Tisch this week to withhold the letter while the soon-to-retire Maddrey &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/ex-nypd-top-cop-jeff-maddreys-home-raided-in-latest-nyc-probe-of-eric-adams-administration/"&gt;is under federal scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; in a sordid sex-for-overtime scandal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“‘Good Guy Letters,’ must only be issued to Uniformed Members of the Service who have demonstrated full service of honor, nobility and ethical leadership,” said Michael Osgood, a retired NYPD deputy chief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey shouldn’t retire with a “Good Guy Letter,” advocates said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any officer who is engaged or more than likely engaged in corruption, sexual assault, sexual harassment, criminal obstruction or any other act that is contrary to honor and nobility must not be issued a ‘Good Guy Letter,’ particularly if that officer is an executive ranking officer.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;NYPD cops who retire honorably are given a Good Guy Letter that exempt them from state firearm possession and carry restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retired cops often parlay their good standing with the NYPD and firearm access into well-paid work in private security and consulting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey temporarily lost his gun access after Tisch suspended him Thursday amid a federal raid on his Queens home by investigators looking into accusations he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;traded sexual favors with an underling&lt;/a&gt; for astronomical overtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Advocates pressed Tisch to not let Maddrey retire in good standing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He had already resigned from his chief of department post and filed for retirement after The Post &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;uncovered the explosive accusations&lt;/a&gt; by Lt. Quathisha Epps, which he denies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps was the NYPD’s top earner last year, raking in $400,000, with overtime accounting for more than half her pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Maddrey’s suspension can only last 30 days without pay, leaving withholding or refusing his Good Guy Letter as the last option Tisch has to make sure he can’t retire in good standing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advocates argued doing so would hold Maddrey — who could dispute the decision — accountable for his alleged abuses and slip quietly into retirement off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By issuing such a Letter to violators of the code of honor and nobility one stains and injures thousands of police officers who serve faithfully with distinction,” Osgood said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lt. Quathisha Epps claims her astronomical overtime was approved by Maddrey after he demanded sexual favors. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reformers also pushed to yank firearm access from Maddrey’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/john-chell-tapped-for-nypd-chief-of-department-replacing-accused-sex-pest-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;successor as chief of department, John Chell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chell in 2008 shot a Brooklyn man in the back, killing him. He contended the shooting was accidental and avoided discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul pledged Friday to stop the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt;runaway train of subway violence&lt;/a&gt; by making it easier to involuntarily commit and treat dangerous mentally ill New Yorkers — but critics quickly blasted her largely detail-free plan as too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a vaguely worded statement, Hochul said she’ll introduce legislation in New York’s upcoming budget to “finally change New York’s involuntary commitment standards.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Currently hospitals are able to commit individuals whose mental illness puts themselves or others at risk of serious harm, and this legislation will expand that definition to ensure more people receive the care they need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor also said she would introduce a separate bill to change Kendra’s Law, “improving the process through which a court can order certain individuals to participate in Assisted Outpatient Treatment while also making it easier for individuals to voluntarily sign up for this treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed changes to mental health laws Friday, but kept details vague. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor didn’t specify whether she’d be supporting existing bills or unveiling newly-crafted legislation. A spokesperson for Hochul said the specifics will be released when she unveils her executive budget proposal on Jan. 21.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“This has been rejected by the legislature in the past,” Hochul said in an unrelated news conference. “It is my sincere hope that everyone in the legislature is paying attention to what is unfolding in our city and in our state, and that we need to ensure that those who are suffering from severe mental illness are getting the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking it on again. I expect to be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s hazy plan in response to the recent wave of subway attacks — including a horrific incident in which a sleeping woman was burned to death, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/guatemalan-migrant-accused-of-torching-sleeping-woman-on-nyc-subway-indicted-on-murder-and-arson-charges/"&gt;allegedly by an illegal immigrant&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/straphanger-in-critical-condition-after-being-shoved-onto-nyc-subway-tracks-in-latest-transit-chaos/"&gt;straphanger shoved&lt;/a&gt; in front of a 1 train — drew confusion, if not outright hostility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) ripped Hochul for failing to properly use Kendra’s Law, implying it — rather than new legislation — could help solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, Holden has unsuccessfully pushed Mayor Eric Adams and his predecessor Bill de Blasio to use the law — which allows family members to petition courts to put their mentally ill loved ones into outpatient care. He has also sought, and failed, to get data on how often it is used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul is gaslighting the public by punting the mental health crisis to the State Legislature under the guise of needing changes to Kendra’s Law,” he said. “The truth is that Kendra’s Law works when properly enforced, but city and state agencies have failed to follow through, and the governor has failed to allocate the necessary resources to make it effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s announcement unfolded on the 26th anniversary of the death of Kendra Webdale, a 32-year-old writer who was killed when a schizophrenic man pushed her in front of a Manhattan train.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shocking attack prompted lawmakers to pass Kendra’s Law, named after Webdale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her brother Ralph Webdale Jr. told The Post he couldn’t comment on Hochul’s proposals without knowing more details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he said that violent mentally ill people attacking straphangers has been an ongoing safety concern for New Yorkers – and questioned Hochul’s belated response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t something that’s new,” said Webdale, who previously spoke to The Post following the fatal subway shove of straphanger Michelle Go in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’d think leadership from years ago and that’s current would do something,” he added. “Until they start taking it more seriously from a legal or financial aspect, nothing is really going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Eric Adams has pushed for more authority to commit mentally ill homeless people against their will. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Stettin, the mayor’s senior adviser on severe mental illness and a co-author of Kendra’s Law, said the biggest issue with the law has been getting more people into care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Too many destitute people are in a “revolving door” mental health treatment where they get arrested or picked up after they stop taking medication or receiving treatment, Stettin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Adams administration wants wants to require each person in psychiatric care to be screened before being released if they are eligible for Kendra’s Law, because many don’t get into the program because hospitals fail to refer them, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what she is proposing today on Kendra’s Law since her statement was vague, but we hope that this is one of them,” Stettin said. “The devil is in the details and we’re anxiously awaiting to see what she proposes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul told reporters that more needed to be done to make sure unwell people with a history of violence actually participate in their Kendra’s Law-ordered &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/assisted-outpatient-treatment.page#:~:text=%25E2%2580%259CKendra's%2520Law%25E2%2580%259D%2520(%25C2%25A79.60,is%2520granted%2520in%2520civil%2520court."&gt;Assisted Outpatient Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There have to be consequences to that,” she said. “We have to have more teeth in those laws.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kendra’s Law is named after Kendra Webdale, who was killed by a mentally ill man in 1999. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor also said her proposal will clear up ambiguities in the state’s existing involuntary commitment law — but was herself ambiguous on how exactly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It only talks about the situation where they’ll do harm to themselves or others,” she said about the existing law. “We are proposing other language that I’ll be introducing in two weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams, who launched the city’s own involuntary commitment plan more than two years ago, praised Hochul for “finally” heeding his repeated calls for state reforms for helping homeless New Yorkers with untreated severe mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With today’s announcement, we are exceptionally grateful to Governor Hochul for listening to our calls and to the calls of everyday New Yorkers, and we look forward to working with her to develop next steps to finally codify these changes into law,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is no dignity in withering away on the streets without the ability to help yourself, and there is no moral superiority in just walking by those individuals and doing nothing. We must stop being so idealistic that we’re not realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams offered up The Supportive Interventions Act — a state Assembly bill sponsored by Edward Braunstein (D-Queens), with the mayor’s backing — as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Hochul spokesman Avi Small told The Post that the mayor’s preferred bill won’t be the legislation that the governor will push. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the governor’s office refused to share details of Hochul’s proposal ahead of her formal roll out, sources said that her plan may take up aspects of Braunstein’s failed bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bill would give more medical professionals the ability to recommend someone to be committed involuntarily, including psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychologists and social workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One source suggested Hochul is supportive of only including psychiatric nurse practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor is also considering tweaks to the law that would allow individuals to have access to services they would receive under Kendra’s Law, without being committed under the legislation, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her statement, Hochul also touted $1 billion in funding for mental health initiatives she and the state Legislature approved in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ralph Webdale III holds a photo of his mother Patricia, left, and his sister Kendra, right.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also stood by her assertion that her deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops in the subway was decreasing concerns about crime underground, without providing any data or evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s approach rankled many lawmakers and advocates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glenn Liebman, CEO of the Mental Health Association of New York, disapproved of Hochul’s vague proposals, arguing that they’re missing the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the response needs to be more multi-faceted to include incentives to ramp up mental health work force, critical incident review panels and funding for institutional health services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think tweaking exiting laws, through Kendra’s Law or other mechanisms… is not the strategy that would be most useful,” he said. “I think that these tragedies are terrible, but we need to have a strong systemic response.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Republican City Council members laid the blame for the subway chaos on lax criminal laws and the closures of psychiatric facilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is all just more smoke and mirrors from Albany,” said Joann Ariola (R-Queens). “Getting people picked up sounds great, but they can only be held for 72 hours and then they are right back on the street wreaking havoc again. We need the state to commit to reopening psychiatric facilities so we can get these people real, long-term care, not three-day timeouts before turning them loose again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councilman David Carr (R-Staten Island) said Hochul’s foot dragging came at the expense of safety in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If people with mental issues are not following their prescribed treatment, then they are danger to themselves and others,” he said. “That is all we need to get these people off the streets and protect both them and the public. It’s absurd this hasn’t been done by now.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx), who is eyeing a run for governor, railed at Hochul, accusing her of dragging her feet in addressing New York’s mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the three years since the shocking murder of Michelle Go, who was shoved in front of an incoming subway car by a schizophrenic, the Governor did nothing to protect the general public from those with severe mental illness,” he &lt;a href="https://x.com/ritchietorres/status/1875187159381983614" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt;. Governing is not about waiting years for more tragedies to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor’s suggestions also drew fire from Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She argued involuntary commitments are routinely done by police and other city officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What exactly happens to these New Yorkers after they are involuntarily committed is not clear and isn’t made publicly available,” she said. “What research does make clear is that coercing people into mental health care is generally ineffective and does little to improve people’s mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The real problem is there are not nearly enough mental health care resources available, especially for those who need them the most and including people subject to involuntary commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vile attacker pummeled a 22-year-old woman and strangled her before attempting to rape her on a Brooklyn street early Thursday, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stranger approached the woman around 2:15 a.m. at Herkimer Street and Saratoga Avenue in Ocean Hill and punched her multiple times in the face, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then pushed her to the ground, choked her and molested her, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is described as a man with a heavy build and a dark complexion, last seen wearing a yellow vest, a black hooded sweater, and black pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city saw an 18.7 percent surge in rapes last year – with 1,736 such reports made to NYPD through Sunday, the latest data available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,462 rapes were reported in the city during the same period last year, the statistics show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYPD Chief of Detectives said in July that the department’s Special Victims Unit, which investigates cases of sexual violence, was bolstering its ranks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have upstaffed the Special Victims Unit tremendously,” Kenny told reporters. “We’re constantly recruiting, we’re getting new talent in, and we’re staffing levels that we hadn’t seen in years, which is going to bring the caseload down, which is going to result [in] more arrests. So we’re really taking it seriously. Special Victims has had a complete turnaround.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information on the latest attack is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald Trump’s bid to toss his “hush money” case was denied Friday by a Manhattan judge — who scheduled sentencing for 10 days before the inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/donald-trump-convicted-of-illegally-fudging-business-records-in-historic-manhattan-hush-money-case/"&gt;kept intact the jury verdict&lt;/a&gt; finding Trump guilty on 34 felonies for concealing a payoff that hid a sex scandal before the 2016 presidential election — rejecting his claim that the case should vanish because voters elected him to a second term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He set Trump’s sentencing for Jan. 10 — noting it was in the public’s best interest to bring closure to the case before Inauguration Day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trump was convicted of 34 felonies for covering up the hush money deal, but the conviction had little impact on voters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Finding no legal impediment to sentencing and recognizing that Presidential immunity will likely attach once Defendant takes his Oath of Office, it is incumbent upon this Court to set this matter down for the imposition of sentence prior to January 20, 2025,” Merchan wrote in a highly-anticipated decision. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is this Court’s firm belief that only by bringing finality to this matter will all three interests be served.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Trump’s lawyers had claimed that Merchan failing to throw out the jury’s verdict would unconstitutionally interfere with the president-elect preparing to serve a second term. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also argued that the conviction should be overturned based on July’s US &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/01/us-news/supreme-court-affirms-absolute-immunity-for-official-acts-in-trump-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Supreme Court ruling immunizing a president &lt;/a&gt;for “official acts” taken in office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial was irreparably “tainted” by evidence jurors heard from Trump’s first White House term, the attorneys claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors fired back that the high court ruling should not apply because covering up a porn star payoff from the Oval Office did not qualify as one of a president’s “official acts.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Merchan said in his ruling that immunity from criminal process for a sitting president does not extent to a president-elect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said in the ruling that Trump was the one who asked for sentencing to be scheduled after the election, and that any claim that “circumstance have changed” as a result of his election win “while convenient, is disingenuous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge said Trump could appear either in person or virtually for the sentencing, where Trump faces anywhere from no jail time to up to four years on each of the 34 counts of falsifying business records he was convicted on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Merchan’s decision follows a legal saga that reached its boiling point with Trump, 78, being diverted from his presidential campaign to sit at a courtroom defense table listening to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/us-news/trump-mouths-bullsh-t-during-salacious-stormy-daniels-testimony-at-hush-money-trial/"&gt;salacious testimony&lt;/a&gt; from ex-porn star Stormy Daniels — who testified to having a brief sex romp with him — and his former fixer Michael Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Judge Merchan insisted that politics played no role in his decisions during the six-week trial. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg used an unusual legal theory and was legally dense — giving critics room to attack it as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/12/opinion/time-to-toss-the-trump-hush-money-case-it-was-always-bogus-after-all/"&gt;what they called a selective prosecution&lt;/a&gt; of the then-frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The prosecution centered on allegations that Trump covered up a $130,000 payout from Cohen to Daniels meant to silence her story about having sex in 2006 with the married real-estate mogul.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jurors saw 11 invoices, 12 digital ledger entries and 11 checks to Cohen — most of which were signed by Trump — that showed the Trump Organization disguising Cohen’s repayments as phony legal services. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bragg’s theory of the case was that Trump’s crimes were multi-layered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor — but doing it to cover up another crime is a felony. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That crime, prosecutors said, was that the payoff was part of an illegal &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/donald-trump-convicted-of-illegally-fudging-business-records-in-historic-manhattan-hush-money-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scheme to hide sex scandals from voters before the 2016 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, where Trump ended up defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jurors saw evidence that Trump worked with Cohen and the National Enquirer magazine to&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/23/us-news/david-pecker-testifies-trump-was-most-eligible-bachelor-at-trial/"&gt; buy up the rights to and bury damaging information about him&lt;/a&gt;, like Daniels’ tale about a brief tryst, and Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal’s tale of a months-long affair with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?” Trump told Cohen in a secretly made recording, appearing to reference a $150,000 payoff to McDougal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bragg’s office claimed that the “catch and kill” payouts breached an obscure New York election law barring “conspiring to promote or prevent someone’s election through ‘unlawful means.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Merchan gave jurors three options for what “unlawful means” then underpinned the election fraud, including that the Daniels payment exceeded a $2,700 federal cap on campaign contribution limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/explaining-how-jurors-were-unanimous-that-trump-fudged-records-and-conspired-to-corrupt-an-election-but-not-on-the-unlawful-means/"&gt;the court did not require jurors to select a specific unlawful means&lt;/a&gt; on the verdict sheet — a confusing move that gave the case’s critics fuel to claim, falsely, that jurors did not “unanimously” convict Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, Trump repeated his mantra that the trial was a “witch hunt” orchestrated by Democrats, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/unpacking-trumps-top-claims-about-why-his-hush-money-trial-was-rigged/"&gt;proclaimed without providing hard evidence that the trial was “rigged” against him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bragg is an elected Democrat, and Judge Merchan, who has insisted that politics have nothing to do with his rulings, donated $35 to Democrat causes in 2020, including $15 to President Joe Biden, records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump spent the six-week trial trashing the proceedings in daily addresses in the courthouse hallway, and repeatedly violating the judge’s limited gag order by slamming witnesses and the jury.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people,” he proclaimed in May, moments after Manhattan jurors convicted him on the 34 falsifying business records counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans consistently told pollsters that the case’s outcome &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/18/us-news/half-of-adults-trump-is-guilty-in-hush-money-case-plurality-say-conviction-wont-affect-their-vote-poll/"&gt;would not affect their vote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, Bragg’s case arguably helped propel Trump to victory. His campaign said that it &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/31/us-news/trump-campaign-raises-whopping-34-8m-overnight-after-historic-hush-money-conviction/"&gt;generated a “record-shattering” $34.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in small dollar donations in the hours after the guilty verdict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Months later, Trump &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/us-news/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election-defying-the-odds-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;won a second presidential term &lt;/a&gt;in an an Electoral College landslide over Vice President Kamala Harris.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Long Island man was charged with animal cruelty for the second time in a month – after he allegedly failed to get proper medical care for his badly battered Kangal Shepherd puppy, who was struck by a car, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Munim Raghid, 26, of Ronkonkoma, was first nabbed on an animal cruelty charge in December for allegedly starving one of his dogs until it became emaciated, according to the Suffolk County DA’s office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During Raghid’s arraignment in that case, Judge Evan Zuckerman ordered him not to own any other animals as his case proceeds in court. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Munim Raghid, 26, of Ronkonkoma, was busted on animal cruelty charges for the second time in a month, the DA’s office said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the puppies was found badly battered in the road, after being struck by a car. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Raghid didn’t comply – and allegedly kept three more Kangal Shepherds – including one found on the road seriously hurt and unable to walk just steps from his home on New Year’s Eve, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A Good Samaritan picked up the helpless pooch — who had apparently been hit by a car — wrapped it in a blanket, and raced it to Atlantic Coast Veterinary Specialists, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young Kangal Shepherd was found to have a fractured pelvis and back legs, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the neighbor who likely saved the pup’s life went knocking on doors in hopes of finding the owner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Raghid kept the dogs in violation of a judge’s order,  prosecutors said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Raghid learned his dog was at the animal hospital, he raced there and took the mangled pup back home – against medical advice, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members of the District Attorney’s Biological, Environmental, and Animal Safety Team (BEAST) executed a search warrant at Raghid’s home on New Year’s Day and found three dogs, including the injured pup, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raghid was arrested and charged with one count of animal cruelty for allegedly allowing the puppy to suffer without adequate veterinary care; and one count of second-degree criminal contempt, for allegedly keeping the dogs against the judge’s order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The puppies are now up for adoption. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I created my BEAST investigative team for a reason,” Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney said in a statement. “We will pursue every act of animal cruelty reported to us and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Raghid was set to be arraigned on the new charges Friday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The wounded puppy – and a second pup found in the home – are now up for adoption through&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Town of Brookhaven Animal Shelter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the battered one must first undergo extensive surgery, the DA’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USPS worker who was slain in a Harlem deli Thursday was enjoying a routine shift before he crossed a crazed woman who spit in his face before plunging a knife into his stomach, witnesses told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ray Hodges had delivered a package just moments before he ducked into his usual lunch spot and became embroiled in an argument with alleged killer Jaia Cruz&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deli worker who was manning the grill said multiple customers tried to separate the pair after Cruz started a verbal argument.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;USPS worker Ray Hodges was spat on by the accused killer, according to witnesses. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stacy Rice/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Ray Hodges] was in the store counting his money to check how much he had to order. She came in after him and she had bags probably from the supermarket. She put her bags by the coffee machine and she came to order,” the employee, who declined to share his name, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He told her he’s trying to order his sandwich and she started arguing with him,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jaia Cruz has been arrested after allegedly stabbing and killing a US postal worker on January 2, 2025, in Harlem. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I told him it wasn’t worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A small vigil was erected outside the scene. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple people who were in the store successfully separated the pair — who the worker said were regulars — but Cruz kept trying to go after Hodges, whose loved ones said was a “great man” and doting father of two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the employee put himself in the middle of the pair to end the fight — which escalated when Cruz hocked a loogie at her victim.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I was in the middle and he was in front of me and she came from behind me and spit in his face,” the deli worker recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That got him mad so he threw the bottle of lemon juice at her.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s when she took the knife and came to him and I had to move.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A postal worker was stabbed and killed inside a deli in Harlem just before 3 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FreedomNewsTV/Ken Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cruz allegedly lodged the blade in Hodges’ neck and stomach, the worker explained, adding that he and other customers called 911.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hodges was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just minutes before the ruthless slaying, Hodges had been speaking with his customers, including 34-year-old Alejandro Alarcon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’s my mailman. Just yesterday, I asked him —- I told him I’m waiting on Under Armor shorts and I asked him to check for me because I didn’t want to go upstairs to get the key. He opened it for me,” Alarcon told The Post Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cops arrive at the scene of the stabbing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FreedomNewsTV/Ken Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then I went upstairs to get the dog to walk him out and when I came outside maybe 15 minutes later, his cart was [in front the deli]. The yellow tape was here. All the blood was everywhere. They had just taken him.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alarcon recalled the mail carrier as a “really nice” man who went out of his way to help his customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Literally over a sandwich? Literally over who ordered first? The person couldn’t let it go?” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The violent slaying has put Alarcon and his neighbors on edge, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I come to this deli all the time. I buy detergent here, I buy coffee here, I buy bagels here— now I’m scared to go into this deli or any deli,” said the Harlem resident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The mayor needs to get on top of this. I had family members that was supposed to come visit me for Christmas and I told them ‘Do not come and visit me because the city is not safe.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cruz has since been charged with murder and is awaiting arraignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — Retiring President Biden will present the Medal of Valor Friday to two FDNY heroes who saved New Yorkers from raging fires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biden, 82, will present the nation’s highest award for public safety officers to&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/23/knock-on-firehouse-door-leads-to-amazing-nyc-rescue/"&gt; Lt. John Vanderstar&lt;/a&gt; and firefighter Brendan Gaffney.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vanderstar rushed into action in October 2022 when a neighbor banged on his Bronx firehouse’s door to alert him to a fire up the street — arriving to hear a woman and child in a fifth-floor apartment who were trapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Firefighter Brendan Gaffney is set to receive the nation’s highest award for public safety officers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FDNY Medal Day Book 2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanderstar “ducked below the fire in his full protective gear and self-contained breathing apparatus and shot down the hallway to the rear bedroom and found an adult woman and a child,” a colleague, Capt. Stephen Elliott told The Post at the time.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He carried the child down the stairs while two colleagues carried the woman. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If [the mother and child] were in that apartment for another minute or two, they most likely had no chance of survival,” Elliot said. “It’s an amazing rescue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lt. John Vanderstar rushed into action in October 2022 when a neighbor banged on his Bronx firehouse’s door to alert him to a fire up the street.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vanderstar “ducked below the fire in his full protective gear and self-contained breathing apparatus and shot down the hallway to the rear bedroom and found an adult woman and a child,” a colleague, Capt. Stephen Elliott told The Post at the time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaffney similarly risked his life in February 2023 when he rushed into a burning apartment building to save an unconscious pregnant woman and child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He first shielded the child with his own body to get him to safety. Gaffney then ran through the fire again and rescued the woman. He performed CPR on the woman while waiting for paramedics. The woman and child both survived,” the White House said in a press release announcing the awards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evening medal ceremony will also honor five Nashville police officers who responded to the Covenant School mass shooting in 2023 and to Lincoln, Neb., police Sgt. Tu Tran saved a woman trapped inside a car from a frigid pond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biden will also award the Medal of Honor posthumously to six Army soldiers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biden will also award the Medal of Honor posthumously to six Army soldiers: Private Bruno R. Orig, Private First Class Wataru Nakamura, Corporal Fred B. McGee, Private First Class Charles R. Johnson, retired General Richard E. Cavazos, Captain Hugh R. Nelson, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The union representing city EMTs and paramedics urged its workers Friday to flee stations in Manhattan’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/new-jersey-makes-last-ditch-attempt-to-block-nyc-congestion-toll-before-it-takes-effect-sunday/"&gt;controversial congestion pricing&lt;/a&gt; zone to avoid getting hit by the $9 toll when driving to work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the first responders are paid just $18.94 an hour — the lowest of any frontline workers citywide — and can’t afford to pay $45 a week just to get to their jobs, said FDNY EMS Local 2507.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York City’s emergency medical first responders are now about to be pickpocketed by a state agency and its new MTA’s driving tax,” said Oren Barzilay, president of the union, which reps 4,100 workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are mandated by our employer, the city, where to work and we have zero option to work remote.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The union repping city EMTs urged them to transfer out of stations in Manhattan’s congestion toll area. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andriy Blokhin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid getting fleeced by the fee, the union encouraged the approximately 270 EMS workers assigned to stations in Midtown and Lower Manhattan to transfer to ones in other parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The congestion pricing toll — set to begin at midnight Sunday — forces drivers entering&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/congestion-pricing-will-cost-up-to-27-to-drive-into-manhattan/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/opinion/new-yorkers-say-gov-hochuls-wrong-wrong-wrong-on-the-border-congestion-pricing-and-everyhting-else/"&gt;Manhattan on 60th Street or below&lt;/a&gt; to pay a peak fee of $9 from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no exceptions for city employees including teachers or firefighters and other first responders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The policy is likely to make parts of Manhattan less safe as EMTs and paramedics avoid the area,  Barzilay warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A union  rep predicted the congestion fee would spark a public safety problem. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;EMTs in the city are paid less than $19 an hour. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;moodboard – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing without exemptions for FDNY EMS is a public safety time bomb waiting to detonate,” said Barzilay. “Mark my words, it will likely have a large, negative impact on public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Business owners have also warned the unpopular fees — forced through by Gov. Kathy Hochul— will affect everyone because they’ll have to raise prices to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of entering the congestion zone is up to $27 in some cases, when added to the fare for crossing by tunnel or some bridges, according to  a map &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/congestion-pricing-will-cost-up-to-27-to-drive-into-manhattan/"&gt;outlined by The Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s in reel trouble now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the founders of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/01/us-news/brooklyn-fish-pond-is-back-just-days-after-fdny-destroyed-original-aquarium-we-are-not-giving-up/"&gt;the Bed-Stuy “aquarium”&lt;/a&gt; built the beloved sidewalk fish pond while out on bail in an attempted murder case — for which he was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hajj Malik Lovick, 48, begged for mercy during the hearing in Brooklyn Supreme Court — playing up his ties to the community, including his role in building the viral makeshift aquarium in a cracked sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He is the founder and daily operator of the Bed-Stuy Aquarium here in Brooklyn,” his attorney, Robert Isdith, said in a bid for leniency. “He created that specific community feature to support the community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hajj Malik Lovick appears in court in his attempted murder case on Friday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lovick was sentenced to 12 years behind bars. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Lovick was convicted following a week-long trial in December of attempted murder, assault and gun charges for shooting a 51-year-old man outside the Lover’s Rock bar in Bed-Stuy on June 15, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was going to have a community. I stopped drugs from going on the corner and they want to give me 15 years,” he said in a rambling speech during his sentencing. “Where is the trust at? There’s no trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His attorney tried playing up Lovick as a caring father and community man — mentioning how held back-to-school backpack drives and goldfish adoption programs — in addition to founding the cherished fish hole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Brooklyn Assistant District Attorney Alejandro Vera mocked the so-called aquarium’s impact on the Bedford-Stuyvesant community, noting that it was built “less than a block away” from where the caught-on-camera shooting took place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have said Lovick and the victim got into an altercation at the bar, and that things had cooled off — before the shooter went to a nearby building to grab a gun and returned, firing two shots at his rival and a crowd of bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hajj Malik Lovick, the founder of the Bed-Stuy Aquarium, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim suffered a gunshot wound to his right knee. Lovick fled the scene and was arrested four days later where a knife was found on him, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Jane Tully seemed dumbfounded by Lovick’s attorney’s bid to play up his neighborhood ties considering he “put that very community in grave danger” by firing a gun into a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He made a conscious, premeditated decision to walk away, to go get a gun and to come back… [and[ fire two shots,” the judge said. “He could have killed [the victim], he could have killed anyone of the many people that were standing on the crowded sidewalk at that time. He put that very community in grave danger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen supporters — including the aquarium’s co-creator Je-Quan Irving — were in the audience for Lovick’s sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mailk was behind viral makeshift fish pond powered by a leaky fire hydrant, which popped up in Bed-Stuy in August. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Bed-Stuy aquarium popped up in the neighborhood in August 2024, with dozens of goldfish swimming in roughly two inches of puddled water in cracked sidewalk underneath a fire hydrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lovick &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/21/us-news/nyc-rally-to-keep-goldfish-swimming-in-hydrant-puddle-through-winter-as-activists-call-it-animal-abuse/"&gt;told The Post at the time &lt;/a&gt;that he’d bought the goldfish from a nearby pet store with Irving and was crowdfunding plexiglass and a filtration system for $5,000 through GoFundMe to protect the fish as the weather cooled down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood favorite — located on Tompkins Avenue and Hancock Street — quickly went viral before the FDNY turned off the hydrant and officials &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/us-news/bed-stuy-aquarium-wrecked-during-fdny-hydrant-inspection-covered-by-cement/"&gt;cemented over the busted sidewalk&lt;/a&gt;, capping the pond and leaving several goldfish to die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But organizers quickly scrapped together a new-and-improved version of the aquarium days later — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/01/us-news/brooklyn-fish-pond-is-back-just-days-after-fdny-destroyed-original-aquarium-we-are-not-giving-up/"&gt;resurrecting the aquarium in a tree pit next to the concrete-slabbed pond&lt;/a&gt; in November that boasted a solar-powered water filter, a titled tank and heater for their fishy friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The goldfish were kept alive during the summer in a small pond near a fire hydrant. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attraction, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/21/us-news/nyc-rally-to-keep-goldfish-swimming-in-hydrant-puddle-through-winter-as-activists-call-it-animal-abuse/"&gt;often criticized by animal activists&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/bizarre-nyc-street-aquarium-closed-because-of-cold-snow-but-locals-say-fish-were-stashed-in-secret-location/"&gt;forced to close &lt;/a&gt;around Christmas when frigid temperatures and snow barreled through the Big Apple — but organizers claimed the fish are alive and swimming in a secret location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lovick was out on bail awaiting trial when he built the so-called aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of second-degree attempted murder, criminal use of a firearm in the second degree and other charges on Dec. 11, 2024, and faced up to 25 years behind bars on the top charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today’s sentence sends a clear message that senseless acts of gun violence have no place in Brooklyn,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The defendant’s decision to open fire over a petty argument not only caused serious harm to the victim but endangered innocent lives in our community,” he said. “This brazen disregard for safety is unacceptable. As Brooklyn reached the lowest number of shootings ever recorded last year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to holding individuals who perpetrate gun violence accountable to ensure our borough remains a safer place for all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lovick’s attorney said he didn’t know what the fate of the aquarium would be with the co-founder in lockup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grieving family of the postal worker who was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/03/us-news/woman-accused-of-stabbing-postal-worker-over-spot-in-nyc-deli-line-has-long-history-of-knife-violence/"&gt;slain in a Harlem deli&lt;/a&gt; remembered him as a “great father, a good person, great man.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ray Hodges, 36, was a dedicated father who worked tirelessly as a USPS mail carrier to provide a better life to his two young sons, his loved ones told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My guy was a good guy. You know what I mean, good brother, you know what I mean. They took one of the good ones from us and all that,” long-time friend, Swagger King, said outside Hodges’ Bronx home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ray Guns was a good kid, you know what I mean, good brother, served the community nice .. He was doing the right thing. He’s coming out of poverty, everybody’s trying to eat. He was at work. That was some wack s–t. We miss you.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hodges’ brother was visibly in pain as he sat outside a makeshift memorial for the slain man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ray was a great father, a good person, great man,” his brother, who didn’t share his name, said. “He was an honorable man. He took care of his family and everybody….respectful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone’s been knotty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mysterious blade-wielding hacker is on the loose in Queens after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/03/us-news/nyc-faces-street-tree-emergency-and-recent-rains-may-not-be-the-end-of-the-trouble/"&gt;slicing up two healthy trees&lt;/a&gt; in what city officials have ominously dubbed an “apparent attempted arboricide,” The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two victims stand next to one another on a quiet Ridgewood street — leaving outraged neighbors hungry for justice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Whoever is doing this just wants attention and they’re a f–king idiot. I would like, if we could, to catch who it is. I would love to see that,” said Joseph Hernandez, 42, who was “shocked” to discover such carnage could have taken place across from his familial home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The gash on the Japanese pagoda runs the slim tree’s entire circumference.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disturbing act was discovered earlier this week during a routine annual inspection of the foliage along St. Johns Road in Ridgewood — which has a history of anti-tree attacks.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The trees — a hulking Pine oak and a much slimmer Japanese pagoda — had each&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/alleged-grand-central-terminal-slasher-wails-for-his-mom-at-first-court-appearance/"&gt; suffered a single deep slash&lt;/a&gt; that ran several inches deep. The crude cuts ran about half the circumference of the oak, but ran the entire trunk of the pagoda, which outraged neighbors said was a relatively new addition to the block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks like it was maybe a chainsaw or something,” speculated Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is like a straight slash and it’s deep. This is deep. It’s not just like you can’t do this with a knife. You’ve got to have heavy machinery to do something like that. And it’s got to be loud. I don’t think you could do that type of damage with a machete.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/inside-queens-only-certified-public-tree-museum-and-its-gangster-past/"&gt;provides us with the way of living&lt;/a&gt;, it’s stuff we exchange oxygen with. You know, so it’s like, why?” seethed Hernandez, a middle school math teacher and dad of two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents suspect the Pine Oak was damaged first. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His wife, Jennifer Castro, was equally disheartened to see the damage both trees sustained — and expressed shock that the tiny pagoda, with just a diameter of 23 inches, was still standing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What’s the purpose? I mean, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/15/us-news/it-may-take-years-for-prospect-park-wildlife-to-return-after-area-torched-by-nyc-brush-fire-experts/"&gt;you destroy the tree or that tree&lt;/a&gt;, and what do you get out of it? What’s the actual purpose of you destroying the tree?” the 45-year-old Department of Education school social worker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trees, which stand next to each other on the south side of the road, are just two of eight on the narrow block. The Pine oak is especially beloved in the Hernandez household since they moved into their home 17 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The pair of trees stand next to one another on St. Johns Road. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This has always been here — it’s one of the biggest trees in the block. I like how they show the age of the block and the community. It shows it’s lasted time and generations,” Hernandez continued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple couldn’t recall when the gnarly gashes first appeared on the trees, but believe that the oak was targeted first and then the bushwacker came back for more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple called on authorities to nab the tree slasher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Joseph Hernandez said the person responsible is a “f–cking idiot.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Whoever is doing this just wants attention and they’re a f–king idiot. I would like, if we could, to catch who it is. I would love to see that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Number one, you’re not only doing harm to the trees — I have kids, I have twins. I don’t want my kids seeing people slashing trees and doing harm to the environment and stuff — like what are they learning?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow St. Johns Road resident Stephanie Sarmiento, 34, theorized the culprit is living among the outraged neighbors — and may have been trying to expedite a tree removal process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Parks Department put “wanted” signs on the trees and implored the public to come forward with any information. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair of trees are healthy, according to city data — meaning they would not be removed unless they were otherwise damaged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If they feel like the tree is harming the pavement or their house, they should call 311, just like I did. I don’t harm my trees,” Sarmiento, a city Health Department worker, said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You need to catch whoever is damaging the trees. It’s horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hernandez promised he would report the culprit to the police if he catches them hurting the trees again. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dorian Geiger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Parks Department is already on the hunt for the culprit for the crime of “apparent attempted arboricide.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wanted” signs have been hung on the sappy victims, imploring the public to turn over information regarding the culprit, with each reading: “This tree has been harmed and we need your help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Daniel Kurzyna, the chief of staff for local Councilmember Bob Holden, the incident is not the first to plague the neighborhood — just a few years earlier a man was fined for hacking evergreens with a machete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Killing or damaging a city-owned tree is considered a serious offense, and is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to 90 days behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our street trees are living and breathing parts of our communities, and a critical piece of green infrastructure in New York City,” Benjamin Osborne, the Parks Department’s Assistant Commissioner of Forestry and Horticulture, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protecting our urban forest is the responsibility of all New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple’s going to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city will be hit by a bone-chilling &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/polar-vortex-to-bring-low-temps-possibility-of-snow-to-the-big-apple/"&gt;cold stretch&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend followed by possible snow Monday morning, meteorologists said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flurries are forecast to begin falling in all five boroughs — and most of the tri-state area — as early as Sunday night, said FOX Weather Meteorologist Cody Braud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re calling for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/first-real-snow-of-the-season-to-hit-nyc-along-with-frigid-temps-ahead-of-holiday/"&gt;snow showers&lt;/a&gt; but keep a close eye to see if it changes, especially as you head to work Monday,” Braud said. “Denser snow could impede travel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up to 3 or 4 inches of powder could pile up throughout the day Monday, depending on how the mid-Atlantic storm forms and moves, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the city will be struck by frigid morning temperatures in the high 20s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The air will be bitterly cold. What’s going to catch people’s attention is the duration,” Braud said — adding the city has suffered through icy mornings for roughly two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before that, we hadn’t seen a stretch of days where we wake up and it’s in the 20s for quite a while.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, temperatures will drop to a partly sunny low of 29 degrees with a high of 36 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be even colder on Sunday with a low of 27 degrees and a high of 38 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the coldest temperature ever recorded in the Big Apple on Jan. 4 was -3 degrees in 1918 and the lowest temp ever on Jan. 5  was -4 degrees in 1904.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The storm is just now forming in the Midwest and as it takes shape we can predict more,” Braud said Friday. “The snow is not a slam dunk yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average snowfall in January in the Big Apple is 8.7 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The woman accused of stabbing a postal worker to death over a spot in line at a Harlem deli has a long history of knife violence — and once threatened “to cut” one of her previous victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jaia Cruz was arrested at least five times before she allegedly carried out the ruthless killing Thursday, law enforcement sources told The Post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In July 2020, Cruz was caught waving an open box cutter at another person in Midtown West and shouting, “I’m going to cut him,” sources said. Cruz was ordered to get on the ground but refused. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jaia Cruz has been arrested after allegedly stabbing and killing a US postal worker on January 2, 2025, in Harlem. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jaia Cruz was arrested at least five times before the attack, according to reports. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cruz was ordered to get on the ground, but refused. She was then pulled away by officers and busted  for resisting arrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just two weeks later, Cruz was arrested again for a 4:30 a.m. tag-team robbery — she and another individual used knives to steal a man’s phone and wallet after the victim invited the pair to “hang out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The repeat offender — who has been described by cops as a transgendered  woman — now faces murder charges for the brutal knifing of Ray Hodges, an on-duty USPS letter carrier who was grabbing lunch at the deli at 168 Lenox Ave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A postal worker was stabbed and killed inside a deli in Harlem just before 3 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FreedomNewsTV/Ken Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cops arrive at the scene of the stabbing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FreedomNewsTV/Ken Lopez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hodges, 36, skipped the line directly in front of Cruz, inciting the knife-wielding woman, sources said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She then allegedly gutted him in the stomach. He was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, cops said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As The Post’s map shows, the cost of entering the congestion zone, defined as entering Manhattan anywhere below 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; street, in a car from Jan. 5 will be significantly higher – between $9 and $20 with an EZ Pass and $13.50 to $27 without – when added to the fare for crossing by tunnel or some bridges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Business owners warn the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/us-news/nycs-new-9-congestion-pricing-toll-everything-you-need-need-to-know/"&gt; deeply unpopular charge&lt;/a&gt; – forced through by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/opinion/new-yorkers-say-gov-hochuls-wrong-wrong-wrong-on-the-border-congestion-pricing-and-everyhting-else/"&gt;Governor Kathy Hochul&lt;/a&gt; and not voted for by any New Yorker – will affect everyone in the city, as they will be forced to pass on their increased costs to customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drivers are about to be slapped with higher costs to enter Manhattan below 60th street, with the new congestion charge and fees for crossing bridges or tunnels.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently over 700,000 vehicles enter the congestion charge area in Manhattan daily, &lt;a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to the Metropolitan Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt;, traveling at an average of just 7mph. With the congestion charge the authority thinks it can reduce that number by around 100,000 vehicles.    &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small trucks such as delivery vehicles will pay a congestion toll around $5 higher during peak periods. Large trucks and tour buses will pay a congestion charge of $21.60 alongside any bridge or tunnel costs during peak period, defined as 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. at weekends.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Those riding in the city’s yellow taxis will also face increased charges, with $2.50 added to any trips which “begin, end or pass through Manhattan south of 96th Street,” for congestion pricing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s yet another major blow to those currently grappling with the high cost of living in New York — already the third most expensive city in the world, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/tour-the-worlds-most-expensive-cities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recent survey by The Economist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Small business owner: Larry Zogby&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delivery service companies are facing an eye-watering increase in costs and expect to be among the hardest hit by the congestion prices, according to several sources who spoke to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a cap of one charge per day applies to cars and motorbikes; trucks, vans and buses will be charged for every crossing into the congestion zone, &lt;a href="https://new.mta.info/document/138931"&gt;according to the MTA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Larry Zogby told The Post he is “furious” that authorities aren’t listening to his – and other small business owners’ – concerns about congestion pricing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Larry Zogby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rdsdelivery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RDS Delivery Service&lt;/a&gt; president and CEO Larry Zogby claimed congestion pricing will cost his business, run out of Long Island City in Queens to all New York boroughs, more than a million dollars annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nobody I speak to in business can absorb this so they’re going to take it and pass it right on,” he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “It’ll be my second biggest cost behind payroll, at over $1m pushed to the customer.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s drivers enter the congestion zone more than 40,000 times a year to deliver everything from medical specimens and pharmaceutical supplies to food for senior citizens, according to Zogby.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congestion pricing is aimed at reducing traffic and encouraging people to use public transport, those in favor claim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The money raised via the tolls will primarily be used to upgrade the city’s decaying subway system and buses, according to the MTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Zogby claims the entire plan is “a sham” and says “everyone is swimming in the same s—t”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City sees over 700,000 vehicles enter the congestion zone below 60th street in Manhattan on weekdays, and vehicles average a speed under 10mph.    &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a money grab,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They don’t consider small commercial businesses with trucks and vans. More thought should have been put into this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are 10 lawsuits currently pending against the tolling program in federal and state courts in New York and New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People … need to brace themselves and be prepared for the impact,” Zogby said, adding: “Because it’s the customer who gets screwed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefighters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An FDNY probationary firefighter, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity, said the general consensus among his colleagues is that they’re “being taxed to work” in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would normally drive into work but the expense is a lot more than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Very few people in my academy class wanted to get assigned downtown because of congestion pricing but we don’t get to pick where we go. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a large portion of my pay and an unfair cost.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the source said he will no longer drive his car into Manhattan to carry out his job, there are no reasonable alternatives, according to him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;FDNY union boss Andrew Ansboro told The Post that many firefighters use their own cars to move from one firehouse to another with all of their gear. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fdny_ufa/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Traffic and congestion are a constant on NYC streets across Manhattan, often accompanied by the sound of car horns. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I take the train into work from Long Island, I frequently get sent to another firehouse as that’s part of the job, but I won’t be bringing in my car anymore because of the expense, so I’d have to walk with 40-60lbs of gear or take an Uber,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In your firehouse you have your own locker so it’s stored there so if you get reassigned to another firehouse or send across town you have to take all of that with you. Every day a couple hundred FDNY firefighters are reassigned to another firehouse to fill in as needed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“(That includes) pants, jackets, boots and helmet are a minimum of 45lbs for a small person. Then you have your own personal tools: screwdriver, wrench, hose wrench. You also have to be prepared to de-contaminate after a fire so have to bring your toiletries and a spare set of clothing, towel, soap and shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of these things going to have to be carried from one point to another and when the weather is bad, like in a blizzard, or the city is jammed by traffic — how are we supposed to get from point A to point B?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple’s firefighters’ union boss anticipates the pricing will have a catastrophic effect on the city’s firefighters, who use their own cars to move themselves and work equipment between their homes and various firehouses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A huge portion of city fire are going to be lugging 80lbs of gear on subways to get from one firehouse to another because they can’t bring their own vehicles in anymore,” FDNY &lt;a href="https://ufanyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uniformed Firefighters Association&lt;/a&gt; of Greater New York president Andrew Ansbro told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The equipment is covered in dangerous carcinogens that are unsafe to carry on public transit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And the last thing any New Yorker wants is a firefighter who is worn out before they even get to work when you then need them to come and save your life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City has struggeld with traffic for decades and is one of the busiest and most congested cities in the US  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The firefighters union has called on the MTA to exempt members from paying the $15 toll when driving their personal cars to firehouses within the zone below 60th Street. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it has so far been unsuccessful, with the MTA putting the onus on the FDNY to provide company cars to employees who need them or reimburse their work expenses for required travel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The law is clear, personal vehicles not considered emergency vehicles,” Ansbro continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the FDNY were to designate emergency vehicles that would solve the problem, or we would have to work something out with members to reimburse them for using their own vehicles, but for now it leaves New York firefighters at a great disadvantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooklyn plumber:  Paul Belli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paul Belli, a small business owner in Brooklyn, said he’s also concerned about the ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone I know in the plumbing industry is planning on passing the cost along to the customers by increasing prices or adding a surcharge which is what we’re going to have to do as well,” he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Belli, president of &lt;a href="https://francobelli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Franco Belli Plumbing&lt;/a&gt;, said he and his team are called to jobs all over the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Small business owner and plumber, Paul Belli, told The Post that most affected companies, including his, will have to add the toll onto the bills of people they service. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Paul Bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Traveling  by car isn’t easy in New York, but for many workers and businesses it is essential. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s plumbers use cars that are all fitted with E-Z Passes paid for by the employer. So it’s Belli’s small, family business started by his late father in 1974, and others like it, that will ultimately feel the pinch of congestion pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We go where people need plumbing work done. I get calls to Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx,” Belli, who is also the company’s licensed master plumber, explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The congestion pricing increase is going to cost the business hundreds of dollars extra a week and we need to be able to make that back somehow so it’s going to be added to the bills of people we service in that part of Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Paul Caminiti drives from Staten Island to work in the East Village and will be impacted by congestion pricing. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brian Zak/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Paul Caminiti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Paul Caminiti regularly commutes from his home in Staten Island to the East Village where he works as a teacher. He drives to and from the school each day because the trip is 40 minutes each way by car compared to 90 minutes on public transport, according to him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[I pay] about $13 a day, sometimes $20 to get from Staten Island to the East Village with no real reliable buses or trains to get to,” he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now we’ll have to pay extra because of an idiot governor. She clearly can’t read a room. $9 Is too much… I will not vote for her or any other idiot that goes for congestion pricing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congestion pricing exists in several other major cities worldwide, including London, Milan and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A social media influencer and singer says he was almost killed after a violent stabbing broke out in the subway car he was riding in early New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TikToker Chris Olsen says he was on the subway with his friend when two men began shouting at each other, something he thought would be another ordinary verbal dispute on the New York City subway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We just witnessed basically a stabbing and almost died on the subway ourselves,” Olsen said in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chris/video/7455102640083504427" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a video posted&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok on Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tiktoker Chris Olsen and his friend Cara say they survived a stabbing inside a NYC subway on New Year’s Day. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/chris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olsen – who says he rides the subway “all the time” – wasn’t phased by the screaming match but his out-of-town friend Cara got “a little nervous” — still, he reassured her everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one of the unidentified straphangers pulled out “a really big knife” as the back-and-forth yelling continued.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Unaware of the impending danger, Olsen, Cara and the remainder of the passengers stayed seated in the subway car until the guy “behind” them rushed towards the other man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And every single person on the train gets up and starts running right at Cara and I because we’re near the end of the car,” he said in the video seen over 10 million times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olsen, who was positioned at the door to change cars, used his “adrenaline and untapped superhero strength” to rip the door open as the frantic crowd jumped over to the adjacent car.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Olsen retold his experience while walking a long the streets of New York after the incident. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/chris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The panicked group of straphangers rushed into the other car, causing those inside to start yelling at the commotion as they all raced to the other end to get to the next car in line.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The door in front of that is completely locked, but all we can hear behind us is people screaming, we don’t know if someone has brought out a gun, we don’t know who else has been stabbed,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olsen says he heard screaming in the background as the growing crowd had pushed the friends against a wall with no where to run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One passenger pulled the emergency brake, stopping the train, and sat for what Olsen estimated to be 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frustrated man allegedly yelled at his fellow riders to stop screaming and calm down “because it was just making it worse for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A conductor eventually arrived in the car and opened the locked door, allowing the displaced passengers to enter the next car and sit down before the train moved to the next station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olsen, who boasts nearly 14 million followers on the app, wasn’t deterred from the New Year’s morning experience and was commuting on the train Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Back on the subway to prevent a trauma response from forming,” he wrote on his Instagram story. “Shaking a bit but I survived!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olsen didn’t specify which train he was on, but &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/2-men-stabbed-in-new-years-day-attacks-on-the-rails-as-nyc-transit-violence-continues-cops/"&gt;several stabbings have plagued&lt;/a&gt; the NYC subway system in the fresh new year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two men stabbed each other when a fight broke out in a Hell’s Kitchen train just after 2 a.m. New Year’s Day, &lt;a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/wave-subway-violence-nyc-leaves-residents-edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fox 5 NY reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later in the morning, two more men were stabbed in separate incidents. The first involved a 30-year-old who was knifed on the No. 1 train platform at 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 15 minutes later a 31-year-old man was stabbed in the back on board a northbound No. 2 train at the 14th Street station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both victims were taken to local hospitals with non-life threatening injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops took a bite out of this crime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A saucy vandal who “plagued” a Westchester town with chronic graffiti of pepperoni slices for more than a year has finally been arrested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Henderson, 42, of Yonkers, was busted Dec. 27 for allegedly tagging at least 13 spots around New Rochelle in connection to the “One Slice Please” graffiti trend, &lt;a href="https://www.newrochelleny.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3788" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;police said&lt;/a&gt; in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A graffiti artist spray painted a depiction of a pepperoni slice on over one dozen pizzerias in Westchester County, according to police. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;instagram/onesliceplease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Henderson’s alleged vandalism spree “plagued the city and surrounding areas,” the New Rochelle Police Department said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The millennial allegedly tagged the outside of pizzerias and other sites with a depiction of a pepperoni slice, topped with green lines that are presumably meant to represent oregano and gooey cheese hanging off the edge. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The graffiti vandal was charged with three counts of making graffiti.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;newrochelleny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/onesliceplease"&gt;Instagram profile&lt;/a&gt; with the username “OneSlicePlease” posted over a dozen photos of the trademark slice spraypainted on various pie shops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvcrTA4rkwh/"&gt;screengrab&lt;/a&gt; of a news report covering the unsavory exploits was also posted on the social media account. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One Slice Please” also has a &lt;a href="https://www.1sliceplease.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, where those who prefer to eat with their eyes — and have some extra dough — can purchase a $3,000 framed painting of the branded depiction of pizza the accused allegedly obsessively creates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “movement” is allegedly the work of one determined man who loves pizza more than he hates&lt;br&gt;being considered a vandal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;instagram/iatecornflakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Rochelle police called the arrest a culmination of a year-long investigation that was of interest in part because of the traction the “movement” gained on social media, local media outlets, and influencers in Westchester County, the release states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lose-lose for Big Apple commuters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A top labor boss slammed the Manhattan congestion toll on drivers set to start Sunday, saying the subways are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/there-have-been-attacks-on-nyc-subway-5-days-in-a-row-despite-cops-national-guard-and-even-the-guardian-angels-on-patrol/"&gt;too dangerous &lt;/a&gt;to give commuters another option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To put &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/mta-gets-ok-to-start-9-manhattan-congestion-toll-following-ruling-hochul-calls-it-massive-win-for-commuters/"&gt;congestion pricing &lt;/a&gt;in now is atrocious, disgusting — a real slap in the face,” Phil Valenti, head of the 1,600 member Transport Workers Union Local 106, told The Post Thursday. “The subway system is unsafe right now. Give me a break.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New Yorkers have been forced into a terrible and unfair position,” said Valenti, whose union represents bus and subway supervisors. “You can pay $9 to enter the congestion pricing zone or take the subway, where violent crime is soaring. At least some drivers will be afraid to take the subway, undermining the entire purpose of congestion pricing. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber and Gov. Kathy Hochul are to blame for this absolute mess.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The NYC subway has experienced numerous violent crimes over the past two weeks. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple subway system has been wracked by five straight days of violence amid a spike in transit crime — despite the NYPD, National Guard and even the crime-crusading&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/inside-the-guardian-angels-new-mission-to-take-back-subways-as-new-yorkers-ready-to-fight-back-against-transit-chaos/"&gt; Guardian Angels on&lt;/a&gt; patrol, The Post reported earlier Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The horrifying Dec. 22&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/guatemalan-migrant-accused-of-torching-sleeping-woman-on-nyc-subway-indicted-on-murder-and-arson-charges/"&gt; torching death of &lt;/a&gt;a New Jersey straphanger on a Brooklyn F train was only the beginning of the latest underground crime spree, which has seen five people stabbed or slashed and a 45-year-old straphanger thrown under a Manhattan subway train since Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Valenti rattled off NYPD stats, showing that the 10 subway murders in 2024 was double 2023’s totals. It was also a 233% increase from the pre-COVID period five years ago and the highest in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were 573 felony assaults last year through Sunday, Dec. 29, 2024 – a 51% increase from five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 10 subway murders in 2024 mark the highest in a generation. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA loses $700 million a year from subway and bus fare cheaters, which should be more of a priority that soaking drivers with another toll, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With Governor Hochul’s policies of New York State being a wide-open sanctuary state, we now have the mentality ill from all over the world, who are homeless, walking our streets, taking our subways and killing people randomly,” Valenti said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Riders and workers are not safe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A $9 fee will apply to all passenger vehicles going into Manhattan under 60th street. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA defended subway safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The NYPD has reported the attached full-year crime numbers for 2024, reflecting serious crime down 5.4% for the full year and down 12.6% over 2019, prepandemic,” MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said. “The numbers speak for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MTA Chief Security Officer Michael Kemper said in a statement to The Post, “Thousands of NYPD Transit officers are working every hour of the day and night to make the subway safe, and the record reflects they are making an impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The MTA loses $700 million annually from fare evaders. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I know firsthand that to suggest otherwise disrespects the commitment to transit workers and riders, and real results delivered by those officers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s office said the governor is focusing on affordability and subway crime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul cut the congestion pricing toll by 40%, squashed a potential 25% surge fee, and is fighting every single day to make the subways safer for commuters and transit workers,” a Hochul spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Governor deployed an additional 1,250 uniformed law enforcement personnel to support NYPD’s efforts to protect subway passengers, and she’ll continue working to fight crime and improve public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey is making a last-ditch attempt to block Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s controversial congestion toll — which is set to kick in Sunday for drivers entering Manhattan south of 60th Street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newark federal Judge Leo Gordon is scheduled to hold a hearing Friday after Jersey lawyers asked for clarification of his&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/mta-gets-ok-to-start-9-manhattan-congestion-toll-following-ruling-hochul-calls-it-massive-win-for-commuters/"&gt; 72-page ruling &lt;/a&gt;issued earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His decision appeared to greenlight &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/hochul-announces-nyc-congestion-pricing-to-begin-january/"&gt;the first-in-nation &lt;/a&gt;congestion pricing program despite citing shortcomings on how the US Dept. of Transportation and the MTA addressed environmental mitigation for Garden State communities that would be impacted by the new toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A sign on the George Washington Bridge warning drivers about the upcoming congestion pricing in Manhattan on January 2, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are confident the judge will say it can’t go forward. How can you go forward with a plan the federal court says is defective?” said Bruce Nagel, one of the lawyers for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTA and Hochul say otherwise and are moving ahead with implementing the toll beginning at midnight Sunday — barring a court reversal.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The MTA will charge the $9 toll for passenger vehicles during peak hours, from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. At all other times, those drivers will be charged $2.25.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Gordon said in his Monday ruling that environmental mitigation concerns on the New Jersey side of the Hudson have to be addressed, he did not explicitly call for halting implementation of the toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the defendants erred in not providing enough specifics on measures to mitigate environmental impacts from diverted traffic in Jersey communities compared to New York’s, such as The Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer speaking at a press conference on congestion pricing in Fort Lee on Jan. 2, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sum, the ruling nullifies key federal approvals that should halt New York from collecting the toll, said another Jersey lawyer, Randy Mastro.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Allowing congestion pricing to begin without adherence to [US environmental] mandates would thus cause New Jersey irreparable procedural harm in addition to concrete environmental injuries, even if the tolling was later halted.” Mastro said in the post-decision court filing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mastro argued there’s no harm in delaying implementation of the toll, noting Hochul did just that in June, claiming the burden on working class New Yorkers would be too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The governor originally &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/05/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-considering-delaying-congestion-pricing-report/"&gt;tabled a $15 proposed toll &lt;/a&gt;to enter Midtown — then infamously waited until after the election in November to push a lower $9 commuter fee, set to increase to $12 in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some everyday New Yorkers — including cops, firefighters and teachers — are fuming over the toll, as are Garden State residents and elected leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York has flipped the bird at the judge and said, ‘We’re going to go ahead anyway!” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat whose constituents live in the Hudson communities on the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason why it’s called a lung tax because the judge admits, as I read in what he said, that they have proposed no action to mitigate the effect on children’s lungs, on parents lungs, here in Northern New Jersey. And that’s what we got to get answers to,” added Gottheimer, who is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/nyc-congestion-pricing-toll-is-insane-says-nj-governor-candidate-josh-gottheimer-who-promises-to-fight-controversial-tax/"&gt;running for governor &lt;/a&gt;this year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA defended the toll and blasted Gottheimer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nobody in their right mind should take transportation advice from the New Jersey politicians who have woefully failed to manage transit in their state—while also endorsing higher tolls on their own roads and on Port Authority bridges and tunnels, and higher fares on NJ Transit,” said John McCarthy, the MTA’s chief of policy and external relations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gottheimer claimed that New York state “flipped the bird at the judge” and proceeded with the toll. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Endless litigation over New York’s program to improve its transit and reduce traffic is the height of hypocrisy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mass transit advocates who support congestion pricing also said it’s time to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After 18 months of litigation and millions of New Jersey taxpayer dollars down the drain, Governor Phil Murphy dares to beg a federal judge for a do-over because he refused to negotiate mitigation measures,” said Transit Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is stiff opposition in New York, where a&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/most-new-yorkers-loathe-kathy-hochuls-congestion-toll-eye-opening-poll-says/"&gt; majority of voters &lt;/a&gt;say they hate the $9 toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;People protesting congestion pricing in front of Federal Court in Manhattan on Dec. 20, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We urge the MTA Board to convene immediately and vote to pause congestion pricing before further damage is done,” The City Council’s Common Sense Caucus said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even former &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/andrew-cuomo-opposes-hochuls-9-congestion-toll-while-mulling-comeback/"&gt;Gov. Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, who muscled through the congestion pricing law in 2019, opposes imposing the toll, at this time&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/trump-slams-hochul-move-to-revive-nyc-congestion-tax/"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump &lt;/a&gt;also opposes the congestion toll and may try to kill it upon taking office January 20, while the outgoing Biden administration approved it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will hurt workers, families, and businesses, but in particular, anything to do with jobs. It is the most regressive tax known to womankind (man!).” Trump said following the November election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 17-year-old boy was hurt in a broad-daylight shooting outside his Brooklyn high school early Thursday — following a bloody night where&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/gang-grudge-may-have-sparked-mass-shooting-outside-nyc-nightclub-during-memorial-for-slain-teen-sources/"&gt; several teens were shot &lt;/a&gt;outside a Queens nightclub, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The teen, who attends the nearby Dr. Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts, was blasted in the stomach around 8:30 a.m. at the corner of Park and North Portland avenues in Fort Greene, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim was taken to Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering Mungo’s connections to the FNO street gang, investigators are probing whether the nightclub shooting may have had a gang nexus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mungo was gunned down only about a block away from where the 17-year-old was shot and wounded on Thursday, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Authorities were not immediately able to say whether Thursday’s shooting was linked to Mungo’s slaying, or the nightclub violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney Letitia James is recusing herself &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ny-prison-guards-beat-handcuffed-inmate-robert-brooks-video/"&gt;from a probe into the death of an inmate&lt;/a&gt; who was allegedly beaten to death by upstate prison guards — as Gov. Kathy Hochul appointed a new head at the facility where the heinous attack occurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AG said her office discovered it has a conflict of interest because of its involvement in unrelated cases defending four of the guards who have been implicated in the killing of Robert Brooks on Dec. 9 at the Marcy Correctional Facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her office is recusing itself from the probe into inmate Robert Brooks’ upstate prison death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of pursing the probe herself, James has appointed Onondaga County District Attorney William J. Fitzpatrick as special prosecutor to take over the case, she said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This decision is not one that was made lightly, but we believe this is the best course of action to protect the integrity of the investigation, and to ensure accountability and justice for Mr. Brooks,” James said in a video address.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Separately, Hochul appointed Bennie Thorpe as the new superintendent of the Oneida County facility, after she removed the prison’s interim head, Danielle Madbury.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that Thorpe — who is the head of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Ulster County — has some 20 years of New York prison experience but has never worked at Marcy gives him “expertise and a fresh perspective on what must be done,” Hochul said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor also said that now that the case has been handed over to Fitzpatrick, she expects formal charges to be mounted and arrests to be made “expeditiously.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Video appeared to show several correction officers beating Brooks while he was handcuffed behind his back at Marcy Correctional Facility. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYS Correctional via NY Attorney General&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Too much time has passed without changes being brought against the individuals responsible,” Hochul said in a statement. “The video of this horrific attack demonstrates that crimes clearly were committed, and I believe initial charges can be brought even as more serious charges are considered based on further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, James released disturbing body camera footage of three correction officers viscously beating Brooks, 43, while he was handcuffed behind his back and offering no apparent resistance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several other officers could be seen standing by doing nothing while the attack was carried out and even after Brooks lost consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she appointed a new superintendent to Marcy Correctional Facility after the horrific beating. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Houston Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brooks was brought to the hospital and declared dead the next day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was serving a 12-year sentencing for first-degree assault for stabbing his girlfriend in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOC has begun the process of firing the officers allegedly involved by placing 13 of them on unpaid suspension. One officer has resigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple subway system has been wracked by five straight days of violence amid a spike in transit crime — despite the NYPD, National Guard and even the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/inside-the-guardian-angels-new-mission-to-take-back-subways-as-new-yorkers-ready-to-fight-back-against-transit-chaos/"&gt;crime-crusading Guardian Angels&lt;/a&gt; on patrol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The horrifying Dec. 22 torching death of a New Jersey straphanger on a Brooklyn F train was only the beginning of the latest underground crime spree, which has seen five people stabbed or slashed and a 45-year-old straphanger thrown under a Manhattan subway train since Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some city politicians, it’s reached the breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Violent attacks have hit the Big Apple subway system over five consecutive days this week, raising concerns.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Wayne Carrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New Yorkers do not feel safe on our subways, despite the nonsense that Gov. [Kathy] Hochul is spouting,” city Councilwoman Joanna Ariola (R-Queens) said Thursday. “We need to prioritize public safety over empty political rhetoric, especially now that Albany is forcing more people into public transportation thanks to their latest congestion pricing tax.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More Guardsmen is great for optics, but what we really need to do is untie the hands of the NYPD and let them start doing their jobs again,” Ariola said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) also faulted lawmakers in Albany &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and at City Hall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every day, we face stabbings, shoves onto tracks, or worse, being burned alive. But Kathy Hochul says she’s ‘making our subways safer,’ and that ‘crime is down,'” he said. “New Yorkers are tired of being gaslit— and even more tired of being assaulted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need an overhaul of city &amp;amp; state leadership. They don’t care about you!” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard troops into the trasit system, but local lawmakers said it’s not working. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Illegal immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is charged with setting a straphanger on fire on a Brooklyn subway train. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Hochul last year ordered more than 1,000 National Guard troops into the transit system in response to growing concerns over subway safety, while Mayor Eric Adams “surged” 1,000 NYPD cops into the underground as well, a rep for the mayor said last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the violence has only increased, starting with the stomach-turning arson &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;death of 57-year-old Debrina Kawam&lt;/a&gt; of Toms River at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station, allegedly by illegal migrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, who is now being held on first-degree murder charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the most recent attack, an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/mta-worker-stabbed-at-bronx-subway-station/"&gt;MTA worker in the Bronx was stabbed&lt;/a&gt; early Thursday morning while heading to work at the Pelham Parkway station — with his assailant still on the loose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other straphangers have been slashed in consecutive days since Sunday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— a 52-year-old man knifed in the arm at the Myrtle-Wyckoff L train station; a 48-year-old man slashed in the neck at the West 50th Street and Eighth Avenue station in Manhattan; and two others on New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kamel Hawkins, 23, of Brooklyn, is charged with attempted murder for allegedly shoving a straphanger in front of a 1 train in Manhattan, police said. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In those incidents, a 30-year-old man was cut in the arm after getting into a dispute with another straphanger at the 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway station, and a 31-year-old man was stabbed in the back at the 14th Street station just 15 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the week’s most shocking transit terror came on Tuesday, when &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/straphanger-shoved-into-path-of-subway-train-idd-as-nyc-music-programmer-joseph-lynskey/"&gt;music programmer Joseph Lynskey&lt;/a&gt;, 45, was pushed into the path of a Manhattan 1 train&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— miraculously escaping with his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/dad-of-suspect-charged-with-shoving-straphanger-into-incoming-subway-train-says-son-started-acting-weird-just-3-weeks-ago/"&gt;NYPD arrested Kamel Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, 23, just hours later near Columbus Circle and charged him with attempted murder and assault in the terrifying &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/straphanger-in-critical-condition-after-being-shoved-onto-nyc-subway-tracks-in-latest-transit-chaos/"&gt;caught-on-video attack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Eric Adams said he has addressed concerns over subway violence by deploying more cops into the transit system &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The NYPD has beefed up patrols in the subway system but have been unable to clamp down, including recent incidents. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Mecea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, police stats show that in the 28 days leading up to Sunday, there were 48 felony assaults in the city transit system, making for a 40% bump over the same period in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased violence prompted the Guardian Angels, the city’s vigilante watchdog group, to announce that it will resume patrols in the subways for the first time since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Angels, founded in 1979 by past mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa, said it will send three-member crews into troubled stations around the clock to root out crime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But so far nothing has eased the concerns among train-riding New Yorkers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a simple cause-and-effect scenario that only requires common sense to be properly addressed,” Said city Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn). “Unfortunately there is no abundance of common sense in our government right now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A terrifying video captured a straphanger shoved in front of a Manhattan subway train, with 23-year-old Brooklyn resident Kamel Hawkins now facing attempted murder charges. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Sam Costanza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed National Guard troops to the subways but is still taking heat for not doing enough.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The violence isn’t going to stop until the powers that be begin to understand pattern recognition and legislate accordingly,” she said. “And the reality is that these crimes are being perpetrated either by illegal migrants or mentally disturbed individuals with priors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Added Councilman Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island), “Maybe all the public safety kabuki theater won’t be necessary if we just go back to arresting and prosecuting bad guys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An on-duty postal worker was stabbed to death in a broad-daylight attack Thursday in Harlem, police and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old victim was stabbed multiple times at the intersection of Malcolm X Boulevard and 118th Street around 2:40 p.m., authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gravely wounded man — who law enforcement sources confirmed was an on-duty USPS worker — was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A convicted child rapist out on parole slashed his ex-girlfriend and then shoved her onto Manhattan subway tracks in front of her teenage daughters, prosecutors alleged Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Blount, 29, grabbed the 37-year-old victim by the hair and tried to slit her throat as she waited for an A train at the 125th Street station around 11 p.m. on Nov. 5, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim tried to protect herself preventing the attacker from reaching her neck as he slashed her face repeatedly with a razor blade, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blount allegedly then shoved the woman onto the tracks — feet away from her daughters, who were able to pull their mom back up onto the platform just 2 minutes before the next train arrived, according to the DA’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was finally arrested on Dec. 28, and was indicted Wednesday on attempted murder and other charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As alleged, Michael Blount brutally slashed his ex-girlfriend before pushing her onto the train tracks in front of her teenage daughters,” District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite what must have been a terrifying attack, one of her daughters was able to pull her mother from the tracks, likely saving her life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right before the chilling attack, Blount had pestered his ex-girlfriend and her kids at a Harlem deli &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the attack, Blount had allegedly pestered his ex-girlfriend and her family at a Harlem deli after repeatedly calling her, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She gave him the cold shoulder and left the store with her daughters, but Blount followed them down the steps to the A-train station, prosecutors charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then returned to the deli and bought a single razor blade — before going back into the subway and trying to kill the victim, the DA’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A bystander called the woman and her daughters a cab that took them to Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital to treat her injuries, which required plastic surgery, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blount is a convicted sex criminal and a registered “sexually violent offender,” state records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was found guilty of raping a 12-year-old girl — a stranger — in Brooklyn in 2013 and served seven years in prison, according to state Department of Corrections records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blount was also charged with robbery and was released in 2020 and on parole until 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pleaded not-guilty in Manhattan Supreme Court Thursday and was ordered held without bail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A riveting new documentary based on The New York Post’s unrivaled reporting delves into the wild manhunt for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-in-court-in-murder-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson/"&gt;alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione&lt;/a&gt; — and how Brian Thompson’s murder touched a cultural nerve about the state of health care in the US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100032830/new-york-post-presents-luigi-mangione-monster-or-martyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“New York Post Presents: Luigi Mangione Monster or Martyr?”&lt;/a&gt; — now streaming on Tubi — offers a rare glimpse into the paper’s bustling newsroom as facts about the chilling Dec. 4 assassination and its aftermath develop nearly in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A new documentary centered on reporting by The Post delves into the manhunt for alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYP/Tubi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Featuring a full roster of editors and reporters from the Big Apple’s favorite tabloid, the fast-paced doc relives the day of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/video-shows-gunman-executing-brian-thompson-at-close-range-as-unitedhealthcare-ceo-stumbles-away/"&gt;Thompson’s cold-blooded murder&lt;/a&gt;, the frantic aftermath as cops hunted for his killer and&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/luigi-mangione-arrest-warrant-details-murder-weapons-charges-for-brian-thompsons-killing/"&gt; Mangione’s dramatic arrest.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nearly hour-long documentary ultimately sets out to “uncover the polarizing Luigi Mangione and his alleged murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson” and examine the heated debate the slaying sparked about the state of health care in America. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The film centers on The Post’s unmatched reporting on the chilling murder case.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thompson was gunned down on West 54th Street in early December just blocks away from The Post’s Midtown newsroom. Mangione, an Ivy League-educated tech whiz who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/luigi-mangione-viewed-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompsons-killing-as-symbolic-takedown-of-parasitic-healthcare-industry-sources/"&gt;railed about the health care industry &lt;/a&gt;in his manifesto, was arrested in Pennsylvania following a five-day manhunt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He now faces state and federal charges, including murder as an act of terrorism and stalking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bloody Wednesday night shooting outside a Queens nightclub that left 10 injured was at a memorial for a teenager gunned down in Brooklyn in October&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and may have been a gang-related hit, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 100 people, most of them teenagers, lined up outside the Amazura nightclub in Jamaica to remember 16-year-old Taearion Mungo, who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/us-news/boy-16-shot-dead-at-nyc-housing-complex-as-youth-violence-engulfs-city/"&gt;was shot dead at the Walt Whitman Houses&lt;/a&gt; public housing complex in Fort Greene on Oct. 26 when gunmen opened fire, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to law enforcement sources, Mungo may have been affiliated with the FNO street gang — or the “For N—ers Only” crew — and Wednesday’s shooting may have been linked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ten people, mostly teenagers, where shot and wounded outside Amazura nightclub in Jamaica on Wednesday night.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gunplay comes as violence has spiked this year within the confines of the NYPD’s 103rd Precinct — which includes the nightclub — with murders, felony assaults and shootings up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police stats show that there were seven murders in the 103 as of Sunday, up from just two last year, while assaults jumped to 780 over the same span compared to 653 over the same time span in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, gunshot victims more than doubled, with 25 victims over that span compared to 12 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We go through this every weekend,” an MTA employee who works across the street from Amazura told The Post on Thursday. “Bullets go crazy. We have to come to work, we don’t know if we are going to go back home. It makes me afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said all of the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/us-news/at-least-10-wounded-in-mass-shooting-outside-queens-nightclub-sources/"&gt; victims shot outside the club&lt;/a&gt; suffered non-life-threatening injuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Amazura nightclub in Queens was hosting a memorial for slain teen Taearion Mungo, who was killed in October.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An evening of celebration ended with senseless violence overnight at a venue in Queens,” Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday. “I want to be clear this incident has no connection to the terrorism investigations elsewhere in our country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we have said, there is no room for this criminal behavior in our city and we are determined to bring these dangerous individuals to justice and get illegal guns off our streets,” the mayor said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to sources, Mungo’s family invited 120 people to the teen’s memorial, but many had to wait outside because the club has a capacity of only 90 — leading to a spillover crowd out front. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wednesday would have been the teen’s 17th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were about 15 people outside around 11:20 p.m. when four gunmen opened fire from the corner of 144th Place and 91st Avenue, the sources said, hitting 10 people before fleeing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Wednesday night shooting at Amazura nightclub in Queens may have been gang-related, sources said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SG For NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It lasted about 10 seconds and then there was silence,” neighborhood resident Juan Alulema said. “I saw people screaming. I saw one woman running into the club. She was screaming someone’s name. There were cars in front of the club so I couldn’t see what she was looking at. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After the shooting I heard two cars,” the 25-year-old restaurant worker said. “They took off very fast.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are probing gang affiliation as “one of the avenues” for the shooting, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no arrests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shooting drew condemnation from Big Apple pols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A bullet hole at Amazura nightclub, where 10 people were wounded in a mass shooting, according to police. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Violence like this has no place in our communities, and we must come together to address the root causes and ensure the safety of our neighborhoods,” said Councilwoman Natasha Williams (D-Queens), whose district includes the club.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am in close contact with law enforcement and community leaders to support their efforts and will work tirelessly to advocate for the resources we need to prevent tragedies like this,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Councilman Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island) blamed the state’s soft-on-crime justice reforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Will any wokesters bet against me that the suspects all have lengthy rap sheets and have been the beneficiaries of bail reform or ‘raise the age’ in the past couple of years?” he said. “Of course not, they won’t want to lose money, but I’m sure they’re fine betting with our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Four gunmen opened fire on about 15 people outside Amazura nigthclub on Wednesday night, police sources said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Mecea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, neighborhood resident Vishal, 28, said security may have been lax at the nightclub. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Usually when they have events they have security and police and lots more vehicles parked outside,” Vishal said. “I came in at 9:30 p.m. and I didn’t see the usual police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“First day of the year,” he added. “What is the rest gonna look like?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was one of the Big Apple’s hottest young rising stars — and she was tragically lost too soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/dead-humpback-whale-washes-ashore-on-long-island-beach/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;humpback that washed up dead in Long Beach &lt;/a&gt;this week has been identified as NYC0393, a playful and spirited cetacean who had become familiar to whale watchers last summer for her acrobatic displays, including some spectacular tail flips in the shadow of the city skyline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were a few trips where it would just be tail throwing — when it throws its entire back body out of the water,” said Chris St. Lawrence of the south Brooklyn research center, Gotham Whale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The humpback whale that washed up on Long Beach this week was frequently spotted in Big Apple waters this summer. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher St. Lawrence/Gotham Whale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We did have this whale super active on numerous occasions . . . It was doing that right in front of the Verrazano Bridge.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whale experts said that the 28-foot-long leviathan was likely killed in a horrific boat strike, as she was missing many of her internal organs and was covered with body trauma “consistent” with such a collision, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/amseasorg?__cft__[0]=AZVM26cFXLQwubG_BpIgtAobjVcgO9ZnJXBfnipF9EhF86AR0D2wuVdD9Y1lNhQo_dxfCJ_9oyMryPAe8rZKy25njeEJLMk_UoZZAlITutj6aKeERNVmTESmh0l7Jz5cDhiSBvvgLidENck2afBSwVJg9B1eIcaIP_ccaHhV1ESflQ&amp;amp;__tn__=-UC%2CP-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Atlantic Marine Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The body of the whale — which had been designated  NYC0393 by researchers — was already in a state of decomposition when it was discovered at Roosevelt Beach Monday. Experts are still working to determine just how long it was dead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the tragic discovery of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/us-coast-guard-issues-boating-alert-after-east-river-humpback-sighting/"&gt;young, popular humpback&lt;/a&gt;, those who knew her recalled the spectacular shows she put on for whale watchers last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Known as NYC0393, the whale was documented 12 times between June and August. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher St. Lawrence/Gotham Whale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The whale had distinctive scarring on its dorsal fin that indicated it had run-ins with boats before its death. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher St. Lawrence/Gotham Whale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would do those tail-throwing behaviors. We also had a day where it was breaching, and we also saw it lunge feeding — when it comes up right underneath that big fish to swallow that whole,” St. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do know this whale was not only feeding, but had the energy and ability to keep doing these acrobatic behaviors, so it definitely seemed like a healthy animal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYC0393 was spotted at least 12 times near the Big Apple between June and August, and she stood out from a rapidly growing humpback population in the area’s waters — as Gotham Whale celebrated as a blockbuster year for whale watching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYC0393 was one of the astounding 100 new whales that the research center cataloged in 2024 — a jaw-dropping sum compared to the measly five that were documented when Gotham Whale started its mission in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other than being known for her Broadway-caliber behavior, the juvenile whale was also the easiest to spot because of its distinctive scarring along its dorsal fin — a harbinger of the mammal’s tragic death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;More than 100 whales entered New York City waters for the first time this year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher St. Lawrence/Gotham Whale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not only were there scars on the dorsal fin, but around the dorsal fin it also had entanglement scars, so there was evidence that it had at one point been wrapped up in lines, whether that’s fishing gear or something else,” said St. Lawrence, 21, adding that other whales in the 400-animal strong catalog have suffered similar injuries, including propeller scars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although celebrated as a sign of a healthy ecosystem, the surging whale population in and around New York City could mean higher cetacean death rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whales tend to follow their food, and experts at Gotham Whale have discovered that baitfish favor the Ambrose Channel — a man-made shipping channel for large vessels traveling to the New York Harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The humpback had injuries consistent with a boat strike, experts said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leebythesea.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York City is such a busy shipping hub and we’ve seen increases in shipping traffic. Knowing that more whales are coming to this dangerous area, it’s only a matter of time when things like this happen,” said St. Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what class of vessel is hitting these whales. It could be anything from these massive cruise ships to smaller fishing vessels. But, we need to consider all the risks and the evidence that we have. We know that whales and boats are interacting in this area with some frequency. And we do expect some of those encounters to go even further than you start and end up killing these whales.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A construction worker fell to his death from the landmark Waldorf-Astoria New York hotel Thursday morning, authorities and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 45-year-old hardhat was found on the ground around 9:40 a.m. outside the luxury hotel on Park Avenue near East 49th Street that has been under construction for years, according to cops and sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He had “injuries consistent with falling from an elevated position,” police said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enfrocement sources confirmed the worker had fallen from the sixth floor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMS workers responded and pronounced him dead at the scene, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A representative from the hotel did not immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a spokeswoman has confirmed that there will be no more postponements – the iconic hotel is set to reopen in the spring of this year, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/15/business/waldorf-astoria-insists-hotel-will-reopen-in-spring-2025-despite-snag-with-online-reservations/"&gt;The Post reported last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock market isn’t the only thing getting a lift from President-elect Donald Trump’s historic election win.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers buoyed by economic optimism under a second Trump administration are fueling a boom in plastic surgery — especially breast implants and liposuction, according to a leading Long Island cosmetic surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Epstein, a dual-board-certified surgeon, said he first experienced a sudden surge in business in late summer — typically his “slow season” — when support for Trump swelled after the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/grateful-defiant-trump-recounts-surreal-assassination-attempt-at-rally-im-supposed-to-be-dead/"&gt;failed attempt on his life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The harrowing almost-assassination was a tide-changing moment in the election that helped &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/us-news/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election-defying-the-odds-again/"&gt;propel a defiant Trump back into the White House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I noticed things were really starting to pick up … And what I was getting a sense is, is that there was a sudden change in consumer confidence, I have no other way to explain it,” Epstein, who owns Oceane Medical Aesthetics and Wellness in Hauppague, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Mark Epstein said noticed a surge in cosmetic surgeries since it became clear Trump would win the election. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Giovannini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The calls about body-enhancing procedures continued to roll in, Epstein said, attributing the boom to optimism about the economy under President-elect Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As it was looking more and more and more like we were going to have a change in leadership in Washington, I think consumer confidence was rising concurrently. And I think that is what brought things back on track. And things have been very, very busy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/majority-of-americans-approve-of-trumps-plans-and-policies-for-the-future-warm-feelings-at-an-all-time-high-poll/"&gt;A recent post-election survey published by Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 60% of respondents indicated they were confident in the 78-year-old president-elect’s ability to make good decisions about economic policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cosmetic surgeries, unless deemed medically necessary, are typically not covered by insurance — and aren’t cheap. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of patients getting procedures is dependent on how much spending money they have available, Epstein noted, which for many Americans has been scant &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/19/lifestyle/achieving-the-american-dream-has-never-been-more-expensive-and-hefty-price-tag-increased-by-1m-in-just-a-year/"&gt;under Biden’s inflation-plagued tenure.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When interest rates are high, the stock market is low, the economy is not doing well – we definitely feel it as aesthetic providers,” the surgeon said, adding that, “under the current administration, the entire aesthetic industry was really, really feeling the depression.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-inflation-price-hike-psychology-c8a3f69b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a recent Wall Street Journal national survey&lt;/a&gt;, released in late October, roughly three-quarters of respondents said the felt costs for everyday goods and services had outpaced household income in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Among the most common procedures are liposuction and breast augmentation, Dr. Epstein said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epstein said that 90-95% of his patients are women, with breast augmentation being the most popular procedure, particualrly among women aged 18-35. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Liposuction also remains incredibly fashionable. Even with weight-loss medicines like Ozempic hitting the market, many patients still want the extra skin removed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of his patients, Lauren, from Long Island, has had a few operations but most recently had a “tummy tuck” procedure done the day after Christmas and ahead of her family’s annual trip down to Florida in January. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lauren, 59, said she made the decision because she wanted to feel like her best self — and with “a better economy” she could fork out the cash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You know, I do have money in the market,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What inspired me was to be a better me. I mean, every year I get older and I want to have a better me and a better feeling of confidence,” the Long Islander added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A recent post-election survey published by Pew Research Center found that nearly 60% of respondents indicated they were confident in Trump’s ability to make good decisions about economic policy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And financially, obviously when you get the [bill], you’re like, ‘whoa, that’s a lot of money’ … but my attitude is you only live once and you can’t take [the money] with you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while going under the knife is a big personal and financial decision, it is also becoming increasingly more popular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reported a 5% rise in plastic surgeries and a 7% increase in minimally invasive procedures in 2023, compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, there has been a significant 10.2% increase in plastic surgery procedures, reflecting a growing acceptance and demand for aesthetic enhancements, according to the ASPS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest boom, Epstein noted, also coincides with the FDA approval on Sept. 26. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/lifestyle/i-got-the-newest-most-trendy-breast-implants-everyone-in-nyc-wants-a-pair/"&gt;of the latest breast implants&lt;/a&gt;, Motiva, made in Costa Rica, which have made him “very busy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Having a new medical device come out that has been so awaited, and coming out at a time when consumer confidence is on the rise, that’s like an explosion,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intruder broke into Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Eric Adams, in a bizarre incident just hours after the city rang in 2025, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Aromando, 20, was arrested inside a bedroom in the mayoral mansion at 4:24 a.m. New Year’s Day, sources told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced on Monday that it settled a lawsuit with Katz’s Deli over violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act at the Lower East Side landmark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kosher-style restaurant agreed to pay a $20,000 fine and improve its facilities for disabled people through a consent decree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The main entrance of Katz’s Deli is not accessible, the restaurant does not provide sufficient dining surfaces for persons with disabilities and despite having been renovated in 2018, its restrooms fail to comply with the ADA,” the U.S. attorney’s office stated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Notably, the consent decree provides for staff to assist individuals with disabilities in using the main public entrance, ensures that the required number of accessible dining surfaces are provided and requires renovations to the men’s and women’s restrooms at Katz’s Deli,” the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorneys-office-sues-and-settles-katzs-deli-ensure-americans-disabilities-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Justice Department stated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1888 as Iceland Brothers across the street from the current deli location, Katz’s bills itself as New York City’s oldest deli and is famous for its towering pastrami-on-rye sandwiches, matzah ball soup and other Ashkenazi staples in what was once the center of Eastern European Jewish migration to the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also widely known for its depiction in the 1989 comedy “When Harry Met Sally….”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During World War II, the three sons of the owners were all serving their country in the armed forces, and the family tradition of sending food to their sons became the company slogan ‘send a salami to your boy in the Army,’” per Katz’s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney’s office said that its deal with Katz’s brings to a close its 13-year “Manhattan Restaurants ADA Compliance Initiative,” which evaluated the accessibility of the 50 most popular restaurants in the borough, as rated by the 2011 Zagat guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An MTA employee was stabbed on a subway platform in the Bronx on Thursday morning in the latest violent incident on the city’s troubled transit system, police and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 47-year-old worker was cleaning the Pelham Parkway Station around 6:10 a.m. when an unidentified man stabbed him in the armpit following a verbal dispute, according to police and sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim was rushed to Jacobi hospital in stable condition, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacker, described as a man in his 50s or 60s in a black hoodie and black pants, fled the station to parts unknown, police said.&lt;/p&gt;

massive amounts of overtime. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maddrey was suspended from the department this morning, as law enforcement agents executed search warrants at several locations, including his residence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post reached out to Maddrey’s lawyer Thursday in the wake of the raids but didn’t hear back immediately.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes after Maddrey — the NYPD’s highest-ranking uniformed officer — abruptly resigned late last month after The Post uncovered explosive allegations he demanded sexual favors from the subordinate in exchange for massive amounts of overtime.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey, at the time, admitted to having a “consensual, adult relationship” with Lt. Quathisha Epps — but denied her claims that he routinely preyed upon her and demanded sexual favors in exchange for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eye-watering amounts of overtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “Lt. Epps got caught with her hand in the cookie jar and is trying to deflect her wrongdoing by making these allegations against Chief Maddrey,” his attorney, Lambros Lambrou, said when the claims first surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps had leveled the allegations against Maddrey in a complaint she filed against the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She alleged Maddrey engaged in “quid pro quo sexual harassment” by coercing her to “perform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps, who held an administrative post in Maddrey’s office, was the NYPD’s top earner in fiscal year 2024, payroll data shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the more than $400,000 she raked in, &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/18/highest-earning-nypd-cop-ot-400k-retires-following-news-expose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;more than half of it was overtime pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALBANY, NY  — Pregnant New Yorkers will be entitled to at least 20 hours of paid leave to attend prenatal medical appointments under a law that took effect Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The new policy entitles pregnant New Yorkers to at least 20 hours of paid leave. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul said the policy makes New York the first state in the country to offer paid leave for prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All pregnant workers in the private sector are eligible for the paid time off. Workers can schedule the paid leave for pregnancy-related medical appointments such as physical examinations, end of pregnancy care and fertility treatments, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This policy makes New York the first state in the country to offer paid leave for medical care. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul pushed for the measure in the state’s last legislative session as a way to help reduce maternal and infant deaths in New York.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“No pregnant woman in New York should be forced to choose between a paycheck and a check-up — and that’s why I pushed to create the nation’s first paid prenatal leave policy,” Hochul said in a statement last month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;All pregnant workers in the private sector are eligible for the paid time off. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Anthony Behar/Sipa USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Employers are forbidden from requesting medical information when a worker requests the prenatal paid leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of anti-Israel protestors gathered in Times Square on New Year’s Day — waving Palestinian flags and calling for “intifada revolution” on the same day a terrorist carried out a deadly car attack in the French Quarter of New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protest — organized by the Palestinian Youth Movement, the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the People’s Forum — was led in a chant of “There is only one solution: Intifada revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One angry protestor shouted that they were going to send&lt;br&gt;people back to Europe. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X/@luketress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The woman shouted back and forth with counter protestors&lt;br&gt;some of whom jeered Hamas in the background. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X/@luketress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re sending you back to Europe you white b–ches,” one female demonstrator wearing a keffiyeh shouted at counter-protestors outside the event, &lt;a href="https://x.com/luketress/status/1874574408846819542"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted to social media shows. “Go back to Europe! Go back to Europe,” she repeated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2024 was a year of struggle against the crime of Zionism,” one speaker shouts through a megaphone in the heart of the Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“We will be here every single year for generation after generation until total liberation and return,” they said, &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hundreds-call-for-intifada-at-new-years-anti-israel-protest-in-times-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Times of Israel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protestors carried signs with messages like “End All US aid to Israel,” “End Zionism,” and “No war on Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Suspected terrorist, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, plowed a pickup truck bearing an ISIS flag into New Year’s Eve revelers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crowd also chanted “We will honor all our martyrs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The demonstration happened just hours after a suspected terrorist, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, plowed a pickup truck bearing an ISIS flag into New Year’s Eve revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/as-death-toll-rises-to-15-new-orleans-terror-attack-one-of-the-deadliest-since-9-11/"&gt; killing at least &lt;/a&gt;15 people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jabbar, 42, was then shot dead by cops in a gunfight. Three improvised pipe bombs were found nearby in the tourist-drawing French Quarter, including one in Jabbar’s truck,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The horrific attack left at least 15 people dead.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FBI is searching for any possible accomplices in the New Orleans attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/inside-shamsud-din-jabbar-jabbars-squalid-home-where-sheep-and-goats-roam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Post exclusively reported&lt;/a&gt; that Jabbar, a US-born military veteran, lived in a trailer-park community in Houston that is home to mostly Muslim immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rundown home is within walking distance of local mosque Masjid Bilal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jabbar traveled to Egypt for 10 days last year, officials told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served active duty in the US Army from March 2007 until January 2015 and was a reservist from 2015 until July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two men were killed and eight others hurt as 2025 kicked off with several slashings and stabbings, and two shootings across the Big Apple, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first homicide of the year, a 50-year-old man was found slashed in the neck around 4:20 a.m. at the corner of West 137th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mario Fowler, 46, was shot dead and a 23-year-old man hurt in front of a building on East 170th Street near Clay Avenue in the Claremont Village section of the Bronx, police said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Bronx deadly shooting happened when someone walked up to a group gathered outside a building and opened fire, cops said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 39-year-old man, described as a person of interest, was taken into custody for questioning, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The motive for the attack is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second slaying came about an hour later when Mario Fowler, 46, was shot dead and a 23-year-old man hurt in front of an apartment building on East 170th Street near Clay Avenue in the Claremont Village section of the Bronx, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fowler, who was blasted in both legs, managed to run into his own building down the block, where someone called 911, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 51-year-old man was knifed in the stomach during a clash around 1 a.m. at 38th Street and 8th Avenue, cops said.
 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Sam Costanza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was rushed to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The younger victim was found around the corner with a graze wound to his chin, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two men were struck when a shooter walked up to a group standing outside the building and opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether either man was the intended target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No arrests have been made in connection to the fatal shooting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two men were stabbed during a fight at West 49th Street and Eighth Avenue around 2 a.m., cops said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another burst of violence, three men, ages 26, 27, and 30 were slashed on the head on Grand Street near Roebling Street in Williamsburg around 4:50 a.m., cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were taken to Woodhull Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The motive for those slashings is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An hour after the iconic ball drop in Times Square, a 51-year-old man was knifed in the stomach during a clash around 1 a.m. at 38th Street and 8th Avenue, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The two Midtown stabbings happened within hours of the iconic ball drop in Times Square. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Bellevue, where he was listed in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further north, two men were stabbed – one in the stomach and one in the hand, as they squared off around 2 a.m. at West 49th Street and Eighth Avenue, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The violence continued in the daylight hours, when a 40-year-old man was shot in the neck around 1 p.m. just outside St. James Park on Grand Concourse near East 192nd Street, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No arrests have been made, and police are still digging for the motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Brooklyn woman who was mercilessly stalked by deranged subway shoving suspect Kamel Hawkins said he terrified her for weeks — and is grateful she wasn’t the one who he eventually put in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It could have been me,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified, told The Post Wednesday. “People always say that you gotta read the red flags, and I’m glad I did. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad” she added. “I don’t wish nothing bad for him. He could have finished school and become an IT tech. He could have left the projects. He could have changed his own story.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kamel Hawkins, 23, is facing harassment charges for allegedly stalking a former Brooklyn gal pal in October. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, Hawkins, 23, was arraigned on attempted murder and assault charges in Manhattan Criminal Court in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/straphanger-in-critical-condition-after-being-shoved-onto-nyc-subway-tracks-in-latest-transit-chaos/"&gt;horrifying caught-on-vide transit&lt;/a&gt; attack on 45-year-old &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/straphanger-shoved-into-path-of-subway-train-idd-as-nyc-music-programmer-joseph-lynskey/"&gt;straphanger Joseph Lynskey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawkins was already facing assault and harassment charges in Brooklyn when he allegedly shoved Lynskey — who miraculously survived despite a skull fracture, broken ribs and a ruptured spleen.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The victim was listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Hawkins’ alleged stalking victim, the two met while studying at Brooklyn Job Corps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said the two started “hanging out” but the relationship never turned romantic — and quickly fizzled out after Hawkins slugged her dog for no reason in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kamel Hawkins was charged with attempted murder and assault this week for allegedly shoving an innocent bystander in front of a Manhattan subway train. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police said Kamel Hawkins was caught on video shoving a straphanger onto the tracks on Tuesday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I went back in the room, like, ‘Did you just hit my dog?’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah, that n—a is wilin.’ Why would you hit my dog? My dog is like my kid,” she said. “After that I let him know I’m not cool with him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the woman said Hawkins didn’t get the message, even after she blocked him on her phone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 9 he showed up at her apartment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Out of nowhere he’s kicking my door. He’s got his ski mask on,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said it continued to happen over the coming days, prompting her to show up at Hawkins’ father’s apartment at Whitman Houses in Brooklyn — to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kamel Hawkins’ former gal pal said he threw bleach at her when she tried to stop him from harassing her. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“‘Tell your son to stop kicking down my door, it’s scary,'” the woman said she &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/dad-of-suspect-charged-with-shoving-straphanger-into-incoming-subway-train-says-son-started-acting-weird-just-3-weeks-ago/"&gt;told Shamel Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;. “‘He’s sending me sexual text messages.’ It seemed his dad more wanted us to move away from the door.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Kamel] comes to the door, same ski mask he’s wearing in the video,” she said. “He threw bleach on me and my best friend. It got in my eye. He’s screaming, ‘You bitches is crazy. I don’t know you bitches.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said the harassment reached a fever pitch on Oct. 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I came outside. I was going to hang out with my boyfriend, and he had the same ski mask, same hoodie from the [subway shove] video,” she recalled. “I pulled out my pepper spray. I told him I’m going to pepper spray you. He picked up a canned drink and threw it at me, ‘You don’t got your boyfriend with you, you don’t got you uncle with you,’ &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I sprayed him, but it didn’t really do anything,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Horrifying video footage shows Joseph Lynskey, center, being shoved in front of a 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s when the woman called the cops and Hawkins was arrested — only to be released without bail on Oct. 20 to enter a court intervention program, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the frightened woman was forced to request an emergency New York City Housing Authority relocation on Nov. 11 and now lives at a different housing complex. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He creeps around,” she said of Hawkins. “You don’t even know where he’s at. One time me and my boyfriend was sitting outside, 2, 3 in the morning, and then he was just walking, like that’s weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to grow like a weed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legal &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/legalized-marijuana-means-strange-new-gifts-for-stoners/"&gt;cannabis industry &lt;/a&gt;will take New Yorkers even higher in 2025, with state regulators projecting the number of new licensed pot stores will more than double — soaring from 275 to more than 625.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, consumers purchased more than $840 million in legal ganga. When factoring in sales from 2023, the legal market has exceeded the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/24/us-news/ny-smokin-it-with-pot-sales-nears-1-billion-mark/"&gt;milestone of $1 billion &lt;/a&gt;in total sales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York cannabis industry regulators are expecting the number of legal marijuana dispensaries to soar in 2025.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP Photo/John Minchillo, File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Office of Cannabis Management said sales in 2025 could exceed $1.5 billion, or about double last year’s haul while law enforcement will expand efforts to padlock illegal stores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the Office licensing approximately 30 dispensaries per month in the last quarter of 2024, we would expect over 350 dispensaries to open in 2025,” OCM policy director John Kagia said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Cannabis industry representatives love that buzz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doubling the number of stores opening in 2025 would be huge. It will help suffocate the illicit operators,” said Joe Rossi, a Park Strategies lobbyist who reps a dozen clients in the cannabis industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s reason to be optimistic. The cannabis industry is starting to turn the corner,” added Rossi, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/06/unlicensed-cannabis-dispensaries-growing-like-weeds-in-manhattan/"&gt;who’s been an outspoken critic of the Empire State’s cannabis rollout&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A legal cannabis dispensary in Manhattan’s East Village. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry regulators are eager to help New Yorkers roll ’em.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While OCM continues to refine its out-year projections with market analysis and feedback, 2025 sales could certainly exceed $1.5 billion,” OCM Executive Director Felicia Reid told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s also significant that entrepreneurs in the market are deeply dialed into consumer tastes and interests, so their adaptability will factor into the pace of market growth as well,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flowered or pre-roll marijuana accounted for 45% percent of sales last year, followed by vapes with 28%,  and edibles, liquids and pills with another 27% combined, according to OCM data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Office of Cannabis Management said marijuana sales in 2025 could exceed $1.5 billion. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency also expects to license hundreds of new cannabis processors and other businesses in the supply chain this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Significant progress was made in shrinking the illicit market in 2024, but black market dealers still pose a vexing challenge to the legal doobie sellers, weed industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State authorities and the New York City Sheriff and NYPD &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/31/us-news/hochul-takes-victory-lap-on-illegal-pot-crackdown-after-her-botched-rollout-opened-the-door/"&gt;padlocked hundreds of illegal shops&lt;/a&gt; after a new state law was approved last spring making it easier to do so.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Our actions remain focused against unlicensed cannabis retailers, which undermine New York State’s ability to build a truly equitable market,” OCM said in its just-released enforcement report to Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Proliferation of unlicensed cannabis shops continues to pose a public health threat as the unregulated products on their shelves are not tested to OCM standards and are often packaged in a manner attractive to youth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OCM said it will “significantly expand” its enforcement efforts to weed out the unregulated market, which includes targeting the networks supplying cannabis to illicit operators in the Empire State.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pot market has been smoking hot in recent months after a rocky two-year rollout marred by lawsuits, a massive illegal market and enormous backlogs in the awarding of retail licenses issued by the often-criticized understaffed and overwhelmed OCM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul last year ordered a management shake-up after a scathing report she commissioned in May &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/10/us-news/damning-internal-report-rips-hochuls-cannabis-agency/"&gt;issued blunt criticism of how the regulatory agency was run&lt;/a&gt; and 64 new staffers were hired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an indication that the smoke is clearing, cannabis industry experts now express concern about too many licensed pot shops opening and cannibalizing each other’s business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One state cannabis official suggested the number of pot shops be capped at 1,600.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to be smart about the rollout,” said Joseph Belluck, chairman of the state Cannabis Advisory Board. “It makes sense to go slow and see what the data tells us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last thing the state wants to see is weed operators opening and then closing because of over-supply, which has happened in other states such as California, Belluck noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A notice on the window of an illegal pot shop closed in Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Billy Becerra / NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a balancing act. The biggest challenge is opening as many stores as possible in a way that is sustainable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The OCM and the policy-making Cannabis Control Board have yet to weigh in on whether to impose a cap on pot store licenses, but they may soon address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With its obligation to help build New York’s cannabis industry, OCM knows the importance of assessing approaches that increase consumer access to legal cannabis, promote public safety, and keep the market accessible — without hypersaturating or destabilizing the supply chain,” executive director Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the optimism, grassy problems remain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OCM , for example, is still playing catch-up with a backlog of applications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency also got slapped with another lawsuit last month, accusing regulators of allowing some wannabe pot merchants to apply for a license without first securing retail locations and notifying local municipalities, as required under the state’s 2021 cannabis law.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A judge imposed a preliminary injunction barring OCM from approving those applications pending a final ruling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul, who took flak for the botched roll out, is claiming credit for the turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Last year, Governor Hochul promised to transform New York’s cannabis industry and took the steps necessary to propel it forward,” a Hochul spokesman said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today, illegal stores that riddled neighborhoods are rapidly becoming a distant memory, legal sales—having just surpassed $1 billion—are skyrocketing, and our communities are beginning to see the impacts of reinvestment. Thanks to Governor Hochul, New York’s newest billion-dollar industry is on course to boom in 2025, and we expect that this will be the year it cements itself as the strongest and most equitable in the nation,” said the governor’s rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple was rocked with a slew of violent crimes that sparked local and nationwide fury this year – from the murder of an NYPD officer to a broad-daylight deadly stabbing spree to the brazen fatal torching of a sleeping woman on board a Brooklyn train. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall felony crime on both the city’s streets and subways declined this year, according to the latest data, updated Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But felony assaults specifically spiked by about 5 percent on the streets, compared to last year, and murders on the rails doubled from 5 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some of 2024’s most shocking crime stories, as covered by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teen migrant allegedly shoots tourist, fires at security guard, NYPD cop &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 15-year-old migrant allegedly shot a tourist while firing at a security guard and later aimed his gun at an NYPD officer in the heart of Times Square on Feb. 8, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Jesus Alejandro Rivas-Figueroa, of Venezuela, and two other teens &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/08/metro/tourist-shot-during-armed-robbery-at-times-square-sportswear-store-sources/"&gt;were allegedly trying to shoplift from JD Sports&lt;/a&gt; on West 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue around 7 p.m. when a security guard stopped them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A tourist was shot in the leg at a JD Sports store by a migrant teen who then opened fire at an NYPD cop on a busy Midtown street, authorities said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s when Rivas-Figueroa pulled out a .45-caliber pistol and shot at the guard — but the bullet inadvertently struck a Brazilian tourist in the leg, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fleeing Rivas-Figueroa then allegedly fired toward a pursuing officer twice, but missed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The teen &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/10/metro/migrant-teen-in-nyc-charged-as-adult-over-times-square-shooting-that-injured-tourist/"&gt;was charged as an adult&lt;/a&gt;, but was required to stay in a juvenile facility because of his age, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYPD cop Jonathan Diller killed during traffic stop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three-year NYPD veteran and married dad Jonathan Diller, 31, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/25/us-news/nypd-cop-shot-in-chest-in-queens-rushed-to-hospital-sources/"&gt;was fatally shot in the line of duty&lt;/a&gt; during a March 25 car stop in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diller had gone to check on a suspicious-looking Kia Soul parked in a Far Rockaway bus stop, where 34-year-old alleged shooter Guy Rivera was sitting with accused cohort Lindy Jones, 41, who was behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Three-year NYPD veteran and married dad Jonathan Diller, 31, was fatally shot by an ex-con earlier this year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy St. Marys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diller spotted what looked like a gun in the pocket of Rivera’s sweatshirt and ordered the ex-con out of the car — only to have him open fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diller – who was promoted to detective posthumously – was struck below his bullet-proof vest and gasped, “I’m hit!” before collapsing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was rushed to Jamaica Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Rivera and Jones were arrested and since have been ordered held without bail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maniac slashes girl, 11, in Harlem spree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lunatic allegedly punched a woman in the face and then &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/10/us-news/street-justice-braying-harlem-mob-surrounds-suspect-in-attack-on-11-year-old-woman-as-nypd-cops-protect-him/"&gt;slashed an 11-year-old girl with a box cutter &lt;/a&gt;in a broad-daylight Harlem spree – before a vigilante mob tried to take matters into their own hands, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shaquan Cummings, 30, allegedly snarled, “B—h, get the f–k out of my way,” before allegedly punching a 43-year-old-woman in the face in front of the 116th Street No. 6 subway station around 2:15 p.m. May 10, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then crossed the street and used a box cutter to slash an 11-year-old girl, who was walking with her mom, on the head — leaving a 7-inch gash right behind her ear, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cops prevented a raging mob of Harlem locals from attacking a maniac accused of slashing an 11-year-old girl in the head in a broad-daylight spree. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Citizen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An irate crowd of locals tried to attack Cummings – who sources said had more than 20 prior arrests – as police attempted to arrest him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He now faces multiple charges, including assault, attempted assault, endangering the welfare of a child and weapon possession, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innocent girl, 7, struck by stray bullet in NYC &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 7-year-old girl &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/11/us-news/7-year-old-girl-shot-in-stomach-in-broad-daylight-in-nyc-cops/"&gt;was struck by a stray bullet&lt;/a&gt; in a broad daylight Nov. 11 shooting on a Harlem corner, authorities and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A bullet pierced the youngster’s stomach as she was walking with her family at the intersection of West 145th Street and Bradhurst Avenue around 2:50 p.m., cops and sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suspects Daniel Idowu, 19, and True Womack, 17, were allegedly aiming towards a group of other people in a potentially gang-linked burst of violence when they inadvertently hit little Fatou Keita, according to prosecutors and sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Suspects Daniel Idowu, 19, and True Womack, 17, inadvertently shot 7-year-old Fatou Keita in a gang-related burst of violence, according to prosecutors and sources. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both teens were charged in separate New York State Supreme Court indictments with second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the younger teen’s arraignment, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Stephen Antignani said the shooting &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/us-news/judge-rips-alleged-teen-gunman-fueled-by-hatred-in-shooting-of-7-year-old-nyc-girl/"&gt;“shocks the conscience of anyone living in New York.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 killed in Manhattan stabbing spree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A homeless man with a lengthy rap sheet &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/18/us-news/two-men-killed-one-woman-critical-in-random-nyc-stabbing-spree/"&gt;senselessly stabbed three people to death&lt;/a&gt; in a broad-daylight spree that spanned the entire width of Manhattan Nov. 18, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramon Rivera, 51, allegedly targeted a 36-year-old male construction worker waiting to be picked up from work, a 67-year-old man who was fishing in the East River, and a woman, also 36 – in the horrific morning attacks spanning from Chelsea to the shadow of the United Nations building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ramon Rivera, 51, allegedly stabbed three people to death in a Manhattan spree because they were “alone” and “distracted,” cops and sources said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rivera chillingly told police later that he chose his victims because &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/19/us-news/suspected-nyc-stabber-who-killed-3-in-chilling-spree-confessed-he-picked-vics-because-they-were-alone-distracted-sources/"&gt;they were “alone” and “distracted,” &lt;/a&gt;sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/nyc-stabbing-spree-maniacs-sick-mission-to-steal-kitchen-knives-before-deadly-bloodbath-revealed-by-prosecutors/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;was indicted on charges &lt;/a&gt;of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder at his Supreme Court arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court, and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Midtown street&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gunman fueled by rage against the health care industry &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/ceo-of-unitedhealthcare-fatally-shot-outside-of-hilton-hotel-in-nyc-in-possible-targeted-attack-sources/"&gt;brazenly executed&lt;/a&gt; UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 50, in a targeted, caught-on-video attack outside Midtown’s Hilton Hotel, where the insurance boss was attending an investor’s conference, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alleged killer Luigi Mangione, 26, who cops say used a ghost gun in the Dec. 4 morning murder, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/person-of-interest-in-fatal-shooting-of-unitedhealthcare-boss-brian-thompson-idd-as-luigi-mangione-an-ex-ivy-league-student/"&gt;was busted&lt;/a&gt; at an Altoona, Pa. McDonald’s less than a week later, following a nationwide manhunt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luigi Mangione, 26, allegedly gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a broad-daylight Dec. 4 hit, authorities said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mangione, who was hit with federal murder, gun and stalking charges, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/luigi-mangione-due-in-nyc-court-monday-in-murder-of-brian-thompson/"&gt;was also indicted &lt;/a&gt;on 11 counts in state court, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism — a rarely used statute — as well as second-degree murder and several illegal gun possession charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migrant arrested after woman set ablaze in subway attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A migrant man allegedly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/"&gt;burned a sleeping woman to death&lt;/a&gt; in a Brooklyn subway horror – and then sat calmly nearby as she was consumed by the flames, according to cops and chilling video from the scene. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, who hails from Guatemala,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/guatemalan-migrant-accused-of-torching-sleeping-woman-on-nyc-subway-indicted-on-murder-and-arson-charges/"&gt; was indicted on first- and second-degree murder &lt;/a&gt;and one count of arson in connection to the shocking Dec. 22 killing of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;Debrina Kawam, 61&lt;/a&gt;, aboard an F train at Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a heinous end-of-the-year murder, a migrant man burned a sleeping woman to death on board a Brooklyn train, authorities said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawam is known to be homeless but originally hails from New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shocking murder prompted the Guardian Angels red-beret-wearing volunteer vigilante squad&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt; to beef up patrols &lt;/a&gt;of the city’s subway system.&lt;/p&gt;

Adorable twin girls born just after midnight</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/nycs-first-babies-of-2025-adorable-twin-girls-born-just-after-midnight/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;They rang in the New Year with a double dose of cheer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adorable twin girls born in Brooklyn just after midnight were among New York City’s first babies of 2025, hospitals said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proud parent Sheneece Crumbie, of Crown Heights, gave birth to the yet-to-be named little ones shortly after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/nyc-new-years-eve-revelers-unfazed-by-rain-to-welcome-2025-in-times-square/"&gt;the ball dropped&lt;/a&gt; at 12:01 and 12:02 a.m., according to NYC Health + Hospitals’ Kings County branch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sheneece Crumbie’s first twin daughter was born at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYC Health + Hospitals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The second twin was born at 12:02 a.m. on Jan. 1 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYC Health + Hospitals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first bundle of joy weighed a sturdy 6 pounds, 13.9 ounces, while the second was 5 pounds., 15.4 ounces, the hospital said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The girls were Crumbie’s third and fourth child with partner, Jordan Tomlinson. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the delivery, a healthy baby boy weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces, was delivered at 12:14 a.m. at NYU Langone’s Tisch Hospital in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents Naomi and Jacob Gottesman, of Rockaway, Queens, had originally expected their yet-to-be named son to arrive on Christmas Eve but he showed up more than a week late, said a rep for the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Naomi and Jacob Gottesman’s 7 pounds, 10 ounce baby boy was born at 12:14 a.m. at NYU Langone Health. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Kimberley Brown called her son, Sidney Cassian Landvall’s, birth “dramatic.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Mount Sinai Health System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, a baby boy named Sidney Cassian Landvall was born at 1:23 a.m. at Mount Sinai West, much to the delight of exhausted first-time mom Kimberley Brown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was quite dramatic,” said Brown, who was in labor for 24 hours, and ultimately had a C-section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was her goal to have the hospital’s first baby of the year, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t believe it,” Brown said. “I manifested it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two men were stabbed within the city’s subway in separate Wednesday morning attacks as transit violence spilled over into the new year, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 30-year-old man got into an argument with another commuter on the No. 1 train platform at 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway around 9:30 a.m., when his rival knifed him once in the arm, authorities and sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Mount Sinai Morningside, where he was listed in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 30-year-old man was slashed in the arm during a feud at the 110th Street-Cathedral Parkway station, cops said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Messerschmidt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether the two men knew each other. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker took off and no arrests have been made. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Less than 15 minutes later and further downtown, a 31-year-old man was stabbed in the back on board a northbound No. 2 train at the 14th Street station around 9:45 a.m., authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Bellevue, and his injuries were also considered non-life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 31-year-old man was stabbed in the back on board a northbound No. 2 train at the 14th Street station, police said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His attacker has also not been caught. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stabbings are just the latest violent incidents to ravage the city’s transit system in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a brute &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/lunatic-accused-of-shoving-commuter-into-path-of-nyc-subway-charged-with-attempted-murder/"&gt;randomly shoved a 45-year-old man&lt;/a&gt; into the path of an oncoming No. 1 train at 18th Street, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;No arrests have been made in either of the attacks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim miraculously survived the harrowing afternoon assault with just a head injury, police said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alleged attacker, Kamel Hawkins, 23, was arrested and charged with attempted murder, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of big, serious news stories last year —  including a heated presidential election, multiple wars raging, and a seemingly endless deluge of mass shootings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With all that heavy stuff dominating the headlines, some of the most fun, strange and fascinating tales can sometimes slip under the radar. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So behold, a round-up of The Post’s weirdest and wackiest stories of 2024. From secret synagogue tunnels to hot dog-eating scandals, there was a lot to make your jaw drop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crimes of the heart! Adultery becomes legal in New York after 117 years&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A century-old law that outlawed cheating on your spouse was overturned by Gov. Kathy Hochul in November — with the pol proclaiming two-timing should be handled by “individuals,” not cops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, unfaithful folks &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/us-news/you-can-now-cheat-on-your-spouse-in-ny-without-fear-of-prosecution/"&gt;faced up to  90 days&lt;/a&gt; behind bars for the class B misdemeanor, which was on the books but basically forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adultery became legal in New York this year after more than a century.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Canal No. 5! NYC sprays ‘Christmas’ scent near Gowanus Canal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city sprayed “Christmas”-scented perfume around the Gowanus Canal to cover up the polluted waterway’s notoriously nasty smell — but residents said the poo-pourri &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/us-news/nyc-sprays-christmas-perfume-near-gowanus-canal-but-waste-site-still-stinks/"&gt;didn’t work&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cinnamon-forward fragrances were unleashed around the perimeter of the “Superfund site” in plan neighbors said totally stunk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Officials tried to mask the Gowanus Canal’s smell with perfume.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Chabad’ boys arrested for digging hidden tunnel to Brooklyn synagogue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A group of 13 young Hasidic Jewish students &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/news/riot-breaks-out-after-secret-tunnel-is-found-under-brooklyn-chabad/"&gt;were busted&lt;/a&gt; in January for digging a secret tunnel to access a famous synagogue in Crown Heights. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The men, who mostly hailed from Israel, began building the 50-foot-long passageway leading to the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters because they believed religious leaders were taking too long to expand its sanctuary, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A group of Hasidic Jewish students dug a 50-foot-long tunnel under a Brooklyn synagogue. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Government overreach, in a nutshell! P’nut the squirrel killed by state officials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;P’nut, the Instagram-famous rescue squirrel, was seized by state officials during an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/02/us-news/caretaker-of-peanut-the-squirrelreeling-over-five-hour-raid-of-his-house/"&gt;hours-long raid&lt;/a&gt; at a farm upstate and euthanized to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/12/us-news/pnut-the-squirrel-was-marked-for-death-and-decapitation-from-the-start-as-rabies-test-comes-back-negative-in-tragic-twist/"&gt;test him for rabies.&lt;/a&gt; The critter’s killing — along with Fred the racoon’s death — became a rallying cry about government overreach among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/pnuts-death-may-have-played-role-in-trumps-victory-owner/"&gt;lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; and right-leaning celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Buns of steal! Nathan’s hot dog eating contest rocked by cheating claims&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheaters are the wurst! Competitive eater Nick Wehry Wehry was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/09/us-news/in-hot-water-cheating-allegations-rock-nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-contest/"&gt;accused of “stealing plates&lt;/a&gt;” from another contestant’s stack to make it look like he’d scarfed down more hot dogs than he actually had at the July 4th competition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Competitive eater  Nick Wehry was accused of cheating at Nathan’s hot dog eating contest. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;rfaraino&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hungry chart! NJ gubernatorial candidate roasted for faking Spotify stats to look like a Bruce Springsteen superfan&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer posted &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/11/us-news/nj-rep-gottheimer-faked-spotify-to-look-like-springsteen-fan/"&gt;a doctored list&lt;/a&gt; of his “most-listened-to” annual Spotify songs online — falsely claiming all of the top five were by Bruce Springsteen. He was accused of fibbing about his fandom to drum up voter support among Boss-loving Garden State residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer posted a doctored list of his “most-listened-to” songs. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;X / @Josh4Jersey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The earth moved for us! Tri-state shook up by biggest quake in 140 years&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most powerful earthquake in 140 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/05/us-news/earthquake-rocks-nyc-tri-state-area/"&gt;rocked the Big Apple&lt;/a&gt;, shaking buildings and sending scared residents bolting into the street. The 4.8-magnitude temblor struck near Lebanon, NJ, in April and was likely felt by up to 42 million people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City was rocked by a 4.8 magnitude quake.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More than 70 migrants found sleeping in cramped NYC basement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dozens of migrant men were discovered  living in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/27/us-news/over-80-migrants-most-from-senegal-illegally-living-in-nyc-basement/"&gt;crowded basement&lt;/a&gt; under a Queens furniture store, where occupants took turns sleeping, officials said. Only 40 of the migrants could  fit in the illegal boarding house at a time — but nearly twice as many were living there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Air head! Russian stowaway sneaks onto Paris-bound delta airlines flight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Stowaway Svetlana Dali, 57,  stuck onto a Paris-bound Delta flight. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Svetlana Dali/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An unhinged  Russian woman breached several &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/world-news/unhinged-russian-stowaway-snuck-into-jfk-and-strolled-past-distracted-gate-workers-before-boarding-paris-bound-flight-prosecutors/"&gt;layers of security&lt;/a&gt; at JFK International Airport then &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/17/us-news/unhinged-russian-jfk-stowaway-svetlana-dali-arrested-again-after-trying-to-flee-to-canada/"&gt;slipped onto a Paris-bound flight &lt;/a&gt;in a bizarre stunt. Svetlana Dali, 57— who had previously tried the same thing at other airports —  was flown back to the Big Apple and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wendy’s plans Uber-style ‘surge pricing’ during peak hours&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fast food chain said it would roll out a new system where burger prices fluctuate&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/26/business/wendys-planning-surge-prices-based-on-fluctuating-demand/"&gt; based on demand&lt;/a&gt; — but customers had beef with the plan. The company later scrapped surge pricing idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The straphanger shoved into the path of a Manhattan subway train is a Big Apple music programmer who is on track to make a full recovery, despite serious wounds such as a cracked skull, his family reportedly said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joseph Lynskey, 45, is also dealing with four broken ribs and a ruptured spleen at Bellevue Hospital after the Tuesday afternoon attack at the 18th Street 1 train station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’s good,” Lynskey’s brother, Christopher Lynskey, told the Daily News as he arrived at Bellevue Hospital. “He’s busted up a little bit but he’s going to make a full recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;According to police, the shove was a random attack. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joseph Lynskey is listed in stable condition at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to his Linkedin profile, the straphanger is head of content and music program at the Manhattan-based entertainment agency Gray V.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he recovered from his injuries, his alleged attacker, 23-year-old Kamel Hawkins, was arraigned on attempted murder and assault charges in Manhattan Criminal Court and ordered held without bail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His father, Shamel Hawkins, told The Post on Wednesday that his son had been fine until he “began acting weird” recently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lately he’s been going through something, some mental issues,” the elder Hawkins said. “We think somebody put something in his weed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The father of the Brooklyn thug charged with shoving a straphanger into an incoming 1 train Tuesday says his son was fine as recently as three weeks ago – but then began “acting weird.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lately he’s been going through something, some mental issue,” Shamel Hawkins, 40 told The Post Wednesday as his son, Kamel Hawkins, was ordered held without bail at his arraignment on attempted murder charges in Manhattan Criminal Court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kamel Hawkins being arraigned on charges attempted murder in Manhattan Criminal Court, Wednesday, the first arraignment of the year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think somebody put something in his weed,” the elder Hawkins said. “About three weeks ago he was alright and then he started acting weird. We wanted to get him help but he returned.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;Hawkins lived in the Whitman Houses public housing complex with his father and brother.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kamel Hawkins, 23, was nabbed near Columbus Circle on Tuesday, just hours after police said he shoved a straphanger onto Manhattan subway tracks in a horrifying random attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;According to police, the shove was a random attack. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 45-year-old victim is seen on disturbing video plunging into the path of an incoming 1 train at the 18th Street station – but miraculously survived with just head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A criminal complaint filed in the case early Wednesday said the unidentified victim suffered four broken ribs, a fractured skull and a ruptured spleen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement sources said the man was fortunate to fall into the “trench” on the tracks beneath the train during the 1:30 p.m. attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hawkins has had several run-ins with the NYPD. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, police charged Hawkins with attempted murder and assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement sources said the accused subway shover has at least three prior busts, including an assault on an NYPD co in Queens in June 2019, when he allegedly body slammed the officer and left him with back injuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who attacks a cop in full uniform is capable of doing far worse to defenseless civilians, NYPD Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry told The Post on Tuesday. “Every time the justice system drops the ball on an assault on a police officer, it puts every New Yorker in danger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim was shoved into the path of a moving 1 train.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawkins also has an open assault, harassment and weapons possession case in Brooklyn from October and has an earlier bust in 2020, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sleeping subway passenger who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;was burned to death on a Brooklyn F train&lt;/a&gt; had aspirations to be a flight attendant and was known for her “million dollar smile,” according to her high school yearbook biography. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Debrina Kawam, known to her classmates as “Debbie” or “Deb,” graduated from Passaic Valley Regional School in Little Falls, New Jersey, in 1985, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/nyregion/coney-island-subway-burning-victim-identified.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawam, 57, later fell on hard times: Sources said she was living in New York City homeless shelters from September until Dec. 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Debrina Kawam, the NYC subway passenger who was burned to death, was known to her classmates as “Debbie” or “Deb,” and graduated from Passaic Valley Regional School in Little Falls, New Jersey, in 1985. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Passaic Valley Regional High School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her horrific death shocked the city — and the nation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is charged with setting her on fire around 7:30 a.m. Dec. 22 on an F train in the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was asleep on the train when she was set ablaze, video shows.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Kawam, who was originally from Toms River, said her memories at the public school were participating in freshman and sophomore cheerleading and that her secret ambition was “to party forever.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She signed off her biography thanking her parents “for everything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawam was one of three students who earned the superlative of “million dollar smile” and “most punk,” according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kawam’s body (seen on fire) was ID’d through fingerprints more than a week after the horrific tragedy. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Zapeta-Calil, 33, was indicted on first- and second-degree murder and one count of arson on Dec. 27.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Curtis Means/POOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawam’s body was ID’d through fingerprints more than a week after the horrific tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zapeta-Calil, 33, who was deported in 2018 but sneaked back into the US, was indicted on first- and second-degree murder and one count of arson on Dec. 27. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed he was too drunk and didn’t remember the attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zapeta-Calil faces up to life in prison without the possibility of parole if he’s convicted on the top count of first-degree murder, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is the most serious statute in New York state law, and my office is very confident about the evidence in this case and our ability to hold Zapeta accountable for his dastardly deeds,” Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘Hi, my name is Debrina, and I want to go see my mom. My mother lives here. I want to talk to her,’” Corpion told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She looked like she was in her 50s, so right away I assumed she was not well, because she didn’t know her mom had moved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m in shock that she was standing right here and then I found out she died so horribly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast for Dry January is looking very wet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend among the sober-curious in the Big Apple has seemingly dried up — with New Yorkers calling the once-hip phenomenon “stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post spoke with more than 100 partiers Saturday night — and only a handful said they had any plans to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/new-years-eve-ball-unveiled-with-whopping-2688-new-sparking-crystals/"&gt;give up the bottle for the next month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New Yorkers enjoying the last weekend of 2024 did not seem eager to participate in Dry January. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Pohl/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am definitely not doing Dry January, that’s not gonna happen,” said Celine DeJesus, 21, a Brooklynite enjoying a friend’s birthday at Verlaine in the East Village in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eight girlfriends said in resounding agreement: “No, no way!”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Standing nearby, Dimitri Bierre’Lius, a 35-year-old firefighter from Rosedale, Queens, said he was not even considering taking a break from drinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am not a quitter,” he quipped to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of interest in swearing off alcohol for the next month could signify the end of the heyday for Dry January — a break that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/01/health/does-dry-january-actually-work-experts-weigh-in-on-new-year-trend/"&gt;experts say improves sleep quality,&lt;/a&gt; contributes to weight loss and leads to an overall boost in mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;About 25% of Americans participated in Dry January in 2024, according to a survey. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;MKPhoto – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend gained traction nationally in recent years, with a whopping 25% of Americans over the age of 21 opting for virgin drinks to start 2024, according to a &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/a-quarter-of-americans-participated-in-dry-january-heres-what-it-could-mean-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study by Civic Science.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The movement has been largely spearheaded by young people, with roughly 35% of abstainers falling into the 21-24 age group last year — a craze that Gen Z New Yorkers seem to be abandoning in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re all college students, there’s no way we’re gonna go an entire month without drinking,” said a young man enjoying beers with his friends at Niagara at East 7th Street and Avenue A in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A young woman added: “What’s the point of doing it just for one month? And then you’re gonna go back to it?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Whiskey Town bartenders Isabella Gmelch and Jordan Kaleh have introduced new mocktails ahead of Dry January. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Pohl/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several barflies told The Post that life is way too stressful to give up their booze, while others said there is nothing better to do in the cold winter months besides drink. Some pointed out that giving up alcohol would remove a massive aspect of their social lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For other drinkers, the popularity of Dry January elsewhere is enough to dissuade them.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s stupid. It’s very popular now, which makes me want to do it less,” said Nick Canfield, 39, a documentary filmmaker, from inside Cerveceria Havemeyer in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another bar patron — an urban planner who asked to remain anonymous — said he had no plans to give up his mezcals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am not going dry. I don’t drink that much. The only time I’ve gone without drinking was when I did hard drugs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Justin K., 35, is refusing to partake in the trend, too, saying he already checked off Dry January once in his lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I did it two years ago to prove that I am not an alcoholic. I realized I don’t have a drinking problem at all and that alcohol is my friend,” he said as he puffed cigarettes with friends outside the Commodore in Williamsburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The turn-away from Dry January could be a good thing for local bars, if not their bar-hoppers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales tanked roughly 40% at more than 350 Big Apple bars thanks to the trend in 2023, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thenycalliance.org/news-item/Dry-January-A-Sobering-Experience-for-NYC-Restaurants-Bars/#:~:text=More%20than%2040%20percent%20of,industry%20again%20demonstrated%20its%20resiliency." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York City Hospitality Alliance survey. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/dry-january-tips-before-after-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ride-sharing app Lyft also said ridership&lt;/a&gt; going to and from bars decreased 10% nationally in January 2024 — the largest drop in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some barflies call the Dry January trend “stupid.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kalim – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sales generally go down in January,” said Isabella Gmelch, a bartender at Whisky Town on East 3rd Street in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The casual bar introduced a mocktail for January called the Snuffleupagus, made from Coca-Cola, grenadine, lemon and grapefruit juice, to try to make up for it. Non-alcoholic options are becoming more and more popular in general throughout the year, the staff noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Dry January has not completely dried up for plenty of New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joe P., who was enjoying a night out at Milanos on Houston Street in Manhattan, said he wasn’t sure he could completely give up drinking but said he might slow down his consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ll dip my toe in, you know? I call it ‘Damp January,’’’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sales tanked roughly 40% at more than 350 Big Apple bars thanks to the trend in 2023, according to a New York City Hospitality Alliance survey. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Pohl/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Allan Perez, 25, has tried Dry January for several years now but has never made it through the full 31 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every year I try. I never last an entire month. Let’s see how far I make it this year,” Perez said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One man told The Post that participating in Dry January has been a frequent topic of conversation among his group of friends, who spend every weekend drinking together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Socially and professionally, there is a lot of pressure to drink every weekend,” said the East Villager and Google employee outside d.b.a on First Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I know some of my other friends are doing it,” said the man, who declined to give his name. “That’s probably the primary reason I am considering it. Like, we’re in it together. If all my friends are on the same page, there might be less judgment and we might do something else together as a group and not go to a bar on Saturdays.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group of friends abstained from alcohol two years ago — a change of pace that forced them to explore other splendors of the Big Apple, such as playing pool, going to museums and trips to Central Park, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dry January might provide the perfect excuse for an alcohol break for the 30-something — who acknowledged he  “blacks out” 10% of the time he drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Drinking lets you forget your anxieties,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An apparently boozed-up luxury home designer crashed his silver Porsche into an oncoming car in the Hamptons on Christmas, cops say — and when asked how much he’d been drinking, allegedly replied, “Just today?’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Porsche driver Edward Yedid —&lt;a href="https://gradenewyork.com/team"&gt; the well-heeled, 46-year-old co-founder&lt;/a&gt; of the posh architecture and design company Grade New York — allegedly told the family in the other vehicle after the crash, “Sorry, my car just drives really fast.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yedid was allegedly speeding on a sleepy East Hampton road around 2:30 p.m. when he swerved into the oncoming lane, according to police records obtained by The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luxury home designer Edward Yedid was arrested on Christmas for allegedly crashing into another car while apparently drunk. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Eugene Gologursky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The married dad — dressed in “head-to-toe designer clothes’’ — smashed his 2021 Porsche Taycan 4S sports car into a 2016 black BMW SUV carrying a family of three on their way to the movies, say the police report and one of the passengers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arianna Thomas, 30, of East Hampton told The Post that she, her partner and dad were “casually driving” along Newtown Lane, headed to see the movie “Wicked,” when “this guy whips around [a corner] in his silver Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We only had a second to react, and he just smashed into us,” Thomas said of Yedid — an author once featured along with his wife &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/realestate/designing-a-home-and-a-marriage-twice.html"&gt;in a 2019 New York Times article &lt;/a&gt;about an Upper East Side fixer-upper they bought for $2.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas said that if not for the quick reaction time of her dad, who was driving, things would have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Her father swerved just in time so that the Porsche struck their car’s left front as opposed to head-on, according to Thomas and the police report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trio and Yedid were all treated at the hospital for minor injuries, according to the report and Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Yedid got out of his car, “We could smell alcohol immediately,” Thomas claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He was wearing head-to-toe designer clothes when he got out of the car, eyes completely bloodshot,’’ the passenger alleged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Yedid was driving this silver Porsche when he crashed into another vehicle with three people in it, according to a police report. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An arrest report said an officer at the scene noticed “the odor of an alcoholic beverage upon [Yedid’s] breath” and that he was “unsteady on his feet” and had “bloodshot glassy eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yedid also “performed poorly on all standardized field tests,” and he “produced a breath sample” and “was subsequently placed under arrest,” the arrest report said. The document did not reveal his blood-alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the crash, Yedid told the family, “Sorry, my car just drives really fast,” Thomas claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The designer also asked the trio if they were OK, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Yedid allegedly performed poorly on field sobriety tests, according to an arrest report. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I told him not to speak to me,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an officer asked Yedid how much he had to drink, Thomas claimed that the driver responded: “Just today?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yedid was arrested and brought to Southampton hospital, where he was eventually released with the instruction to return to the police station Dec. 27 so cops could complete processing his arrest, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was eventually charged with driving while intoxicated, failure to keep right, speed not reasonable and driving an uninspected car.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The married dad crashed while driving on Newtown Lane in East Hampton around 2:30 p.m. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A dad, his daughter and her partner were on their way to see a movie when Yedid allegedly crashed into their car. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was freed and must show up in court for arraignment Jan. 8, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yedid did not return Post messages seeking comment Tuesday. It was unclear if he had a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The designer and his business partner &lt;a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9781580935531/New-York-Contemporary-GRADE-Architecture-1580935532/plp"&gt;wrote a book in 2019&lt;/a&gt; titled, “New York Contemporary: Grade Architecture and Interiors.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yedid also is well-known enough around the uber-tony area to have garnered an interview titled,&lt;a href="https://theinvisiblecollection.com/cool-hot-spots-in-the-hamptons-edward-yedids-favorite-recommendations/?srsltid=AfmBOopsYTQmX_mX_8uEcKZylISOsmmS9OrZjvZhO1hRU92BvpAfOCyN"&gt; “Cool Hot Spots in the Hamptons: Edward Yedid’s favorite recommendations,’’&lt;/a&gt; on the website for the upscale home-goods marketplace the Invisible Collection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Yedid is married with a daughter. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Hannah Turner Harts/BFA.com/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Edward’s Favorites — Dinner at Le Bilboquet, Sag Harbor — elegant, on the water, wonderful food and service, feels like Europe and the ambiance is energetic,’’ the profile says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas said that as for her family, the accident “showed how quickly life could change.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas said she is bruised on her right knee, her partner has a cut on his nose and a bruise on his head and her dad has back pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were in the hospital for Christmas,’’ she lamented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t rain on their ball drop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thunderstorms didn’t dampen the spirits in Times Square on New Year’s Eve as thousands of revelers rang in 2025 with a bang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the festive masses waited in anticipation for the clock to strike midnight, a group of a dozen or so partiers, including Tiffany Lopez of the Bronx, danced to salsa with the raindrops pouring down Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m from New York. And it’s an epic experience — something a New Yorker never does,” Lopez, 41, said gleefully. “You’re in the middle of Times Square. And it’s raining and people are so happy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another group of friends from Japan camped out at 3 a.m. for the perfect spot — right behind the stage in the middle of Seventh Avenue — to watch the ball drop. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the first drops fell from the sky, the six pals, ranging in age from 23 to 27, pulled on their ponchos, not letting the weather ruin the occasion. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re ready for anything,” Natsuki Maeda exclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Nearby, a veteran Times Square New Year’s Eve reveler — decked out in a 2025 foam top hat, 2025 glasses, and colorful boas — shrugged off the stormy weather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[My] eighth year in a row — minus the Covid year,” Tommy Onolfo, 42, told The Post. “I got here at 6 a.m. Not all worried about the rain. I’m a lifeguard and diving board coach in the summer. Water doesn’t bother me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This year wasn’t so good to me so I’m just gonna go day by day,” the Long Island resident said. “It’s already getting better tonight. We didn’t even start the year and it’s already starting off good.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he was looking forward to when the raindrops were replaced with falling confetti over the Crossroads of the World.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no other place to be than on Times Square on New Years especially when the confetti falls,” Onolfo said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ball drop tradition dates back to 1907. The ball weighs 11,875 pounds and is covered with 2,688 crustal triangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four teenagers were arrested Sunday for holding a 13-year-old girl hostage inside a New Jersey hotel room, where they tried to sexually assault her at gunpoint, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police rescued the girl that morning from a hotel on Passaic Avenue in Harrison, where she said she was being held against her will and locked in a room by the group who she said physically assaulted her, the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young victim said the four teens tried to sexually assault her and told cops that they had guns, according to the prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officers recovered two handguns and hollow point bullets during a court-authorized search of the room and arrested the four teenagers, who all reside in Newark. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two 15-year-old girls are facing charges of kidnapping, simple assault, unlawful possession of a weapon, conspiracy to kidnap, attempted sexual assault, possession of prohibited devices (hollow point bullets), and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. One of the girls was also hit with an aggravated assault charge. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Neither has been publicly named because they are minors and both are being charged as juveniles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two 18-year-olds — Tavin McCullough and Kyle Green — were both charged with possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, unlawful possession of a weapon, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession of prohibited devices (hollow point bullets). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Chell has been tapped to permanently replace Jeffrey Maddrey as the NYPD’s chief of department after an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;explosive sex scandal led to Maddrey’s resignation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced the personnel move Tuesday night as well as new official appointments for chief of patrol and chief of internal affairs — all effective immediately. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chell, who had taken over Maddrey’s former job on an interim basis, will now be the NYPD’s highest-ranking uniformed officer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;John Chell served as interim chief of department after Jeffrey Maddrey resigned. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrew Schwartz / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chell’s former post, chief of patrol, was filled by Philip Rivera, the department’s ex-chief of transportation, according to Tisch. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward A. Thompson, a 38-year veteran of the department, was named the permanent chief of internal affairs after stepping in on an interim basis following the ouster of former Chief Miguel Iglesias.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“In 2025, the NYPD will build on the gains of the past year to make every New York City neighborhood even safer,” Tisch said in a statement announcing the appointments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These leaders will ensure we continue to drive down crime and improve quality of life, maintain honor and integrity across the Department, and strengthen the bonds of partnership between the police and the people of our great city.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promotions mark the latest reshuffling atop the nation’s largest police department after a scandal-plagued 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outspoken Chell raised eyebrows and rankled liberals throughout his tenure as chief of patrol, often through his social media account. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chell used X to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDChiefPatrol/status/1786221223027839180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1786221223027839180%7Ctwgr%5E42362cde9191c596e5c60b609194925bad9c5254%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2Fnews%2Fnyc-council-speaker-demands-investigation-into-nypd-social-media-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;jab lefty City Council members&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/NYPDChiefPatrol/status/1776745372808810834" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; and even a judge whom he &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nypd-judge-bail-2b70278d60fcaa6c465b40638f67faaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misidentified as the jurist&lt;/a&gt; who let a “predator” loose in the Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vocal posts by Chell and other NYPD brass under former Commissioner Edward Caban were deemed by City Council leaders as “dangerous, unethical, unprofessional” during a heated proceeding in May.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Maddrey resigned after bombshell sex-for-overtime accusations, which he denied. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Chell appeared to emerge unscathed from the controversy, as well as a series of scandals that forced many of his close NYPD colleagues and superiors from the department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caban stepped down in September after the FBI raided his home, followed a few weeks later by Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, who also was targeted by the feds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;abruptly resigned&lt;/a&gt; in late December after The Post exposed his subordinate Lt. Quathisha Epps’ bombshell accusations that he routinely preyed upon her, demanding sexual favors in exchange for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;eye-watering amounts of overtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sex-for-overtime accusations — which Maddrey denied — appeared to have prompted newly installed NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch to clean house. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Post revealed that top cop Jeffrey Maddrey was allegedly trading overtime for sex at police headquarters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/jessica-tisch-ousts-dozens-of-nypd-bosses-in-shocking-purge/"&gt;purged dozens&lt;/a&gt; of NYPD bosses, including the top cops in the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chell has been with the NYPD since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His tenure also saw $1.5 million civil settlement after he fatally shot Brooklyn man in the back during 2008 — an act he contended was accidental, but frustrated the victim’s family as they learned the cop ascended through the NYPD’s ranks without discipline, The City &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/04/25/brooklyn-nypd-cop-killed-womans-son-no-punishment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lunatic accused of randomly shoving a Big Apple straphanger onto Manhattan subway tracks Tuesday afternoon was charged with attempted murder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;According to police, the shove was a random attack. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kamel Hawkins, 23, was also charged with assault after he allegedly pushed a complete stranger onto the tracks at the 18th Street station shortly after 1:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The terrifying ordeal, which was captured on chilling video footage obtained by The Post, showed the hooded brute roaming the edge of the platform while the victim appeared to be looking at his phone as the train pulled into the station.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without warning, the suspect pushed the man onto the tracks, with the unsuspecting straphanger disappearing under the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim was shoved into the path of a moving 1 train.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victim, an unidentified 45-year-old man, was struck by an incoming 1 train and miraculously survived the harrowing afternoon assault with just a head injury, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They rang in the New Year – five hours ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York City barflies and dancefloor divas who wanted a New Year’s Eve night on the town – and to still be in bed before midnight – came out in droves to Manhattan bars hosting parties centered around “countdowns” as early as 7 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you walk in the bar at our 7:30 p.m. ‘matinee,’ it looks like 1 a.m.,” said Jennifer Shorr, owner of the Alphabet City club Joyface — which hosted its second annual “matinee” New Year’s Eve celebration from 5 to 10 p.m. Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Early birds dance the evening away at Manhattan bar Joyface’s New Year’s Eve “matinee.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It ends up being mostly parents, like young parents,” Shorr said of the early-night celebration, which includes pizza, a champagne toast and caviar bumps for about $100. “It’s people that have babysitters at home, people that run outside and video chat with their child for a second and then come back inside.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disco-themed bar also hosts regular boogie nights from 5 to 10 p.m. on Saturdays under the banner ‘Matinee Social Club.’ Despite the early hour, Shorr contends the event – which draws crowds in their 40s to 60s on average – is in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Tuesday’s early countdown sold out online days in advance, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These people, they still want to party and rage, so they still feel like they can get ready and go out and be out in the city at night, and then they’re home at a reasonable hour, ” Shorr said. “One couple told me that ‘this was better than couples therapy.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raquel Tirado, 40, from Jersey City, NJ, was sipping a dirty martini at Joyface with her husband Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a 3-year-old, we have to put her to bed,” the mom said. “We are going to leave at 8. The babysitter needs to leave at 9.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upper West Side resident Emmy London called the party “the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are almost 40 so it’s like we want to be home early relaxing in our pjs,” London, 39, said. “When you get to your late 30s, you’re like, ‘Is it worth it [to stay out]?’ ” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A post from the city bar Cubbyhole advertises its early New Year’s Eve countdown. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Cubbyhole/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early-bird ball drops appear to have gained popularity, with the West Village bar Cubbyhole adding its own 7 p.m. countdown “for elders and the elderly at heart” to its New Year’s Eve roster this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is awesome, and I’m 40,” a patron remarked on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another person added, “I’ve been begging the world for this for years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third person wrote, “I have never felt more seen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s last-minute announcement of the bar’s early-bird soiree amassed so much support that Cubbyhole general manager Vic King Smith said the joint has found a “new annual tradition.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I thought it would be a silly thing that drew a few folks, but the flier has gotten a ton of [Instagram] engagement, and I can’t wait to see the turnout,” Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The general manager noted the bar initially created the early event in order to allow a few regulars with disabilities, who require more space and prefer earlier timing, to enjoy the festivities. The alternative time would also allow for more patrons to frequent the small West Village dive without having to stand in line in the cold weather. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Another flier posted on social media touts Cubbyhole’s early celebration on New Year’s Eve. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Cubbyhole/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smith noted a growing trend of patrons not staying out as late post-pandemic, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are certainly still building back from and seeing the effects of that era, which means we have to get creative. If there’s a community need, we try to anticipate and meet that,” Smith said. “Cubbyhole is celebrating 30 years this year, and we have survived by staying creative and responsive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shorr said, “There’s definitely a need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel like people really want it … even if it’s [those] in the 30- to 45-year-old range, they’re still pretty young,” she said. “If they’re people who used to party and now maybe their kids are like 5, now they’re ready to go.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shorr added that even some Gen Zers are joining in on the early-partying trend and that Joyface’s “oldies” night is only 30-and-up “culturally” – and “21+ legally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The early-night trend also appears to follow similar directions &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/20/parents-with-kids-are-invading-bars-and-brewing-controversy/"&gt;breweries and bars have adopted &lt;/a&gt;in recent years to accommodate drinkers and partiers toting babies and fur-babies alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It feels, at its core, very wholesome,” Shorr said of the early-bird events. “The bar stays cleaner, the bathroom stays cleaner, no one’s rude, there’s no glass that breaks – everyone’s just very respectful and nice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re holding more than their spots in line.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thousands of revelers from all over the world lined up in Times Square bright and early Tuesday, long before the New Year’s Eve ball drop will ring in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A crowd of spectators lining up on 8th Avenue for security screening at Times Square on New Year’s Eve, hours ahead of the annual ball drop celebration. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With rain in the forecast, many flocked 8th Avenue between 47th and 50th streets as early as 7 a.m. to nab a spot that could keep them dry throughout the evening showers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, there were hardly any umbrellas in sight. Many packed ponchos, while others decided to cut their losses and hunker down with only their winter coats to protect them from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valentina Gonzalez traveled from Uruguay to meet with her friends in New York for the ball drop. She’d been camped out in the line prepared to last through the night with pizza boxes and slices of cake from Carlo’s Bakery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has been our lifelong dream, to come here and celebrate the new year in New York City,” Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have plenty of food, no liquid, no water at all. We will probably take turns going to the hotel to use the toilet before we reach the check point, but then that’s it. May God be with us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearby Rockefeller Center was impassible as thousands aimed to grab seats for their long evening. Many were nearly sprinting down the sidewalks to catch up with the ever-moving line. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Val Valeri-Castro, 20, has never actually seen the ball drop in person, despite living in Queens her entire life. Her husband, originally from Arizona, finally pushed her to see it for the first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Spectators gathering at Times Square for New Year’s Eve sport the celebration’s signature Planet Fitness hats. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that I’ve lived here my whole life, I still feel like a tourist here because I’ve never done this, so it’s cool,” Valeri-Castro said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yeah sure, I’m waiting in line all day, but it’s something I’ve never experienced before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clear pattern among many revelers was to consume as little water as humanely possible to keep from having to abandon their spots and use the restroom. Some, though, were prepped with more creative means to relieve themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach Johnson, 18, and Keegan Weeks, 18, trekked from North Carolina together and made unexpected “line friends” with Ethel Crowell, a 30-year-old who they discovered lived just a few towns away from them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Well … I brought disposable underwear,” Crowell admited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Millions int he Big Apple and around the globe will watch the annual ball drop in Times Square Tuesday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our strategy: not going,” Johnson added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m making my vision board next week,” Weeks noted, eagerly looking forward to the New Year and his eventual freedom from the dreaded line. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My resolution would probably be to drink more water. But definitely not before the ball drops. We’re gonna wait for after.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scores of vendors from across the city descended on Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday ahead of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/world-news/new-years-2025-live-updates-photos-from-nyc-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Year’s Eve ball drop&lt;/a&gt;, selling merch by the minute and even revealing one of the places they get the quirky goods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My mom talked with family here, and they say, ‘Go to the factory on Flushing Avenue and Knickerbocker Avenue’ [in Brooklyn]. We bought all the stuff there,” said a 15-year-old boy who only gave his first name, Bladimir, as he ran a stand filled with New Year’s hats, glasses and balloons on the corner of 50th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan with his mom, Maria, 39.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair of migrants said they came from Ecuador earlier this year and have been selling mango slices in Central Park since their arrival — but decided they would be going for the big money Tuesday, peddling hats for $10 and glasses for $5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A store employee arranges 2025 merchandise at a Times Square shop on New Year’s Eve. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We started one hour ago — we sold 51 hats and 62 pairs of glasses,” the teen said. “It’s a good spot. It is going to be [a] very long day today, so we started a little later. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“We were on the train around 10 a.m. from Brooklyn,” he added. “The spots filled up very, very quick. Later we will move closer [to Times Square].”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An Ecuadorian teen, Bladimir, and his mom, Maria, switched from peddling mangoes in Central Park to hawking New Year’s gear. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin Sheehan/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dwayne Hibbert, 60, a chef who originally hails from Jamaica and has lived in New York City for the past 30 years, was hawking hats, glasses and noisemakers on the corner of 48th Street and Sixth Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This entrance is the best,” he remarked, noting his location is near the subway line for the Times Square ball drop crowd. “We came early. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t our first time, but the people from Brooklyn, the people from Queens, the people from the Bronx — they show up a little later, and the spots are taken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Spectators gather ahead of the New Year’s Eve ball drop in Manhattan on Tuesday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan resident noted he embarks on the side hustle for extra cash during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everybody needs extra dough now,” he said. “We also sell these earmuffs because at night when it gets cold, people start looking for anything to warm up. Last night, we did OK — [but] tonight, we’ll do a lot better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guatemalan tourists Telma Saravia and Jose Corado were some of the vendors’ patrons, purchasing two New Year’s hats for $10 each near Radio City Music Hall. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I picked the one with no year so I can use it again next year,” Saravia said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vietnam veteran Walter Wells peddles  2025 New Year’s Eve merch. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We bought these so that we could remember our visit here to New York. We came to see the show, the Rockettes. We are just staying here for one night,” the tourist said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple said they were unsure about whether they’d be able to make it to see the ball drop — not because of the whopping crowds already gathered in Times Square but the skies, which were threatening to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/heavy-rain-expected-to-soak-times-square-for-new-years-ball-drop/"&gt;drop heavy rain on an estimated 1 million attendees. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the weather is good, we will see the ball drop tonight,” Saravia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-profile random attacks — notably the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;horrific arson &lt;/a&gt;in which a woman was burned to death on an F train — “overshadowed” New York City’s supposed successes in reining in subway crime during 2024, Mayor Eric Adams contended Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams, during a defiant end-of-year news conference, repeated his years-long mantra that the “perception” of out-of-control subway crime must be curtailed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are doing the job on bringing down the numbers, but as I say over and over and I said in 2022, New Yorkers must feel safe,” he told reporters from City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are seeing and feeling what they’re reading. So, our success is overshadowed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Eric Adams argued Tuesday that the city’s successes on reining in subway violence were “overshadowed” by random attacks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly installed NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch will send more officers onto subway platforms and into trains themselves to engage straphangers, Adams said, without providing details on how many additional cops or when or where they would be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;His press conference came nearly simultaneously with an NYPD announcement that investigators &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/mystery-woman-torched-to-death-in-horrific-nyc-subway-attack-finally-identified-by-cops-sources/"&gt;identified the straphanger &lt;/a&gt;who was burned to death more than a week ago as Debrina Kawam, 57, of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawam was allegedly set aflame by illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, who faces &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/illegal-immigrant-faces-murder-rap-for-allegedly-burning-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-as-da-promises-most-serious-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first-degree murder charges&lt;/a&gt; in the sadistic attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shocking, caught-on-video spectacle of Kawam’s body consumed by fire on an F train in Coney Island — all while the accused killer fanned the flames, before calmly sitting to watch the deadly pyre — punctuated a year of concerns that the subways are returning to the unsafe bad old days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fears led to the red-bereted Guardian Angels and the crusaders’ flamboyant founder Curtis Sliwa returning for the first time in years to patrol the subways, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/inside-the-guardian-angels-new-mission-to-take-back-subways-as-new-yorkers-ready-to-fight-back-against-transit-chaos/"&gt;straphangers greeted&lt;/a&gt; them like old friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Dec. 22 arson attack left a straphanger dead and capped a year of subway fears.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Guardian Angels returned to patrol the subways this week. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams warned Sliwa, his Republican opponent in the 2021 mayoral election, to not “overstep.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mayor maintained the subway system only has six reported crimes a day, but a deeper look at NYPD crime statistics shows violent crime, including murder, has been rising on the rails. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The arson slaying tipped subway murders to 10 this year — double the number of murders in 2023 and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/weekend-violence-including-a-sleeping-woman-burned-to-death-on-brooklyn-train-propels-nyc-subway-murder-tally-to-25-year-high-cops/"&gt;matching a 25-year high&lt;/a&gt; reached in 2022, data shows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other attacks were also at high levels — a fact punctuated by a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/us-news/straphanger-in-critical-condition-after-being-shoved-onto-nyc-subway-tracks-in-latest-transit-chaos/"&gt;straphanger being pushed&lt;/a&gt; in front of a 1 train in Manhattan shortly after Adams’ press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Adams insisted the subways are safe, he also brushed off his scandal-plagued year that saw many of his top embattled pals pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most recent ouster was NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, who resigned amid explosive accusations that he demanded sexual favors from a subordinate in exchange for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;massive amounts of overtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey’s resignation was the latest in a spate of high-level departures from Adams’ administration. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams side-stepped a question about whether he, as mayor, bore responsibility for appointing allegedly problematic officials such as Maddrey. He instead contended the buck stopped with whether his officials deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s my responsibility to make sure that the people are employed to the city deliver for the people of New York, and I take that responsibility,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mayor also argued every Big Apple administration has had their fair share of disgraced officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Life is hard,” he said when pressed by The Post, later telling reporters he had “no regrets” from 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Big Apple straphanger is in critical condition after he was shoved onto Manhattan subway tracks and struck by an incoming 1 train in what cops are calling a random attack.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A straphanger is in critical condition after being shoved onto the subway tracks.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim was shoved into the path of a moving 1 train.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The attack occurred around 1:30 pm.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suspect was described as wearing a dark hoodie and gray jeans. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified victim was at the 18th Street station shortly after 1:30 p.m. Tuesday when the hooded thug pushed him onto the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Cops responded to a 911 call and the victim was rushed to a local hospital, where he is in critical condition but stable, the NYPD said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It does not appear the two men knew each other, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dramatic video footage from the scene shows firefighters working to pull the injured man from between subway cars as bystanders gawk at the scene on the station platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The suspect, described as a man with a light complexion wearing a mask, a black jacket over a dark hooded sweatshirt and gray jeans, fled the station in an unknown direction and is still on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident is the latest in a series of transit attacks in the Big Apple, including two slashings on Sunday and the horrific Dec. 22 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;torching death of a sleeping straphanger on an F train in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfie-obsessed tourists have&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/nyc-neighborhood-is-the-first-with-turkey-crossing-signs-as-residents-hope-to-protect-rare-wild-bird-rosie/"&gt; taken over the Roosevelt Island&lt;/a&gt; tram — creating a massive headache for locals who are being forced to wait in lines stacked with as many as 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tram between Manhattan and the smaller iconic island has long been a tourist destination, but it took off in popularity this summer when it was blasted on various “top attractions in New York City” lists and across social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A long line wraps around Tramway Plaza in Manhattan on Monday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is insane. … In all my time on the Island, I have never seen something like this,” said a Roosevelt resident named Ashley, who declined to give her last name, to The Post on Sunday morning — as several hundred people were lined up&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/us-news/red-bus-chaos-on-nycs-roosevelt-island-locals-decry-the-bus-services-summer-struggles/"&gt; at Tramway Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan waiting to board the tram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived on Roosevelt Island for a little over eight years, and I’m disgusted every time I get off the tram, knowing I have to wait in that ridiculous line to get back,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-run &lt;a href="https://www.nyctourism.com/new-york/manhattan/roosevelt-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYC Tourism+Conventions group encourages tourists &lt;/a&gt;to ride the skylift to witness “a unique perspective on the City,” only apparently adding to its allure. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a beautiful way to get pictures of New York,” said Amelia Singh, 29, who is visiting from Guyana, as she was waiting for a return ride back to Manhattan over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The tram can fit 109 riders and rolls through every 10 minutes during rush hour. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I saw it on TikTok and made sure it was on my list of things to do,” she said of the tram. “Also, today was perfect weather to do it.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked if she actually spent any time on Roosevelt Island, Singh responded, “Briefly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We walked around and took pictures where you can see the bridge and the water. Then we came back over.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A family visiting from Argentina, who declined to share their names, said they added the tram to their itinerary after spotting it on a “list of attractions to do in New York” and hearing about it from friends who had previously made trips to the Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were told it would be a fun way to see the New York skyline,” one of the relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourism for the tram has boomed in recent months, much to the disappointment of locals. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family tried to leave their strollers on the tram platform but were promptly told not to by the conductor — making for just one of several slowdowns Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only one tram was in operation for the busy afternoon. On at least three occasions, the crowds swarmed the car so that it was over its 109-person capacity — forcing the conductor to remove up to several people each time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform was also visibly unsafely packed, with crowds standing shoulder to shoulder and lines bleeding through emergency exits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chaos is the new normal, according to residents — who are demanding that the Roosevelt Island Operating Corp. implement a new priority boarding policy that would allow locals and workers to skip the lengthy lines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The platform was so packed Sunday that the crowds were being pushed into the emergency exits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RIOC last year rejected such a proposal, saying in a statement that it would violate state law and contracts it has made with the city and the MTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“RIOC is … tasked with operating and maintaining Roosevelt Island, yes for residents, but also for all New Yorkers and any visitors alike,” &lt;a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=392" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the statement said. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“RIOC is proud of the iconic Roosevelt Island Tram, and we are proud that it is open equally to all New Yorkers and to the millions of people who visit New York City every year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But locals have continued their crusade, launching &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/priority-boarding-for-residents-and-workers-on-the-roosevelt-island-tram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; in November that has racked up more than 2,300 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents are calling for a priority boarding line so they can skip the lengthy waits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Make a line for residents and workers and another line for tourists,” said Roosevelt resident Nathan Lewis, 37. “That way everybody is happy. The people trying to just go home and get home peacefully and the people that want to take pictures, can take pictures in peace,” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he himself has given up on the tram, even though he and many other islanders consider it a safer option compared to taking the F subway line back and forth to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I stopped taking the subway when I heard about the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;random pushing and stabbings.&lt;/a&gt; I looked forward to my peaceful ride on the tram. But nope, not anymore. I have to go back to taking the subway, or It would take me over an hour to go home some days,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I understand the view is nice, but then maybe residents should have a priority line,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another resident gave up on the tram Sunday after waiting in line for 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourist Amelia Singh said the tram is “a beautiful way to get pictures of New York.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to miss my appointment waiting on this line,” the woman said. “This is horrible. … They have one car running, and it’s coming every 10 to 15 minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rioc.ny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6263/Performance-Measure-Report-FY2223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to an RIOC report&lt;/a&gt;, the tram serves more than 2 million people annually — a staggering figure that locals claim has only skyrocketed further in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RIOC could not provide figures for 2024, but a spokesperson pointed out that the F train, NYC Ferry and Q102 bus using the bridge linking Manhattan with Roosevelt are available and have typically shorter wait times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tram runs every 10 minutes during rush hour but an infuriating 21 minutes at other times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The agency overseeing the tram said it would be illegal to give residents and workers priority boarding. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many seething Roosevelt Islanders have joined Lewis in switching to the subway in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in addition to safety concerns, the F train is not a very reliable mode of transportation, they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I take the F train, but there was a period where the F train didn’t work — repairs on the track,” said a longtime island resident and retired doctor, who only gave her initials, GS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to describe the increase in tourism, she said, “Horrible, horrible!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many residents have abandoned the tram and have since turned to the subway, which they say has its own issues. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived on the island for 40 years, and it was never like this,” GS said, adding that while she hopes the RIOC will implement a resident priority lane, it’s likely a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s just lately, when the corporation wants to make more money or sales — they don’t care about the residents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Toustis] don’t even come to see the island. They just cross the river and then come back. Something should happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman swore in 26 citizens as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/10/us-news/nassau-county-exec-bruce-blakeman-plans-to-deputize-private-citizens-during-emergencies/"&gt;new “special deputies” &lt;/a&gt;who will be activated to assist the county during emergencies, such as a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The provisional special deputies — many of them retired police officers, and military and emergency responders — are licensed to carry guns and receive firearms training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to thank you for stepping up to the plate and being part of our safety and security in Nassau County,”&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/24/us-news/nassau-county-executive-bruce-blakeman-swamped-with-support-for-trans-athlete-ban/"&gt; Blakeman said &lt;/a&gt;at the graduation ceremony Monday night in Mineola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The number one job of a public official is public safety, public health, and public welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics have slammed the program, which falls under the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office, as Blakeman’s private militia.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;But he brushed off the brickbats, saying the special deputies will supplement — not supplant — police and emergency responders, such as by providing coverage at power plants, hospitals, and faith-based institutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their activation will help police and emergency responders do their jobs, the county executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deputies don’t get paid unless they’re activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of the newborn baby girl left abandoned in a tote bag outside a Bronx building over the weekend now faces criminal charges, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delfina Galvez, 26, turned herself in late Monday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/nypd-releases-photo-of-mystery-person-in-scramble-to-solve-case-of-abandoned-baby-girl-stuffed-in-tote-bag/"&gt;after the NYPD released surveillance footage &lt;/a&gt;showing the suspect believed to have dumped the infant on a rain-drenched sidewalk outside a Morrisania building early Sunday, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez was charged with reckless endangerment, acting in a manner injurious to a child and abandonment of a child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Delfina Galvez allegedly abandoned her infant daughter in a tote bag in front of a Bronx apartment building, authorities said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her tiny daughter, who appears to be only a few days old, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/cops-find-newborn-girl-in-tote-bag-dumped-outside-in-nyc/"&gt;was left alone outside the building &lt;/a&gt;on Reverend James Polite Ave. near East 167th Street around 6 a.m., swaddled in blankets inside the tote bag, cops said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baby’s cries prompted someone to call 911, law enforcement sources said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cops spoke to the caller and then found the infant inside the dumped bag, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Galvez was charged with reckless endangerment, acting in a manner injurious to a child and abandonment of a child, cops said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The few days-old infant was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in stable condition. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EMS workers brought the baby to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was listed in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez surrendered several hours after the NYPD released video allegedly showing her carrying the bag as she walked slowly along the sidewalk with a hood pulled up over her head, wearing a black face mask and glasses or sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Galvez, who lives about a block from the spot where she is accused of dumping her newborn daughter, does not appear to have any prior arrests in the Big Apple, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to bundle up, Big Apple. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/polar-vortex-headed-for-united-states-will-bring-exceptionally-cold-temps-in-the-new-year-weather-models-are-screaming/"&gt;polar vortex moving across the eastern half of the United States&lt;/a&gt; is set to bring shockingly cold temps to New York City — along with a potential snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting high temperatures in the New York City area to be falling as we get into the start of 2025,” Fox Forecast Center meteorologist Christopher Tate told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By the time we get into next week, we may not be escaping the 30s,” Tate said, later adding, “It’s going to be chilly, for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A polar vortex moving across the eastern half of the country will bring shockingly low temps to New York City.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s still too early to tell exactly what the polar vortex has in store for New York City, there is potential for a storm to develop in the first half of next week.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Any storm track that changes, even just 50 miles to the north of the South, will have a significant impact on whether we get snow, ice or rain in the metro. It’s a very fine line that we have to walk to get a bona fide snowstorm here in New York City,” Tate said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current projections suggest the polar vortex will last at least through the first week of January, with temperatures evening out by the second week of the month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forecasters say there’s a potential for a snowstorm to develop during the first week of January.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Climate Prediction Center at NOAA is still forecasting a likelier chance of below-average temperatures for pretty much everybody east of the Mississippi through mid-January,” Tate said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on long-range data, January has the potential to be the coldest across the US since 2014, forecasters told The Post on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are expected to begin dropping from the Rocky Mountains to the East Coast around Thursday, but the real plunge will set in sometime between seven and 14 days from now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system will bring wind chills across the Midwest dipping below zero and temperatures down to 20 degrees below average in some places, and freezing conditions setting in as far south as the Gulf Coast and even into Florida — though it is still too early to forecast exact temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most polar vortexes are unpredictable, this upcoming system will likely push persistent cold air into the region through January, with relief finally coming in February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chilling video footage captures the moment bystanders run for their lives during a brazen shooting at a Bronx bodega Monday that wounded six — including a mom who was used as a human shield and her young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passers-by are seen dashing down White Plains Road when the shots rang out at G&amp;amp;W Grocery around 4:50 p.m., the video footage obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A local shopkeeper ended up pulling an elderly woman inside his store for safety as the suspects fled the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The video shows the suspects running down White Plains Road after the shooting at G&amp;amp;W Grocery. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police said at a Monday night briefing that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/six-shot-including-12-year-old-girl-in-bronx-as-cops-search-for-suspect-nypd/"&gt;gunmen chased two men into the bodega&lt;/a&gt; and opened fire — with the cowardly targets grabbing the 40-year-old mom and using her as a shield as shots rang out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mother was shot in the stomach, while her 12-year-old daughter was hit in the right thigh, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you can imagine, mom and daughter up against the counter, and the two intended targets come in and bump into them and turn the mother around as they are being shot at,” NYPD Chief of Department John Chell said at the briefing. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The chief called the shooting “heartless” and said cops are trying to determine a motive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other people — all men ranging in age from 18 to 21 — were also hit, suffering various injuries in the legs, arms and buttocks. The victims were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After the shots, people started running,” said a witness named Adama, who works at a local grocery down the block. “I had three customers in here, and they ran. One customer got his food, and then he ran. The other two customers, the didn’t wait. They were scared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police said the intended targets were two men who ran into the bodega and used a 40-year-old mom as a human shield.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were wounded, including a mom and her 12-year-old daughter. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you ear something like that — boom, boom — usually it’s shooting,” said Adama, 29. “I stood there. I didn’t go outside. It’s not safe.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surveillance video shows one man running from the scene, moments before two other people are seen fleeing down the block as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said the suspects remain at large while the investigation continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new lawsuit accuses former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration of stripping citizens of their  “basic liberties” and playing favorites when doling out exemptions to restrictive vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 168-page suit, filed earlier this month by a group of City Council members, questions why the 2020 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/29/george-floyd-protests-okay-amid-coronavirus-gathering-ban-de-blasio/"&gt;George Floyd protests &lt;/a&gt;were allowed to surge for months in the Big Apple, even as small businesses, religious institutions and schools were shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NYC residents were lied to about the effectiveness of the lockdown and the vaccine stopping the spread,”  the filing in Queens Supreme Court claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio and his administration are being accused of stripping NYC citizens of their “basic liberties” and playing favorites when doling out exemptions to restrictive COVID mandates during the pandemic, per court docs. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Messerschmidt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The suit notes that while hundreds of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/19/dozens-of-city-workers-file-250m-suit-seeking-to-end-vax-mandate/"&gt;city workers lost their jobs&lt;/a&gt; for not complying with vaccine mandates, Dr. Jay Varma, then the COVID czar, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/us-news/nyc-covid-adviser-brags-in-secret-recording-about-drug-fueled-sex-parties-mid-pandemic-had-to-be-sneaky/"&gt;was caught on camera earlier this year &lt;/a&gt;confessing to having drug-fueled sex parties mid-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition was filed Dec. 10 by council members Joanna Ariola (R-Queens), Kristy Marmorato (R-Bronx), Inna Vernikov (R-Brooklyn), Vickie Paladino (R-Queens), David Carr (R-Staten Island) and Robert Holden (D-Queens).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It lays out a series of seemingly contradictory decisions made by the city in the months after the Big Apple’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For instance, thousands of non-vaccinated emergency responders were “forced to work” without being properly informed about the virus or given the proper protective gear as protests over the police-involved death of Floyd surged in May and June 2020, the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But months later, when vaccines became available, many of those who refused to get the jab lost their jobs, the filing states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The respondents have never explained why the protests were permitted to go forward, but everything else used in daily living was shut down,” the suit argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suit points to the hypocrisy of Dr. Jay Varma, the man behind New York City’s draconian COVID response, who by his own admission secretly broke the rules to take part in drug-fueled sex parties.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the mandates began to ease in August, indoor dining was permitted, museums, bowling alleys and other cultural institutes were reopened — but schools remained closed, the lawsuit notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teachers who refused to get a vaccine were suspended without pay and in some cases fired, the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was no data of any kind to suggest that the Former Mayor’s closing of public schools was based on any scientific evidence. The evidence suggests that the school closures were driven by the needs of the teacher’s union leadership, not the safety of the children,” the suit claims. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It also holds the ex-mayor’s administration responsible for ongoing poor mental health and dipping test scores among public school students who were forced into homeschooling at the time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also holds the policies backed by the de Blasio administration responsible for ongoing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/27/amid-the-pandemic-exodus-from-americas-public-schools/"&gt;poor mental health and dipping test scores&lt;/a&gt; among public school students who were forced into homeschooling during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit notes the alleged “preferential treatment of certain employees and supervisors” such as Varma and police officer Kimberly Lucas, who in May pleaded guilty to submitting a fraudulent vaccine card.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucas lost vacation days and was put on a one-year dismissal probation while “thousands of city workers were fired without due process for rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine and being honest about not receiving it,” the suit states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then-NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/07/01/covid-vaccine-lie-edward-caban-nypd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; he mitigated the penalty for Lucas because of her “nine years of exemplary service as a police officer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The de Blasio administration is being questioned about why it allowed George Floyd protests to surge for months, while small businesses and religious institutions were shuttered.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It appears that these working-class New Yorkers were only fired because they were not wealthy, politically connected, or refused to submit fraudulent vaccine cards,” the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attorney Jimmy Wagner, who filed the suit on behalf of the six city lawmakers, said the petition does not seek monetary damages, but rather, the plaintiffs aim to get answers from the former administration “in writing” about the pandemic-era mandates to “protect New Yorkers from suffering a similar fate in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happened during the pandemic in New York City was executive tyrannical authority,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not how our system is supposed to operate. They outcasted anyone who dared question the mandate,” Wagner charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hearing in the case has been set for early February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city Law Department, which is repping all defendants except Lucas, did not immediately comment. It’s not clear who is representing Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops have identified the woman who was lit on fire as she slept and then burned to death on a Brooklyn subway train while terrified straphangers watched in horror, law-enforcement sources said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman — who sources said was originally from New Jersey — was sleeping on an F train at the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22 when she was set on fire — with illegal Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil now facing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/illegal-immigrant-faces-murder-rap-for-allegedly-burning-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-as-da-promises-most-serious-consequences/"&gt;first-degree murder charges&lt;/a&gt; in the sick attack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Horrifying video footage shows the accused killer fanning the flames as the woman burned — and calmly watching the scorched victim from a bench on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The victim of the horrifying Dec. 22 subway arson attack was so badly burned that she initially remained unidentified. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Coalition for the Homeless &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;described her as homeless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of the woman — who was finally ID’d through fingerprints — is being publicly withheld pending family notification, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A source told The Post she was alive when she was set on fire, with a walker and several bags nearby. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/woman-torched-to-death-on-mta-train-allegedly-by-illegal-migrant-still-cannot-be-idd-three-days-after-horrifying-attack-due-to-severe-burns-sources/"&gt;medical examiner struggled to identify&lt;/a&gt; the body because it was so severely burned in the attack, relying largely on dental records when it became impossible to pull fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guatemalan immigrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, allegedly watched the woman burn after the Dec. 22 attack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;According to police Sebastian Zapeta-Calil left the Brooklyn station but was nabbed by NYPD cops in Manhattan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zapeta-Calil, who was arraigned on first- and second-degree murder and arson charges, is being held at Rikers Island without bail pending. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration officials said he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/nyc-subway-burn-suspect-is-illegal-migrant-from-guatemala-who-sneaked-into-us-after-being-deported/"&gt;entered the US illegally in 2018&lt;/a&gt; but was deported less than a week later — only to find his way back into the country and to the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By March 2023, he was living in the New York City shelter system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is charged with first-degree murder in the sick Brooklyn subway arson attack on Dec. 22. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pal at the Brooklyn facility where he last shacked up told The Post the migrant was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/sebastian-zapeta-calil-charged-in-womans-burning-death-on-nyc-subway-often-bugged-out-after-smoking-k2-shelter-roommate/"&gt;addicted to smoking the synthetic drug K2&lt;/a&gt; and drank heavily on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accused killer allegedly told cops he was so high he didn’t remember lighting the fire. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He smoked K2, drank and bugged out,” said shelter resident Raymond Robinson, who slept in a cot at the facility next to Zapeta-Calil until his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but never harmed nobody but himself,” Robinson said. “That’s why this s–t f–ked my head up because I slept next to him and he was never like that. I wouldn’t leave my daughter with anybody but he was the type of dude I could trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As long as he wasn’t high,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robinson said Zapeta-Calil liked to drink Voda vodka, “the cheapest s–t there is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to start your year off on a high note.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Legalized marijuana means New York’s 267 licensed dispensaries are offering strange new holiday gifts for the stoner who has it all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if shoppers missed the chance to stuff Christmas stockings with a stash, there’s still a chance to make it a high Hanukkah with products like THC-infused olive oil and Kosher pot gummies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Frankincense and myrrh? Great for the wise men. For everyone else, there’s cannabis,” said Melany Dobson, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/bargain-buzz-ny-pot-farm-moves-100000-economical-dime-bags-under-legalization/"&gt;upstate weed grower &lt;/a&gt;and cultivator Hudson Cannabis Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hudson Sour — available in “dime,” $9 and $10 bags, one-eighth of an ounce or 3.5 grams — packs a wallop with 34% THC.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes the best presents aren’t just things — they’re a chance to open your loved one’s eyes to how much better life can feel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Cannabis is marketing a popular marijuana strain — &lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/"&gt;Sour &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://strainstarsny.com/products/the-hudson-sour-dime-for-sale-farmingdale-ny/"&gt;iesel &lt;/a&gt;— at as many as 175 retail and delivery shops across the state. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Sour — available in “dime,” $9 and $10 bags, one-eighth of an ounce or 3.5 grams — packs a wallop with 34% THC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From pot farm to table&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lisa Barone and Mike Nelson, chefs-turned-farmers at the Herbal Confectionery in New Paltz, are selling &lt;a href="https://menus.dispenseapp.com/8d52fec99a0f1d97/menu/categories/a90e815c263e3128" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cannabis-infused oils &lt;/a&gt;to elevate your holiday meals to a new high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The line of 240 milligram products include Rosemary Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Sage Sunflower Oil and Lemongrass Coconut Oil, and go for $45 at the Weedery in downtown New Paltz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn-based &lt;a href="https://chefforhigher.com/cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chef for Higher &lt;/a&gt;also offers cannabis-infused honey as well as extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis-infused honey is selling extremely well,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/pot-home-delivery-firm-taps-stoners-to-rate-weed/"&gt;said Osbert Orduna&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of The Cannabis Place on Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village, &lt;a href="https://thecannabisplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;which carries&lt;/a&gt; Chef for Higher products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Herbal Confectionery in New Paltz, is selling cannabis-infused oils to elevate your holiday meals to a new high.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Orduna said a weed-infused brownie bake mix is also popular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cannabis Place also offers gift certificates of $25, $50, $75 and $100 and is a Toys for Tots site — so customers can drop off gifts for needy kids while indulging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pre-rolled: ‘The new wine’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also the 10-pack, half-gram &lt;a href="https://jennyloves.me/petits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pre-rolled joints &lt;/a&gt;— Petit J’s — manufactured by cultivator Jenny’s and sold for about $50 at 16 licensed weed shops in New York City and others across the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the right price. The pre-rolls are doing really well,” said owner Jenny Argie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger adults are gravitating to cannabis products more than booze, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is the new wine, the new whisky. Young people are looking for an alternative to alcohol,” Argie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Something to chew on&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jenny’s also offers a whole line of Kosher, vegan and zero glycemic or sugar-free edible cannabis products such as Go-Go and Zee-Zee gummies and chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These edibles are great for Hanukkah,” Argie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lowell Smokes offers pre-rolled weed now available in many New York retail dispensaries. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daniel Wood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also pot available from California for those who pine for West Coast weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those struggling through another New York winter, they can dream of Pacific beaches with Lowell Smokes, which offers &lt;a href="https://happydaysli.com/shop/farmingdale/lowell%20farms/the-mind-safari-hybrid-6g-prerolls-6pk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pre-rolled weed&lt;/a&gt; now available in many New York retail dispensaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fighting pain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson Cannabis sells Rick Simpson Oil aimed at fighting pain or inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The one-gram “Farmers Blend” oil includes three different weed strains and is sold in a sleek dispenser, containing 35 milligrams of THC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One dose per click can be consumed orally, topically on the skin, or by adding to a joint or smoking device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thetravelagency.co/products/hudson-cannabis-farmers-blend-rso-dispenser-for-sale-new-york-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Retail price is &lt;/a&gt;$88 online at the Travel Agency, which has stores in Greenwich Village, Midtown and downtown Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Get this oil for someone on the first night of Chanukah and we guarantee it’ll last all 8 days, and beyond,” Hudson Co. boasts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another cannabis manufacturer, 1906, is &lt;a href="https://1906.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;selling gummies&lt;/a&gt; for people seeking fast-acting pain relief — called sour watermelon-flavored Pain AM and plum-flavored Pain PM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just showing up at a pot shop can get customers into the Christmas spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoo’s that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A snowy owl was spotted swooping into Shirley Chisholm State Park over the holiday weekend — marking its first appearance in the Big Apple in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rare sighting drove hordes of curious photographers, birders and wildlife enthusiasts — hoping for a glimpse of the majestic yellow-eyed bird — to the Fountain Avenue side of the Brooklyn nature preserve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A snowy owl was spotted swooping into Shirley Chisholm State Park. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Caren Jahre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the most beautiful and distinct owls in the world,” &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/08/us-news/wild-turkey-spotted-strutting-around-manhattan-after-epic-journey/"&gt;David Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, a birder and founder of &lt;a href="https://x.com/BirdCentralPark?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Manhattan Bird Alert&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post. “It’s the owl from Harry Potter — Hedwig. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a rarity. It’s a rare sighting in New York City, generally one we only get in the middle of winter.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The mostly polar white owl — hence the winter weather moniker — was first seen late Saturday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barrett said the last substantial sighting came in 2022, noting this year’s visit is part of a snowy owl irruption — an unpredictable migration pattern resulting from a successful breeding season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a snowy owl was also spotted &lt;a href="https://x.com/BayRidgeAlerts/status/1866600704812408862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;on a floating barge in Bay Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. But by the time reports of the sighting surfaced, the bird had flown the coop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That also is the last time we know of a ‘chaseable’ report in Brooklyn prior to today,” Barrett said. “After two years with nearly no Snowy Owl irruption in the New York City and Long Island area. … Long Island’s south shore already has had multiple reports of Snowy Owls this season.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This year’s visit is part of a snowy owl irruption — an unpredictable migration pattern resulting from a successful breeding season.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of David Barrett&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the Brooklyn park was crawling with binocular-laden birders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s an otherworldly experience,” Edmund Berry, 40, told The Post after making the trek from Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berry, who has photographed hundreds of different birds across North America — including a number of snowy owls — likened the New York City sighting to a transcendent moment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s remarkable to see something that so clearly comes from the Arctic,” he said. “Seeing one in person is just a jaw-dropping experience every time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barrett noted that the owl — likely a first-year bird that was hatched this summer — had probably flown more than 1,000 miles before landing in the Five Boroughs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The rare sighting drove hordes of curious photographers, birders and wildlife enthusiasts to the Fountain Avenue side of the Brooklyn nature preserve. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Gus Keri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate the entire population is less than 30,000 in North America — and only a fraction of those migrate a long distance in a given year — making the owl’s cameo all the more unusual.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shirley Chisholm State Park is an excellent habitat for a Snowy Owl — relatively flat and not densely forested, with plenty of rats,” he added. “Snowy owls have no problem transitioning their hunting from the much smaller lemmings of the Arctic tundra to heftier New York City rats!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birder Gus Keri ventured out to the park around 8 a.m. Sunday where, amidst the fog, he found the owl perched near a path. He compared laying eyes on it to a “spiritual experience.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The moment I saw my first snowy owl, I fell in love with this species,” Keri said. “And I became obsessed when I heard about one, especially if it was in Brooklyn. I immediately wanted to share my happiness with everyone. It was an amazing experience.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A wildlife photographer noted that the owl — likely a first-year bird that hatched this summer — had probably flown more than 1,000 miles before landing in the Five Boroughs.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Edmund Berry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At approximately 2:30 p.m. Sunday, however, the snowy owl — perhaps feeling the weight of wandering eyes — abruptly abandoned its perch atop the park.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Birders observed the owl taking flight over the Atlantic Ocean before settling on an undisclosed island in the bay. And it &lt;a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S207200884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;was still partially viewable&lt;/a&gt; on the small landmass Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a possibility it could remain in the Big Apple for the winter. And possible sightings of other snowy owls could occur through March, when they make their enduring journey back to the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They come back — birds can fly, so you never know what you’re going to get,” Berry added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Connecticut man facing multiple charges in the deaths of a mother and her infant son allegedly killed them over money the woman owed him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New details were released about the November arrest of Lance “Macho” Morales, 23, following his first appearance in a Hartford, Connecticut, courtroom on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales is accused of killing 20-year-old Jessiah Mercado and her 4-month-old son Messiah Diaz in a drive-by shooting on Nov. 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An arrest warrant alleged Morales opened fire on the car the two were in because Mercado owed him $400 for using his Mazda SUV, The Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was charging her $100 a day to rent the vehicle, and she reportedly fell behind on the payments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the deadly shooting in broad daylight, an exchange took place between Morales and Mercado, in which she told him her infant son was inside the SUV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New details were released about the November arrest of Lance “Macho” Morales, 23, following his first appearance in Hartford, Connecticut.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Morales is accused of killing 20-year-old Jessiah Mercado and her 4-month-old son Messiah Diaz in a drive-by shooting on Nov. 19. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Carmon Community Funeral Homes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A witness told police that Morales said he didn’t care, The AP reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two other people were inside the car during the brazen crime, but only one of them was wounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales’ firearm was believed to be fully automatic, according to the arrest warrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An arrest warrant alleged Morales opened fire on the car the two were in because Mercado owed him $400 for using his Mazda SUV. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A massive four-day manhunt took place for Morales following the deadly shooting, and he was ultimately arrested in Puerto Rico on Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was extradited to Connecticut on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morales is charged with two counts of murder, assault and other crimes, and is facing life in prison without parole if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was ordered to be held on $5 million bail during Monday’s court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former president becoming the first in US history to be convicted of felony crimes, a mayor charged with taking bribes and an alleged assassin with legions of twisted fans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They and other high-profile figures took center stage during a dizzying and dramatic year in New York’s courts — as The Post was there to chronicle every gripping moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are just seven of the most dramatic scenes to unfold in city courthouses in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. Ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani erupts in court where he was once lionized&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudy Giuliani shot to fame as a crusading US Attorney in Manhattan federal court, where he pioneered aggressive mob prosecutions in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Giuliani erupted after the judge questioned why he hadn’t turned over the title to a car he owes Georgia election workers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;But the former New York City mayor &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/rudy-giuliani-erupts-at-nyc-federal-judge-as-january-trial-date-set-in-148m-defamation-case/"&gt;in November blew an epic fuse &lt;/a&gt;in the very same district, after a federal judge brought up his legendary past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Giuliani, 80, erupted as District Judge Lewis Liman grilled him over why he had not turned over the title &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/rudy-giuliani-shows-up-to-trump-polling-site-in-vintage-mercedes-hes-been-ordered-to-surrender-to-election-workers-he-defamed/"&gt;to his 1980 Mercedes convertible&lt;/a&gt; to two Georgia election workers he’s been found liable of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/rudy-giuliani-still-defaming-election-workers-even-after-he-was-ordered-to-pay-148m-judgment-lawyers/"&gt;defaming after the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your client is a competent person. He was the US Attorney in this district,” Liman said, addressing Giuliani’s lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The notion that he can’t apply for a title certificate,” he continued — before Giuliani cut him off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The tirade came in the same Manhattan federal court district where Giuliani was once the US Attorney. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I did apply for it!” Giuliani pleaded. “What am I supposed to do, make it up myself?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every implication that you’ve made is against me!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A trial over whether Giuliani will be forced to give up his Florida apartment and Yankees World Series rings to the Georgia election workers is set for Jan. 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Disgraced NJ Sen. Bob Menendez blames his wife for gold bar bribes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez’s bribery trial revealed a lot about the disgraced Democrat — including &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/10/us-news/sen-bob-menendez-allegedly-bragged-to-nj-businessman-who-bought-wife-mercedes-i-saved-your-ass/"&gt;his taste for swigging Cognac in his yard and dining at the Garden State’s swankiest eateries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The former senator’s lawyers blamed his wife for the gold bars found in their bedroom. Jurors didn’t buy it. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most memorable moment of the Manhattan federal court case came during opening statements, where the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/us-news/opening-statements-begin-at-sen-bob-menendez-corruption-trial/"&gt;then-senator blamed his own wife for the gold bars &lt;/a&gt;FBI agents found in their home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The veteran lawmaker’s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, claimed to jurors that the “dazzling, tall” Nadine Menendez “sidelined” her hubby and stashed away the treasure without his knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “blame-my-wife” legal strategy did not work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menendez was convicted in July of pocketing the gold bars, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a Mercedes, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/us-news/sen-bob-menendez-convicted-of-sprawling-gold-bar-bribery-scheme/"&gt;in exchange for wielding his influence to benefit three New Jersey businessmen&lt;/a&gt; and the governments of Qatar and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs hit with bombshell indictment alleging he orchestrated sick ‘freak-offs’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sean “Diddy” Combs’ indictment unsealed in September &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-charged-in-sex-trafficking-probe/"&gt;marked an epic fall from grace&lt;/a&gt; for a man once considered to be the most powerful mogul in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combs — who was ordered to cool his heels at Brooklyn’s troubled Metropolitan Detention Center until his May 2025 trial — pleaded not guilty to racketeering and sex trafficking charges at his Manhattan federal court arraignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Combs has been ordered held without bail at a Brooklyn lockup until his trial. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the feds, the über-wealthy “I’ll Be Missing You” rapper ran his label, Bad Boy Records, as a criminal enterprise, with himself as the kingpin, for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Court papers accuse him of abusing, threatening and coercing women “to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The indictment — which echoed allegations made by Combs’ ex-girlfriend &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/us-news/disturbing-diddy-abuse-allegations-first-came-to-light-in-quickly-settled-suit-with-ex-girlfriend-cassie/"&gt;Cassie Ventura in a civil suit filed a year earlier&lt;/a&gt; — describes so-called “freak-offs,” days-long sexual performances in which Combs allegedly forced his lovers to have sex with male prostitutes while he watched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Daniel Penny beats the rap in fatal subway chokehold of Jordan Neely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manhattan prosecutors admitted at the start of Daniel Penny’s trial in October that it “won’t be easy” to convict the Marine veteran of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/us-news/jury-selection-starts-in-daniel-pennys-trial-over-shocking-fatal-subway-chokehold/"&gt;“recklessly” choking mentally ill homeless man Jordan Neely to death&lt;/a&gt; on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was still stunning to see just how quickly the Long Island native went from facing up to 15 years in prison to being &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/daniel-penny-cleared-of-all-charges-in-jordan-neelys-death/"&gt;cleared of all charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Penny went bar-hopping with his lawyers, Tom Kenniff and Steven Raiser, after jurors issued the not-guilty verdict. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/daniel-penny-trial-judge-agrees-to-drop-top-manslaughter-count-after-jury-deadlocks-twice/"&gt;took the drastic step late on a Friday of moving to toss the top charge&lt;/a&gt; of manslaughter after jurors twice said they couldn’t agree on a verdict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision was made in the hope that jurors would convict on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the 12 Manhattanites quickly acquitted Penny, 26, when they resumed deliberations after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the jury forewoman read out the words “not guilty,” Penny — who had sat stone-faced for most of the four-week trial — broke out a huge smile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Marine veteran went from facing up to 15 years in prison to being cleared of all charges in just a few dramatic days. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch for the nypost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His supporters erupted in applause, prompting anger from Neely’s devastated father, Andre Zachary, who court officers ended up escorting out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It really, really hurts,” Zachary told reporters afterward. “I had enough of this. The system is rigged.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mayor Eric Adams, ex-cop who ran on fighting crime, charged with corruption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/10/the-post-says-eric-adams-should-be-nycs-next-mayor/"&gt;promised New Yorkers during his 2021 campaign that he would crack down on crime&lt;/a&gt;, which skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The feds confronted him in September, however, with alleged crimes of his own to answer for — and Adams became the first New York City mayor &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-indicted-by-grand-jury-in-historic-federal-probe-sources/"&gt;to be charged with a federal crime &lt;/a&gt;while in office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adams has pleaded not guilty, maintained his innocence, and is running for re-election in 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege he took luxury travel perk bribes from Turkish nationals — and returned the favor by pressuring officials to fast-track the opening of Manhattan’s Turkish consulate building. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s also charged with defrauding taxpayers by welcoming phony campaign donations from Turks that were “matched” by city funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams has denied criminal wrongdoing. His trial has been scheduled for May 21, 2025, smack in the middle of his re-election campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Luigi Mangione faces bizarre helipad ‘perp walk’ — and matches sweaters with lawyer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone seemingly wants a piece of Luigi Mangione, the Ivy League university graduate&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/accused-ceo-killer-luigi-mangione-may-have-been-plotting-attack-against-brian-thompson-as-far-back-as-august/"&gt; charged with executing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson &lt;/a&gt;in cold blood on a Midtown sidewalk in December.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours before the 26-year-old Maryland native was set to appear in Manhattan state court — where he’s charged with murder as an “act of terrorism” — the feds &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/luigi-mangione-hit-with-federal-charges-making-him-eligible-for-death-penalty-in-alleged-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson/"&gt;swooped in with their own case.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small army of automatic rifle-bearing NYPD officers, FBI agents — and even the mayor — paraded Mangione in front of the media as they escorted him out of a police helicopter after he was extradited to New York City from Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days after he made a brief appearance in Manhattan federal court, cops led Mangione down a state courthouse hallway for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-in-court-in-murder-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson/"&gt;yet another camera-ready perp walk &lt;/a&gt;in the district attorney’s case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accused killer strode into Manhattan Supreme Court clad in a maroon sweater over a white collared shirt, which matched the similarly layered sweater fit of his lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has pleaded not guilty. His next hearing in state court is scheduled for Feb. 21, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Donald Trump convicted in historic ‘hush money’ case after Stormy Daniels showdown&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald Trump was convicted by a Manhattan jury in May &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/us-news/donald-trump-convicted-of-illegally-fudging-business-records-in-historic-manhattan-hush-money-case/"&gt;on 34 felony counts of fudging business records&lt;/a&gt; to cover up a payoff to former porn star Stormy Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The historic verdict followed a wild, seven-week trial that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/us-news/trump-mouths-bullsh-t-during-salacious-stormy-daniels-testimony-at-hush-money-trial/"&gt;saw X-rated testimony from Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, who described an alleged brief sexual encounter with Trump as he sat fuming at the defense table in Manhattan Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jurors at the infamous “hush money” trial struggled to keep a straight face as Daniels — talking fast and gesturing wildly — described spanking Trump with a rolled-up magazine that had his face on the cover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Daniels testified that she had brief and unsatisfying sex with Trump, who sat fuming at the defense table. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The salacious quip caused Trump to reportedly turn to his lawyers and say, “That’s bulls–t,” — and drew a rebuke from the judge, who warned the ex-president about “audibly cursing” in front of jurors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But polling consistently showed that the voters did not care about the outcome of the case — which Trump ripped as a “politically motivated” bid to beat him in the courts rather than at the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trump was convicted of falsifying business records, but the verdict did not stop him from winning back the White House. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Steven Hirsch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in November, America &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/us-news/donald-trump-wins-2024-presidential-election-defying-the-odds-again/"&gt;sent a convicted felon to the White House&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump’s lawyers have urged the trial judge to throw out the conviction in light of his election, and have vowed to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year — and see you back in court in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A political war on the Hudson erupted Monday over New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the MTA’s controversial $9 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/hochul-announces-nyc-congestion-pricing-to-begin-january/"&gt;congestion toll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA can now begin collecting the first-in-the-nation congestion fee on Sunday, Jan. 5, to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street — following a federal judge’s ruling in Newark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Judge Leo Gordon said environmental mitigation concerns on the Jersey side of the Hudson have to be addressed, he chose not to issue a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the toll in his 72-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The MTA can now begin collecting the first-in-the-nation congestion fee on Sunday, Jan. 5, to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The decision does not interfere with the program’s scheduled implementation this coming Sunday, January 5,” said MTA chairman Janno Lieber.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul hailed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the best efforts of the State of New Jersey trying to thwart New York’s ability to reduce congestion on our streets while making long-overdue investments in public transit, our position has prevailed in court on nearly every issue,” she said in a Monday night statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a massive win for commuters in both New York and New Jersey. Now that the judge has issued his ruling, the program will move forward this weekend with a 40 percent reduction in the originally proposed cost of the toll,” she added, noting the originally proposed fee was $15.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the Garden State claimed the ruling does pump the brakes on the new toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the court’s ruling today in the congestion pricing lawsuit. Because of New Jersey’s litigation, the judge has ordered a remand, and the MTA therefore cannot proceed with implementing the current congestion pricing proposal on January 5, 2025,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A map detailing the new congestion-pricing zone and traffic routes.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sum, Gordon largely sided with the MTA and the US Department of Transportation — the defendants in the suit — over New Jersey, the plaintiff, regarding the extensive environmental assessments conducted over the impact of congestion pricing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the judge said the defendants erred in not providing enough specifics of measures to mitigate environmental impacts from diverted traffic in Jersey communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, congestion pricing provides specific funds for the Bronx, including $15 million to replace diesel-powered transport refrigeration units at the Hunts Point Produce Market, $20 million to fund an asthma care center and $10 million to add air filtration systems to schools near highways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hochul originally tabled a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited until after the election to push a $9 commuter tax. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No such mitigation measures — in terms of addressing pollution — are provided to New Jersey’s impacted communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge said the defendants didn’t explain why “they were able to set with precision monetary amounts dedicated to relief in New York while providing no minimum amounts for mitigation for potentially impacted areas in New Jersey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The court must conclude that the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration] and Project Sponsors acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in reaching their mitigation determination in the Final EA,” Gordon noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge gave the FHWA until Jan. 17 to take actions to comply with the ruling regarding mitigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Backers, including Hochul, said revenues from the new toll will help fund mass transit and curb traffic while opponents say it’s a cash grab for the spendthrift MTA. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul originally tabled&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/05/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-considering-delaying-congestion-pricing-report/"&gt; a $15 proposed toll &lt;/a&gt;to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited until after the election to push a $9 commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan federal judge last week also rejected a bid from plaintiffs — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/06/metro/uft-paying-costs-of-staten-island-congestion-pricing-fight/"&gt;including the United Federation of Teachers&lt;/a&gt; and Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella — to block implementation of the toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backers, including Hochul, said revenues from the new toll will help fund mass transit and curb traffic while opponents say it’s a cash grab for the spendthrift MTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one remaining anti-toll case brought by Hempstead Town Supervisor Don Clavin, pending in Brooklyn federal court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman who was murdered by a group of men in Queens more than three decades ago has finally been identified – through advanced DNA testing – as a mom who went missing soon after celebrating her daughter’s first birthday, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judy Rodriguez was 30 when her family reported her missing on January 23, 1991, a short time after her daughter Stephanie’s first birthday party. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several months later, on Aug. 25, 1991, an unidentified woman’s body was found hidden under a large wooden board – with a cord binding her ankles – in a grassy area where the Cross Island and Southern State parkways meet, according to the Queens District Attorney’s Office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An in-depth DNA analysis revealed — 33 years later — that Rodriguez was in fact the victim of the gruesome slaying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really is heartwarming to have answers,” Anna Salvadore, Rodriguez’s sister, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/queens/nyc-family-gets-answers-mystery-disappearance-dna/6086514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told NBC 4 New York&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The investigation revealed that four men approached Rodriguez sometime between July 15 and Aug. 15, and took her on a nightmarish drive where two of them tied her up, according to the DA’s office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They drove her to the drop-off spot – pushing her out of the car, where one of the brutes struck her on the head with a large metal flashlight, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blow caused her death, according to prosecutors, who said that the violent foursome then drove away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crew returned to the scene about two weeks later, and attempted to conceal the body by covering their victim with a large wooden board, the DA’s office charged. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four men – two 20-year-olds and the others ages 18 and 19 at the time of the killing – were arrested and charged in August and September of that same year, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of them pleaded guilty in September of 1992 to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25 years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was cut loose in 2009 on parole, which discharged him in August of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two others pleaded guilty in October 1992 to first-degree reckless endangerment and were sentenced to 2 1/3 to seven years in prison, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both were released in 1996 and discharged from parole in April of 1998. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final suspect pleaded guilty in February of 1993 to hindering prosecution and received a sentence of 1 ½ to 4 ½ years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was also released to parole in 1996 and ultimately discharged in July of the following year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigation was revived in November of 2023, when the Queens DA’s Cold Case Unit and the NYPD called in a private lab to help them with clues on the victim’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then in April of 2024, DNA Labs International used advanced DNA testing of the victim’s skeletal remains to produce a comprehensive genealogical profile, which was uploaded to public databases, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detective Joseph Rodriguez of the NYPD’s Investigative Genealogy Squad then used the results to build a family tree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salvadore told NBC her own daughter had submitted a DNA sample to a database and allowed law enforcement to review it – which ultimately opened the door to answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An NYPD genealogist called Salvatore, confirming “a possible DNA match to a missing person,” she told the network. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I immediately got chills when I heard the message,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A detective then asked Judy Rodriguez’s daughter Stephanie to submit samples for testing as well, the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It came back a 100% match on the anniversary of my mom’s passing,” she told NBC. “I felt like it was my mom giving us answers. It was incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family is now planning to bury Judy near her near her parents and hold a proper memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Honestly happy that we are able to put her to rest. And that we were able to find her,” Stephanie Rodriguez told the network. “It’s bittersweet but I’m so grateful we have answers. So grateful, beyond blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz commended all of the agencies involved for finally bringing closure to the grieving family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Three decades ago, four men were convicted for a gruesome killing of an unidentified woman,” Katz said in a statement. “Though justice was served, the family went 33 long years without any answers about their loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to our partners at the NYPD and the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, we have now provided those crucial details, which I hope brings a measure of solace,” she added. “This case is a prime example of the determination of my Cold Case Unit in identifying victims and solving the borough’s oldest, most challenging homicides.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rep. Grace Meng, who secured a $500,000 grant for the DA’s office to investigate cold cases, also applauded the long-awaited break in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This latest case from 1991 underscores why this money is so important, and it’s an example of the types of cases it will be used to solve,” Meng said. “I’m proud to work with District Attorney Katz in pursuing justice for the victims of cold cases in Queens, and I continue to stand with her in never forgetting about them and their loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops are searching for a man who shot six people, including a 12-year-old girl, in the Bronx on Monday afternoon, sending all of them to the hospital.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened around 4:50 p.m. at 3544 White Plains Road — roughly a block from Marcus Garvey Square in Olinville, according to the NYPD. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were shot in the Bronx on Monday afternoon, police said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Citizen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what sparked the gunfire, but cops said they found three men, two women and the young girl with bullet wounds when they arrived. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise ages of the other victims is currently unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The wounded were brought to area hospitals, where they are in stable condition, cops said. The 12 year-old’s injuries are not serious, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, police are searching for the suspect, who fled wearing all black except for a blue surgical mask covering his face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a New Year’s ball drop we’d all like to soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The estimated 1 million revelers set to ring in 2025 in the Big Apple are in for a very soggy time in Times Square, with rain expected to soak the city all night on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, rain is expected to move into the New York City area around 7 p.m. and likely linger through midnight,” Fox Forecast Center Meteorologist Stephanie van Oppen told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a chance of some very heavy rain between 10 and 11 p.m. that will be potentially disruptive for anyone outside trying to see the ball drop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy downpours have the potential to persist through 1 or 2 a.m. on New Year’s Day, creating possible snarls for New Yorkers heading home from their New Years celebrations. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The weather is expected to clear up by Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are expected to stay mild, in the 40s and 50s, through the New Year’s festivities, according to van Oppen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wet weather will soak much of the East Coast for the holiday, thanks to a storm system that is moving into the Interstate 95 corridor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Temperatures will likely cool off moving into Wednesday, and the storm system could even produce snow in areas like Buffalo and Watertown, van Oppen said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers, however, will likely have to wait longer for their first snowfall of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims of notorious Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/metro/madoff-victims-paid-another-158m-by-compensation-fund-feds/"&gt;receiving their final payments&lt;/a&gt; — bringing the total amount doled out by a compensation fund to over $4.3 billion, the feds announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Madoff Victim Fund began distributing its 10th and last payment of $131.4 million to more than 23,000 victims worldwide, according to the Manhattan US Attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice set up the fund over a decade ago to repay people swindled by Madoff — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/14/bernie-madoff-infamous-ponzi-schemer-dead-at-82/"&gt;who died behind bars&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 while serving out a 150-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Victims of Bernie Madoff’s global Ponzi scheme have been paid by a compensation fund $131 million, in the funds final payment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, 40,930 of Madoff’s victims from 127 counties have recouped over $4.3 billion in compensation — or 93.71% of their losses, the feds said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff’s massive ripoff — believed to be the biggest stock fraud in history — came to light roughly 16 years ago during the financial crisis of the late 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The reviled scammer &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2009/03/13/madoff-bares-his-65-billion-lie/"&gt;pleaded guilty to 11 financial crimes&lt;/a&gt; — including fraud, money-laundering and perjury — in 2009 for swindling investors, friends and family through the crooked wealth management company he founded in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting around the 1990s, the fraudster collected money from others through his company Bernie L. Madoff Investment Securities with the promise he’d invest it — but then he never did, he admitted at his sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and died while he was serving his prison sentence in 2021. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His victims included charities and retirees who entrusted their life savings to him, as well as New York University, the International Olympic Committee and notable figures like former Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katsenberg, legendary Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and Hollywood couple Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff’s fraud has been tied to at least four suicides, including his elder son Mark’s, who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/15/what-happened-to-bernie-madoffs-family-after-ponzi-scheme/"&gt;hanged himself&lt;/a&gt; on Dec. 11, 2010 — the two-year anniversary of his dad’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His younger son Andrew also blamed Madoff for the recurrence of the rare cancer, mantle-cell lymphoma, that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2014/09/03/bernie-madoffs-son-andrew-dead-at-48-after-cancer-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed him in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Madoff was sentenced to 150 years behind bars for carrying out the world’s largest fraud.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff was sentenced in June 2009 to a century-and-a-half behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and his co-conspirators, including brother Peter Madoff, were forced to fork over the ill-gotten gains as part of the prosecution by the Manhattan US attorney’s office — funds used to pay back victims, the feds said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, about $2.2 billion of the victim compensation funds were collected from the estate of a deceased Madoff investor, Jeffry Picower, and another $1.7 billion came as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This Office has never stopped pursuing justice for victims of history’s largest Ponzi scheme,” said Acting Manhattan US Attorney Edward Kim in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOJ “is committed to protecting and assisting victims of crime, no matter how long it takes and no matter how complicated the endeavor,” Kim added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff in 2020 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/05/bernie-madoff-has-less-than-18-months-to-live-seeks-release-from-prison/"&gt;asked for compassionate release&lt;/a&gt; from prison, claiming he only had months to live because he had kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his bid to be freed was denied after some 500 victims&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/05/bernie-madoff-should-die-behind-bars-prosecutors/"&gt; wrote letters to a judge&lt;/a&gt; saying Madoff should die behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also asked Trump in 2019 to reduce his prison term, but the request went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madoff &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/01/bernie-madoff-died-of-kidney-disease-hypertension-according-to-death-certificate/"&gt;died at 82 of kidney disease and hypertension&lt;/a&gt; on April 14, 2021 at a federal lockup in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New NYPD video shows the mysterious masked person who authorities believe&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/cops-find-newborn-girl-in-tote-bag-dumped-outside-in-nyc/"&gt; abandoned a newborn baby girl &lt;/a&gt;stuffed inside a tote bag in front of a Bronx apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The footage, released early Monday, shows the unidentified person walking on the rain-drenched Morrisania sidewalk Sunday morning with a hood pulled up over his or her head, wearing a black face mask and carrying a green tote bag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infant, who appears to be only a few days old&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and was swaddled in blankets inside the tote bag — was dumped outside a building on Reverend James Polite Ave. near East 167th Street around 6 a.m., cops said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baby’s cries prompted someone to call 911, law enforcement sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMS workers brought the baby to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was listed in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police were still trying Monday to track down the mystery bag carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two randy city subway workers went off the rails while on the clock, repeatedly cozying up in a car — and tipping off officials to their illicit deeds by keeping the windshield shade on while it was pitch-black out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the MTA employees — a supervising Romeo whose duties included inspecting tracks — copped to romping with his subordinate female “flagger” two to three times a week for about a year, according to a report by the MTA inspector general Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When asked if they were intimate while parked in their personal vehicles, she said they were physically&lt;br&gt;close and touched,” the agency said without identifying the pair.&lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Investigators conducted surveillance and found the duo outside MTA worksites in a car together on five separate occasions during their work shifts. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The duo worked the overnight shift at the DeKalb station in Brooklyn, where the supervisor regularly “assigned the Trackworker to flag for him”  and she provided “flagging protection for his nightly&lt;br&gt;assignments on the roadbed,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up on an anonymous tip, investigators conducted surveillance and found the duo outside MTA worksites in a car together on five separate occasions during their work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The [maintenance supervisor] and the Trackworker were observed together in a parked car registered to the Trackworker, on a quiet and secluded street, with a sunshade up in the front windshield (despite it being nighttime), for approximately three hours on one occasion and approximately one hour on the other,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, the pair took one of their cars to a laundromat and spent about an hour and 20 minutes there, the probers found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After being confronted, the supervisor admitted the track worker had been “one of[his] best friends” since 2013, when they were both assigned to the Grand Central Terminal field office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said they had socialized together outside of work and “at one point had a romantic relationship and were very close.” The woman confirmed they had a romance, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lovey dovey duo violated numerous ethics and transit work rules during their hook-ups, the IG’s office found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Track workers who are not on the rails are supposed to wait for the next job assignment from the Dekalb station or other work sites, not leave the premises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Workers are also supposed to take the subway to do track work, not use a private vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are also supposed to clock out when leaving the premises during work hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The probe concluded the couple received full pay despite abandoning their shifts for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“MTA supervisors are expected to lead by example, not teach their subordinates to violate the rules and go off site together while on the clock,” said MTA IG Daniel Cort in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This case should send a clear message that my office will relentlessly pursue unethical conduct and blatant mismanagement day and night,” Cort said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hot-and-heavy behavior cost the duo tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The track worker was suspended from work without pay from June until December 2024, following an arbitration hearing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The maintenance supervisor was demoted in September, without back pay following his June suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The MTA holds its workforce to the highest standard and these two employees should have known better,” said MTA rep Joana Flores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lying and misusing work time will not be tolerated and is unacceptable. Both employees were immediately removed from service without pay and faced disciplinary action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Apple straphangers are on board. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers on Monday embraced the Guardian Angels and founder Curtis Sliwa as the anti-crime crusaders &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/guardian-angels-say-theyll-start-patrolling-nyc-subway-again-after-woman-burned-to-death-on-f-train/"&gt;resumed patrols of the troubled&lt;/a&gt; city subway system for the first time since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One grateful New Yorker even planted a kiss on Sliwa as the red-beret-wearing crew poked around the darkest corners of Bronx and Manhattan stations looking for trouble — with The Post tagging along. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa says it’s time for the group to resume subway patrols for the first time since 1980. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see ya’ll back,” Bronx resident Tammy Benson, 60, told Sliwa after giving him a kiss at the 125th Street station in Harlem. “You and them need to come back. I’m grateful to see it. I feel really blessed when I see [Sliwa] It’s been like 40 years and he’s really sweet and kind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need to come back!”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Another straphanger, Manhattanite Natalie Lora, told The Post the Angels were a welcome sight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need them,” said Lora, 40. “It’s that time: We need them again. We’re happy to see them. If you’re a native New Yorker then you know.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sliwa, a former Republican mayoral candidate, was flipping burgers as night manager at a Bronx McDonald’s when he founded the group in 1979 amid horrific subway violence at the time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Post tagged along Monday as the Guardian Angels launched new patrols of the city subway system.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two three-member crews of Guardian Angels engaged the homeless in the subways, handing out water and checking on their conditions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once topping off with thousands of members worldwide, the Guardian Angels have since returned to the underground several times — but not since the last patrols nearly 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This weekend Sliwa announced that he was taking his volunteers back into the transit system following the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;horrifying arson death of a homeless woman&lt;/a&gt; on an F train in Brooklyn earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday cops reported &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/30/us-news/subway-stabbing-suspect-arrested-after-slashing-victim-in-the-neck-on-platform-cops/"&gt;two more transit attacks&lt;/a&gt; — a 48-year-old man slashed in the neck at the West 50th Street and Eighth Avenue station in Manhattan and a 52-year-old man stabbed in the arm at the Myrtle-Wyckoff station on the Brooklyn-Queens border. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NYPD stats show that over the past 28 days alone there were 48 felony assaults reported in the system, a jump of about 40% over the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Each three-member crew of Guardian Angels will work four-hour shifts patrolling the subways around the clock, the group said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa said the Guardian Angels will focus patrols on the F line, the same line that saw a horrific arson murder this month. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sliwa said that’s why the Angels are back on the beat in the subways. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We ride the trains and check every car and make the presence known in every car and then we get off and check the really bad stations like here at 125th and Lex,” he said. “Upstairs is like dope fiend city.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guardian Angels founding member Arnaldo Salinas said 70 people have reached out to volunteer for the subway patrols since The Post wrote about the new effort on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Salinas said applicants are carefully screened to weed out vigilantes out for blood. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“First, we do the interviews and we ask them questions like why do you want to do this, and if we get answers like ‘my mom was robbed the other day an I want to get out there and kick the f–king s–t out of somebody,’ then, no, we can’t use you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Guardian Angels organizers said 70 people have volunteered to join new subway patrols since The Post wrote about them on Sunday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re one of these Bruce Lee wannabes, I’m afraid not. We can’t use you,” Salinas added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the gig is also dangerous — six Guardian Angels have been killed on patrols since 1980, and others have suffered injuries ranging from broken bones to losing an eye from an attack with a golf club.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new patrols consist of three Guardian Angels each and will run around the clock on four-hour shifts, the group said, with the F line — site of the horrific arson attack — one of the main focuses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday two teams, including Sliwa, boarded an uptown 6 train up to Harlem, then back downtown and to the Coney Island station in Brooklyn — approaching the homeless and offering to help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one station a shoeless young woman approached Sliwa — asking if he was the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa was the night manager at a Bronx McDonald’s when he founded the Guardian Angels in 1979.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Curtis Sliwa said the group will offer the homeless advice and a helping hand as they patrol the subways.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a brief conversation a bystander stepped up and gave the woman a pair of socks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“See?” Sliwa told her. “There are good people who care about you. You can get out of this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one tense encounter, Sliwa approached a man who appeared to be selling drugs at the 125th Street station, chewing out the man until he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You better get the hell out of the subway,” he told the man. “We will get you out of the subway if you’re here to sell drugs. Get the hell out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the confrontation was largely for show, it was a welcome sight for many straphangers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You guys are needed down here,” 52-year-old Bronx resident Sonny Raimundi told Sliwa as he shook his hand Monday. “You guys are for the regular people who are working the night shifts and the late shifts and down here at night alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cops can’t cover everything,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A rep for Mayor Eric Adams said the city has clamped down on crime and described the Guardian Angels new subway patrols as “theatrics.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a rep for Mayor Eric Adams on Monday maintained that cops have put a dent in crime in the city, and suggested that the Guardian Angels’ new patrols are little more than “theatrics.” Adams defeated Sliwa in the 2021 mayoral race.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The mayor surged 1,000 police officers per day into the subways, has brought down overall crime, and transit crime, delivering real action — not theatrics — but he knows there’s still more work to be done,” City Hall press secretary Kayla Mamelak said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unlike others who only seek attention with meaningless stunts, Mayor Adams remains focused on real solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new patrols come as Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,250 National Guardsmen to patrol the city’s transit system at 150 locations including the major hubs at Grand Central, Times Square and Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Hochul declined to comment on the Angels’ patrols but said the governor is working closely with City Hall and the NYPD to “remove individuals with mental illness who pose a risk to themselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul understands there’s more work to do, and she will continue working with NYPD, State Police, MTA PD, National Guard and other law enforcement personnel to make our subways safer,” spokesman Avi Small said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tourism de force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple ushered in a whopping 64.3 million visitors in 2024 — and is on track to bounce back to pre-COVID tourism levels next year, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s comeback marked the second-highest tourist count in city history, and reflected a 3.5% increase in visitors from 2023, according to a report from the New York City Tourism + Conventions group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York remains the most visited city in the United States and a top destination for international markets and major events,” said the report, released this month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Big Apple ushered in 64.3 million tourists in 2024 – and fell just short of 2019’s record-setting 66.6 million visitors, according to a report released this month from New York City Tourism + Conventions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of travelers this year fell just short of 2019’s record-setting 66.6 million — but 2025 will bring even more sightseers to the five boroughs, the city’s official tourism organization predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;More than 67 million visitors are expected to be welcomed into the Big Apple in 2025, marking a a “full recovery” back to pre-pandemic levels, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New York City has once again solidified its position as the premier destination in the nation and one of the top travel spots in the world,” Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement, “and we’re looking forward to beating our own tourism record next year with a full recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pre-pandemic year of 2019 saw the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/bklyn-residents-fume-over-crowds-flocking-to-iconic-selfie-spot-in-trendy-nabe-its-like-times-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;highest number of tourists&lt;/a&gt; scrambling to New York City to date. It marked the city’s tenth consecutive record-breaking year for visitors, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/reports/osdc/tourism-industry-new-york-city#:~:text=New%20York%20City%20hosted%2066.6%20million%20visitors,a%2067%20percent%20reduction%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York State Comptroller’s Office. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourists lower their masks to take a selfie in Times Square in Manhattan in December 2021.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic “decimated the tourism sector, causing the number of travelers to the city to drop significantly,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/osdc/reports/nyc-sectors/tourism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state comptroller’s office&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, visitor spending dropped by nearly three-quarters, costing the city $1.2 billion in lost tax revenues in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourism dollars generated over $6.8 billion in tax revenue this year, which saved New York households an average of $2,000 each, according to the mayor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourists spent $51 billion directly, including on lodging, dining, entertainment and art and cultural attractions, the New York City Tourism + Conventions report found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those spending dollars included Broadway show tickets, with attendance expected to reach 12.5 million by the end of 2024 — up 9% from last year, but still down 8% from 2019, the tourism bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through November 2024, the city’s 700-plus hotels sold 24.1 million room nights – a 4.1% increase from last year, though still 6% under 2019’s level. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average daily cost of a room this year was $303, up 4.9% from 2023, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2024, we saw growth in both visitation and spending, reaching an estimated total direct spend of more than $51 billion across the city and state,” NYC Tourism + Conventions President and CEO Julie Coker said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tourists’ dollars generated over $6.8 billion in tax revenue in 2024, according to the mayor’s office, which saved New York households an average of $2,000 this year.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stephen Yang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This recovery supported over 388,000 leisure and hospitality jobs, and generated more than $6.8 billion in tax revenue, benefiting local businesses,” Coker added. “As we look ahead to 2025, we expect this momentum to continue, further strengthening NYC’s role in driving the state and local economy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of this year’s 51.3 million domestic visitors hailed from other cities – like Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple also saw an increase in European travelers, with about 13 million international arrivals — representing 50% of spending across the five boroughs, the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;2025 is slated to break tourism records in the Big Apple, according to New York City Tourism + Conventions. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most international travelers hailed from the U.K., with about 1.1 million visitors in 2024, followed by Canada at 1 million and France, Brazil and Italy with more than 700,000 tourists each. China followed with about 609,000 visitors, and Germany, Mexico and Australia accounted for about 500,000 visitors each, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year is also on track to be the busiest year ever for airports, the tourism group found, noting that October 2024 already marked the most bustling October of all time, with 4.3 million international passengers flowing through the New York City area’s commercial airports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite this growth, challenges remain,” the tourism report found, “including exchange rates, visa access and air travel capacity, which continue to impact business travel and long-haul international markets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, more than $20 billion is being invested across JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International airports to “improve travelers’ experiences and support continued growth,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revelers celebrating the Times Square ball drop can expect a mammoth police presence and NYPD drones in sky air amid heightened global tensions — including the persistent threat of spillover violence from the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City officials say Gotham is still on high alert after Hamas’s surprise Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the seizure of hundreds of hostages — some of whom remain in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the NYPD will be out in force during the New Year’s bash, which Mayor Eric Adams said focuses the eyes of the world on the Big Apple for just one night — and makes it the “crossroads of the entire planet.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The NYPD will be out in force on New Year’s Eve, city officials said Monday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;James Keivom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every year, thousands of people across the globe, they come here to Times Square and celebrate,” Adams said at a Monday press conference.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They see the main stage of the ball actually dropping,” he said. “What they don’t realize is how much goes on behind the scenes to ensure that people are safe.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That massive operation will involve the “full complement of our police personnel,” he said — including uniformed and plainclothes cops, horse-mounted officers, drone teams, bomb-sniffing dogs, helicopter crews and members of the NYPD’s Intelligence Bureau, Special Operations division and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, they’ll be searching for any and all threats to the gathered crowd, expected to number around 1 million people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;About a million people are expected to flock to Times Square for the celebration.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We will make sure each one of those who come here to visit and enjoy the ball drop will be safe,” Hizzoner said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch echoed Adams’ comments and said that despite no “specific, credible threats” to the New Year’s Eve celebration, the department will remain vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That includes members of some of our elite specialized units, including our emergency services unit, who will be strategically deployed throughout the area on rooftops.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the department will deploy a “tremendous amount of police resources.”  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;G.N.Miller/NYPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tisch added that the NYPD is deploying dedicated pickpocket teams to collar sneak-thieves looking to take advantage of the crammed-in crowd — and said security will be tight throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All manholes, mailboxes, vending machines and litter baskets in the frozen zone will be either sealed or removed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And frozen safety lanes will be created around the event using blocker cars and concrete barriers,” she continued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;City officials stressed the need for public vigilance during the celebration.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Giovannini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And as always, there will be plenty of security measures that you will not see. No one handles large-scale events like this better than the NYPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, both Adams and Tisch stressed the need for the public to keep its eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security is everyone’s responsibility,” Adams said. “So if you see something, say something.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police commish agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public is our eyes and ears,” Tisch said. “So if you see something suspicious, or if something doesn’t look or feel right, tell a police officer or call 911 right away.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public’s ability to see something, say something and do something makes a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young humpback whale washed ashore in Long Beach on Monday morning — with authorities now working to determine why it died, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early this morning, a juvenile humpback whale was discovered washed ashore at Roosevelt beach,” Long Beach&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1008379754664176&amp;amp;set=a.223436863158473" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; police said in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. “The City is in contact with our Federal and State partners. A necropsy will be performed later this morning followed by burial. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A young humpback whale was found dead on Long Beach Monday.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News12 Long Island Kurt Semder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Long Beach Police Department is calling on federal and state agencies to help determine what killed a &lt;a href="https://leebythesea.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;humpback whale that washed ashore Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leebythesea.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please avoid the area to allow the various agencies to conduct their work.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whale, which is an estimated 30 feet long, has already started to draw gawkers, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/KurtSemder/status/1873765929282375931"&gt;post on X by News12 Long Island&lt;/a&gt; reporter Kurt Semder. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic Marine Conservation Society said the whale is one of several who have washed up on Long Island beaches in recent weeks, including a minke whale that washed up in Oyster Bay over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1027044229462163&amp;amp;set=a.344476274385632"&gt;according to a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another humpback washed up in Napeague on Dec. 17, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1019850903514829&amp;amp;set=a.344476274385632"&gt;the group added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Authorities say the humpback whale found dead on a Long Island beach is the latest in a series of similar incidents since 2017. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;News12 Long Island Kurt Semder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Authorities are asking curious residents to stay clear of a young humpback whale that washed up dead on Long Beach. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leebythesea.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing investigation into the increased number of &lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2017-2024-minke-whale-unusual-mortality-event-along-atlantic-coast?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3bC_289KesxYax8AAKxggbgFfTksra41gJmHzUHZHoq_MInRJ2yZjtyK0_aem_SK1qKN9BNIMvjN1mH1UaWQ"&gt;minke whale deaths since 2017&lt;/a&gt;,” the society also said in a recent post on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you come across a sick, injured or deceased whale, dolphin, seal or sea turtle, it is important to report the animal to the NYS Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Hotline at (631)- 369-9829.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westchester County prosecutors have two new suspects in a controversial 1996 double murder of an upstate millionaire that spawned five trials and an overturned conviction — but no answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Westchester DA Miriam Rocah has set her sights on a pair of potential culprits who brutally killed Archie Harris, whose estate was worth in excess of $2 million at the time of his death, and his home health aide inside his Eastchester home, &lt;a href="https://www.westchesterda.net/december-2024/7129-westchester-district-attorney-miriam-e-rocah-statement-on-developments-in-investigation-into-1996-eastchester-double-murder"&gt;prosecutors announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An extensive and ongoing investigation was undertaken by my Conviction Review Unit, following a request in 2023, has identified two individuals involved in the murders of Archie Harris and Betty Ramcharan and no connection to Selwyn Davis, who was previously charged,” the DA said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Westchester DA Miriam Rocah said there are new suspects in the 1996 slaying of millionaire Archie Harris, but is passing the case on to the next prosecutor. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-86 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Archie Harris’ estate was worth $2 million at the time of his death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Harris’ home health aide Betty Ramcharan was also killed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we undergo a change in administration at the DA’s Office this week, it is my hope that these significant developments lead to continuing investigation and action so that justice can be achieved for the families of Mr. Harris and Ms. Ramcharan,” Rocah said. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The violent slayings have dogged the Westchester DA’S Office for decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days, of Mount Vernon, was arrested shortly after the bodies — and Harris’ dog — were discovered on Nov. 21, 1996, all viciously beaten and stabbed to death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators set their sights on Days, whose mother, Stella Davis, the 76-year-old millionaire’s previous health care aide, had filed a sexual abuse complaint against Harris in July 1996.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The case remained cold until April 2001, when Days was indicted on murder charges based largely on an alleged confession after an intense grilling by Eastchester detectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Days’ first trial ended in a hung jury in December 2003, the first of five trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Selwyn Days spent 16 years behind bars for the 1996 double murder before he was acquitted at his fifth trial in 2017. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of second-degree murder in April 2004 and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison — only to have the conviction overturned on Dec. 31, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days’ third trial also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2011/03/10/hung-jury-in-3rd-trial-in-1996-ny-double-killing-of-archie-harris-and-betty-ramcharan/"&gt;ended in a hung jury in March 2011&lt;/a&gt;, but a fourth trial led to a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2011/12/20/ny-man-sentenced-for-1996-double-murder-in-eastchester/"&gt;new conviction seven months later&lt;/a&gt; and another 50-years-to-life sentence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, that conviction was also tossed by a state appellate court, which led to a fifth trial in 2017 that led to his acquittal on all the charges in the controversial case. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days spent 16 years behind bars before being cleared — with the case going cold again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, prosecutors announced that there were new suspects, but provided no further details. The office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rocah did not seek re-election and incoming DA Susan Cacace is set to replace her next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kitty has quite a tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tsar the house cat disappeared from his owners during an annual family photoshoot on Governors Island in October – and miraculously managed to survive in the wild for weeks in winter temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Tsar the house cat disappeared on Governors Island in October after his owners brought him to a pumpkin-patch photo op there. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty astounding,” Governors Island overnight caretaker, Tristan Mariner, told The Post. “He clearly had some good instinct. He was in an area that had a heated bathroom cart, which we’re assuming he lived under – and that’s where we found him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mariner added that the 15-pound cat appeared well-fed and healthy when he was rescued Dec. 8 and probably hunted mice and sifted through the island’s various compost bins to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He must’ve been eating good somehow,” Mariner remarked, “but he was certainly relieved to have  a handful of sardines when I saw him.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Tsar’s saga began Oct. 27 when he and his owners attended the annual Pumpkin Point photo op festivities on the island, which is just a few hundred yards off Manhattan and Brooklyn and has no full-time residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finicky feline disappeared under bales of hay, and despite people searching the area for him for hours, the critter was nowhere to be found, Mariner told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We took our annual family photo with the pumpkins and Tsar (who’s been to the Island multiple times and enjoys roaming) decided to sit under the wagon of hay,” Tsar’s family wrote in an online lost-and-found pet forum post. “We called out to him a few hours later and he didn’t come, we waited until the last ferry (6 p.m.).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governors Island caretaker Tristan Mariner says Tsar (on his lap here) likely survived hunting mice and sifting through local compost bins. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Trust for Governors Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One week after Tsar’s escape, Mariner spotted the pet on the southern half of the island. But attempts to lure the cat with tuna and draw him out were unsuccessful, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other staff spotted the animal as well over the next few weeks, but none were able to secure him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A last-ditch attempt to use “humane” SPCA cat traps eventually proved fruitful, Mariner told The Post – with Tsar appearing in a trap Dec. 8, a whopping 42 days since he left his owner’s side at Pumpkin Point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to get this cat out of here,” Mariner acknowledged. “Of course, a lot of different people have different stakes. I’m a gardener, I really like birds, and cats aren’t good for birds. Also, there’s a poor cat out here in the cold, and of course I want to get him home.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The wayward cat was spotted on island security cameras in November. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Trust for Governors Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mariner, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said the timing of Tsar’s escape was crucial to fnding him: In the island’s slower winter months, he was able to dedicate more time to the rescue mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was the security team seeing him on the security cameras, combined with the horticulture team and gardeners seeing him in their area, it sort of narrowed down the score of where I was looking and eventually [where I] put the traps [down],” Mariner said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundskeeper said Tsar was found just a 4-minute walk from the site of the Pumpkin Point photo-op, describing the cat’s rescue as a “huge relief.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting,” Mariner said. “It worked out really well. … I immediately called my bosses, called the family to tell them. It was a big relief for everybody, they were really happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has lost his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/donald-trump-at-manhattan-federal-court-as-lawyers-seek-to-overturn-5m-e-jean-carroll-judgment/"&gt;bid to overturn the $5 million jury verdict&lt;/a&gt; against him in New York journalist E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Manhattan on Monday upheld the May 2023 civil verdict finding Trump, 78, liable for sexually abusing the “Ask E. Jean” advice columnist in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in 1996 and of then defaming her in a lengthy October 2022 Truth Social post calling her claims a “hoax.” &lt;/p&gt;

Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against him. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel of the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals said they weren’t persuaded by Trump’s claims that Manhattan federal Judge Lewis Liman abused his discretion at trial by giving the jury certain evidence, including &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/04/trump-called-access-hollywood-tape-old-news-in-deposition/"&gt;the infamous 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape&lt;/a&gt; in which Trump was caught saying he grabs women by their genitals and they let him because he’s a star.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump had also argued that he should be entitled to a new trial because of alleged errors made by Liman.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;“The district court did not abuse its discretion in making any of the challenged evidentiary rulings,” the appeals ruling read. “The jury made its assessment of the facts and claims on a properly developed record.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is also appealing an $83.3 million jury verdict from January 2024 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/07/us-news/judge-denies-trumps-bid-to-get-out-of-posting-83m-during-verdict-appeal/"&gt;finding Trump damaged Carroll’s reputation&lt;/a&gt; after she first went public with her allegations in June 2019 by claiming he’d never met her, saying she wasn’t his type and calling her a liar who was making up a story to help her sell her new memoir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carroll’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a request for comment Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 48-year-old man was slashed in the neck early Monday in the latest violence on a Big Apple subway.&lt;br&gt;The straphanger was slashed when an argument broke out on the northbound C train platform at 50th Street and 8th Avenue around 1:21 a.m., the NYPD said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photos showed police arresting a suspect — who had blood splashed over his sneakers — near 59th Street and Columbus Circle. Charges are pending, police said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former governor and potential mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo opposes Gov. Kathy Hochul’s controversial&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/hochul-announces-nyc-congestion-pricing-to-begin-january/"&gt; $9 congestion toll &lt;/a&gt;to enter Midtown Manhattan, The Post has learned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is undeniable that New York is in a dramatically different place today than it was in 2019, and without a study forecasting [the toll’s] consequences based on facts, not politics, it could do more harm than good to New York City’s recovery,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told The Post on Sunday, referring to his boss’s stance on the new commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuomo is sort of the father of congestion pricing in the US. He was largely responsible for muscling the first-in-the-nation congestion toll plan through New York’s legislature in 2019 to help fund mass transit and curb traffic in Manhattan’s central business district.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he has since backed off the tactic, writing in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/11/opinion/andrew-cuomo-yes-i-approved-congestion-pricing-but-its-time-to-hit-the-brakes/"&gt;Post op-ed column &lt;/a&gt;in March, “The people of New York know this is not the time to implement congestion pricing,” while citing a shaky post-COVID economic recovery and subway crime.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;He feels the same way now even though the toll was lowered by Hochul from $15 to 9 before it takes effect next Sunday, Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuomo’s reversal comes as he is weighing a political &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/us-news/andrew-cuomo-will-win-nyc-mayor-dem-primary-if-he-runs-thanks-to-ranked-choice-voting-adviser/"&gt;comeback bid &lt;/a&gt;for New York City mayor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/10/andrew-cuomo-resigns-as-governor-of-new-york/"&gt;resigned as &lt;/a&gt;governor in August 2021 after accusations of misconduct and under threat of impeachment — though he’s denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzopardi said Cuomo still believes congestion pricing is “ultimately the right policy” and that’s why he fought to approve it. But “the question is whether now is the right time to implement it,” the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Congestion pricing is premised on a safe and reliable subway system, and given the obvious lack of confidence the public currently has in the subway system – combined with the tenuous state of New York City post-COVID –  the Governor called for a data-driven study on the impact of congestion pricing to inform the timing of such a major policy change and to ensure New York was not creating additional obstacles to its comeback,” Azzopardi said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cuomo was responsible for muscling the first-in-the-nation congestion toll plan through New York’s legislature in 2019 to help fund mass transit and curb traffic in Manhattan’s central business district. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 10 murders in the subway this year, the highest homicide tally in 25 years. That figure includes the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/sebastian-zapeta-calil-charged-in-womans-burning-death-on-nyc-subway-often-bugged-out-after-smoking-k2-shelter-roommate/"&gt;horrifying arson murder &lt;/a&gt;of a sleeping straphanger on a train last week, allegedly at the hands of a sadistic illegal Guatemalan migrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rep for Hochul — who served as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor — fired back at her predecessor’s shifting stand and accused him of “gubernatorial mismanagement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Drivers upset about paying a $9 toll when entering Manhattan should remember two things: Andrew Cuomo is the reason they’re paying a toll, and Kathy Hochul is the reason it’s 40% lower than originally envisioned,” said Hochul spokesman Avi Small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul took office in 2021 — two years after congestion pricing became law — and got to work fixing the mess she inherited at the MTA following a decade of gubernatorial mismanagement,” Small added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hochul lowered the toll from $15 to 9 which takes effect Sunday, Jan. 5. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrew Schwartz / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toll opponents welcomed Cuomo’s change of heart, but noted the ex-governor is the one who put the issue front and center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s nice to see that now Cuomo recognizes what a bad idea congestion pricing is, but we won’t forget that he was the one who signed it into law just like the bail reform and sanctuary state policies that have made us less safe,” said.Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe he should have listened to Republicans before championing these disastrous policies,” added Malliotakis, who also challenged Hochul to ride the subway without her state police security detail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/05/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-considering-delaying-congestion-pricing-report/"&gt;originally tabled &lt;/a&gt;a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited till after the election to push a $9 commuter tax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority also has the authority to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/mta-could-hike-nyc-congestion-toll-by-25-on-gridlock-alert-days-in-surge-pricing-style-tax-squeeze/"&gt;raise the tolls &lt;/a&gt;by 25% on gridlock alert days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hochul, who largely controls the MTA, derailed &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/hochul-puts-brakes-on-congestion-tolls-extra-surge-pricing-squeeze-after-fierce-backlash/"&gt;the gridlock surcharge &lt;/a&gt;last week after an exclusive Post report about the outrageous add-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malliotakis and other congestion-pricing foes are appealing to President-elect Donald Trump, who opposes congestion pricing, to stop the toll, which was approved by the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s an avenue for President Trump to intervene and stop it,” Malliotakis said on 77 WABC radio’s the “Cats Roundtable” show Sunday. “[We] do have a lawsuit still in court, as does New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re still hopeful that we can stop this congestion pricing cash grab that will cost commuters thousands of dollars,” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/most-new-yorkers-loathe-kathy-hochuls-congestion-toll-eye-opening-poll-says/"&gt;majority of New Yorkers &lt;/a&gt;— 51% — oppose a congestion toll on Manhattan commuters, according to a recent Siena College poll. Only 29% of those polled said they were supportive of the congestion tax with another 20% saying they were unsure or were in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The toll is backed by transit advocates and environmental groups, the Regional Planning Association and  the Partnership for the City of New York, a top business advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of a board that doles out state charter-school licenses says Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature should lift the cap on the number of city charters next year so Big Apple students can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The charter licenses approved by lawmakers last year have already been doled out, which means no more of the schools can be approved in the Big Apple because of the cap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should focus more on kids — not politics,” said Joseph Belluck, chairman of the State University of New York committee that reviews and licenses charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are currently 282 charter schools serving nearly 150,000 students in the city.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lifting the cap will help us provide more slots to kids who need it,” said Belluck, whose group, along with the state Education Department, distributes the licenses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently 282 charter schools serving nearly 150,000 students in the city. The charters make up about 15% of publicly funded Big Apple schools. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The alternative, privately managed, publicly funded schools are popular with parents for their rigor but fiercely opposed by the teachers’ union and traditional public-school educators, who say the charters provide unwanted competition, draining them of students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most charter schools have a longer school day and school year than traditional public schools, and studies show their students &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/11/charter-schools-outperform-public-schools-in-us-with-ny-results-among-the-best-in-the-country-study/"&gt;outperform their peers &lt;/a&gt;on standardized math and English exams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“The cap should not only be lifted, but there should be no cap on opportunity,” insisted Eva Moskowitz, founder and CEO of Success Academy, which runs 56 charter schools. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;William Farrington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of charter schools are also non-union, a point of contention in Big Labor New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cap should not only be lifted, but there should be no cap on opportunity,” insisted Eva Moskowitz, founder and CEO of Success Academy, which runs 56 charter schools, the largest charter network in the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All parents deserve a choice about where their kids go to school,” Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lester Long, founder and CEO of the Classical Charter Schools Network, said, “New York City needs great schools so more students can get a great education.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lifting the charter school cap is one prong in improving education in the city,” Long said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A New York school-choice and education-reform group also said it’s time for Albany to do what it considers best for parents and kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lester Long, founder and CEO of the Classical Charter Schools Network, said, “New York City needs great schools so more students can get a great education.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;South Bronx Classical Charter Schools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s long past time to treat students in charters fairly: they deserve equitable funding and access to rental assistance for their buildings” said Crystal McQueen-Taylor, executive director of StudentsFirstNY.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The artificial cap on great schools has also passed its expiration date. Parents and advocates will continue to fight for what our children deserve,” the charter proponent said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a cap of 460 charter schools statewide. But there is a subcap within that cap for New York City that restricts the opening of more charters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the law, there are 84 charters left to be issued outside of the city, where there is less demand. If Albany just eliminated the regional cap, New York City would have access to those 84 charters, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The head of a board that gives out state charter-school licenses says Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature should lift the cap on the number of city charters next year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Seth Harrison/The Journal News part of the USA TODAY NETWORK / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Hochul proposed lifting the cap in the five boroughs but was rebuffed by resistant lawmakers. The compromise was to allow the reissuance of 14 so-called “zombie” licenses from shuttered schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on Sunday claimed there is no public appetite to lift the charter-school cap in the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The charter cap was codified in order to strike the balance between offering some school choice and fulfilling the mandate to keep public schools open, and that balance is needed now more than ever,” said state Sen. John Liu (D-Queens), chairman of the panel on New York City Schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would be nonsensical to lift a statutory limit simply because it’s been reached,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State Assembly Education Committee Chairman Michael Benedetto (D-Bronx) said, “My chamber has always been resistant to charter schools. I don’t see a change happening right now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s office said the governor will lay out her education agenda when she submits her executive budget plan early next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Governor Hochul has made record investments in education, increasing school aid by $6.5 billion since taking office, and she will continue working with the Legislature to deliver high quality educational opportunities to New York students. The Governor will unveil her FY26 Budget this winter during the 2025 Legislative session,” a spokesperson for the governor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep spinning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bryant Park’s iconic carousel is back up and running two days after a fire &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/fire-erupts-at-bryant-parks-holiday-market-in-nyc/"&gt;tore through a nearby stall &lt;/a&gt;at the green space’s famed holiday market and shuttered several kiosks until further notice, workers told The Post on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bryant Park’s iconic holiday market is back up and running two days after a fire tore through one of its vendors’ stalls and shuttered several kiosks until further notice. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LP MEDIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 19-year-old carousel worker who only gave the initials KM estimated that the carousel ride, located steps away from where Friday’s fire erupted, lost thousands of dollars on the day of the blaze when it had to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The park attraction was back up and spinning the next day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to close for the day,” KM said. “I was coming into work that day, but then before I left my house, I got a message from my boss, and they were like, ‘Hey, there’s a fire. So you can’t come in to work today.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The raging fire at Seapark – a kiosk offering lobster rolls and seafood fries – was “accidental, caused by cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles,” the FDNY said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Provided by Matthew Lief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trinity Thompson, a stall worker at nearby Babka Bailout, said the fire clean-up effort “was just really fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fire department came [and] blew it out. And then I think two, three hours later, it was just cleaned up in the parking lot. It’s business as usual,” said Thompson, 24.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The employee she wasn’t working when the fire broke out about 9:20 a.m. She said the blaze didn’t have a big impact on Babka Bailout, which is near the Seapark seafood kiosk where the fire originated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The raging fire at a stall for Seapark – which offers lobster rolls and seafood fries – was “accidental, caused by cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles,” the FDNY said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blaze appeared to have started as a trash fire, sources told The Post, and then spread to the 6-foot-by-40-foot kiosk. The fire was placed under control by around 10 a.m., officials said later Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was slight damage to the adjacent kiosk, and there was some heat impingement on the roof of the ice-skating rink behind the kiosk on fire,” FDNY Chief of Battalion 9, Joe Castellano, told reporters at the time. “No real fire spread, just some flame impingement, and you see a little browning of the white roof structure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seapark is one of four kiosks that remain closed until further notice because of the blaze. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LP MEDIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the swift recovery effort, not all businesses seemed to get back up on their feet as quickly as others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seapark is one of four kiosks that remain closed until further notice, according to the vendor’s social media pages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiosks for Down the Chimney, Criollas and 4×4 Burger were also shuttered fornow, Seapark said. The holiday market is due to close its doors Jan. 5. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Firefighters battled the holiday market blaze at about 9:20 a.m. Friday. It was placed under control within the hour, officials said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My parents and I have worked so hard to keep this business going for the last few years, and we are now going to endure an extremely heavy lost [sic],” Seapark founders’ son Daniel Xie wrote in a GoFundMe post for the eatery, which amassed nearly half of its $9,000 goal in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most vendors told The Post their business hadn’t been affected by the blaze – and unaffected stalls were able to open starting later in the day Friday – KM reported the carousel’s workers weren’t paid for the day off. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m not too worried about the carousel making money, but … I did not get paid for not coming in that day,” KM said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of a bummer, but, you know, s–t happens,” he said. “But still, that kind of sucks, especially during the holidays – [not] being able to help out my family” with the extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s unclear what sparked the 2 a.m. argument at Bagel Depot on Richmond Avenue, but the hoodie-wearing suspect pulled out a knife to settle it, police sources told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two victims at the deli &amp;#8212; a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl &amp;#8212; had left the shop after the dispute and went to their Chesebrough Street house, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;img width="962" height="590" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/3854-richmond-ave-staten-island-95970479.jpg?w=1024" alt="The deli exterior" class="wp-image-34238851"&gt;A masked suspect argued with a pair of teens at this Staten Island deli, then followed them home and slashed them, cops said.  &lt;p class="credit"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the knife-wielding maniac followed them and pounced once they arrived at the residence, slashing the man on the right leg and cutting the girl&amp;#8217;s arm. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 14-year-old boy came out of the house during the dispute, and the suspect slashed him on the right knee, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;


	 



&lt;p&gt;Cops arrived after a 911 call and found the wounded trio, the NYPD said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Authorities brought them to Staten Island University North Hospital in stable condition. &lt;/p&gt;



 



&lt;p&gt;There haven&amp;#8217;t been any arrests, and the investigation is ongoing, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Long Island man fatally stabbed his mom on Christmas Eve while she made dinner at their Massapequa home, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Ramirez, 27, was booked Saturday in the horrific holiday slaying. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On this particular evening, it was just him and his mother at the house, Jeremy and his mom. Mom was making some food for dinner,” said Detective Sgt. Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Homicide Squad at a press briefing Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/long-island/long-island-mom-christmas-eve-stabbing/6087881/"&gt;NBC-TV News in New York reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

class="credit"&gt;NBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He stabbed her multiple times and is observed discarding the knife outside the premise,” Fitzpatrick said. “Unknown what provoked him to attack his mother, but based on his history and his violent nature, anything could have set him off to make him attack his mother like that.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramirez had just returned from a local laundromat when he flew into a rage at the home and repeatedly stabbed his mother — identified by cops as Josefina Ramirez Montero, 57 — in the chest and abdomen, according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pdcn.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=13742"&gt;Nassau County police said&lt;/a&gt; officers were dispatched to the home on Old Sunrise Highway and found the victim unresponsive in the living room. She was pronounced dead at the hospital, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her son has a criminal record dating to 2018, including busts for assault and weapons possession charged stemming from a bat assault on a victim, the outlet said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would argue that New York City is mired in a housing crisis — as defined by high prices and low vacancies. There’s good evidence for that conclusion. The most recent federal &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023%20NYCHVS%20Selected%20Initial%20Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported a vacancy rate of just 1.4%, “a stark contrast to the 4.54 rate in 2021”.  Over the same period, median monthly rent rose from $1,500 to $,1641 — and that includes everything from luxury high-rises to public housing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Maggie Brunn, president of Brooklyn’s A&amp;amp;E Real Estate, says rent-regulated apartments are languishing on the NYC market.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These sorts of figures drive an ongoing search for solutions to the problem — including, most recently, Mayor Adams’ Dec. 12 announcement of a new city &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/916-24/mayor-adams-new-charter-revision-commission-continue-important-work-tackling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charter Revision Commission&lt;/a&gt; to consider, as he put it, how to “deliver as much affordable housing to working-class New Yorkers and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A thorough examination of New York’s housing policy — both at the city and state level — could include a growing body of economic research regarding rent regulation, which affects the 960,000 “rent-stabilized” apartments whose price is set not by the market but by mayoral appointees. Rent stabilization may provide a good deal for those lucky to benefit from it. But as economists from across the political spectrum increasingly concur, it ultimately harms the city’s housing market for many.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into the impact of rent control has a long history. Back in 1997, the Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Erzo Luttner described the “misallocation of housing” that rent controls creates. That was their term for a mismatch between what renters might need and what they choose because the price is cheap — such as folks who might only need a small apartment, but live in a big one because they can afford it. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2018, the liberal &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt; cited the same problem: “Once a tenant has secured a rent-controlled apartment, he may not choose to move in the future and give up his rent control, even if his housing needs change.” This “misallocation,” Brookings continued, is not without major consequence, most notably “empty-nest households living in family-sized apartments and young families crammed into small studios.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023%20NYCHVS%20Selected%20Initial%20Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt; analysis of New York housing data suggests that’s exactly what is happening here  — as young people crammed into subdivided studios with multiple roommates know well.  The difference between rent-regulated and market-rate housing in the Big Apple is stark: Only 94,000 (24%) rent-stabilized tenants had moved (either in or out) in the past year, compared to 221,000 (57%) of market-rate tenants.  Rent-stabilized tenants are more likely to stay put — forming a kind of housing blockade for newcomers or households with kids who need more bedrooms. As per the Census, the long-term rent-stabilized tenants were not necessarily low-income: 30% reported incomes above $100,000 a year—in keeping with notorious &lt;a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2008/07/15/decoding-new-york-city-s-rent-stabilized-mysteries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; of the actress Mia Farrow and Congressman Charles Rangel enjoying rent-stabilized units. (Farrow inherited hers through her family, as the law permits.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Decades ago Harvard economistsEdward Glaeser spoke about the “misallocation” of housing created by rent regulations. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rent controls, notes the &lt;a&gt;Journal of Housing Economics&lt;/a&gt;, lead to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/redistribution-of-income" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;redistribution of income&lt;/a&gt; — which can include tenants who become better off at the expense of landlords. As Kenny Burgos, the former Bronx Assemblyman who now heads the New York Apartment Association (NYAA) — which represents the owners of some 400,000 regulated units — notes, the current system “inhibits the natural flow and movement of a normal housing market.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There can be ill-effects on housing quality too, economists are finding, in ways that harm rent-stabilized tenants themselves. In February, 2024,  ceonomists at the &lt;a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/feb/what-are-long-run-trade-offs-rent-control-policies#:~:text=Economists%20generally%20have%20found%20that,thereby%20exacerbating%20affordable%20housing%20shortages." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank&lt;/a&gt; looked at the physical effects of rent controls. They concluded that “while rent-control policies do restrict rents at more affordable rates, they can also lead to a reduction of rental stock and maintenance, thereby exacerbating affordable housing shortages.” Similarly, new research in the &lt;a href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272391/1-s2.0-S1051137723X00060/1-s2.0-S1051137724000020/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEPP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDKPidH7r8fPkDheUmre3fVkRrPyGsYOPEFT2WSmyp8NQIgZmZlLR3UhGhLrR7XUsFZFDKDHmIQL0X20tqxcQADbSkqvAUIrP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDM0I727SPxkryq8ErCqQBZRkRTsdKJPWTT%2FTmLSHVbVTZzIPBPlpTHDoHs1knZSc%2BW7DTd1iOTWn36Y32R8KYUt%2FY70AHQrdy3HjtKa1L3vJ57PWBZ5lwef2gdW%2BWQkhD9mD1IKcwCK%2BeClCZr5YD%2F6zZlm6kN%2Fh3KPo%2FO%2Fgcj6wD2jdnzFyivr5iiatntqW3Y1sU6VQmKxdy%2FbETac5Hrrbt0eHKbx9wyDMJfmEfQrjirtjGK7UieKWoQz9rU2SXZVvG8lR4jZ1V6hGU223gTWB2HM2msd65HnxTRhLVr7nWDXx5yNDwIAXXDBJEt0%2BkYj3FSLDkZ6BDC3vGIjfT8AjbAUi6ooV0mXKJK9GUdtIM%2BL8fIGZYmM%2B2%2B6zmlGPZsZGDsFtJ5khoTHx0879WYzAgmo2N2J6Q9d8bQJ1H9rk6DJu3AzdkCNbQ8RyVZx%2BOFplWHZwdvKgrX%2Fnhb3Wu7xFgeGoKrJu4XnuNqqfD37b7fH3J2vVR9gG45ZJNK71LQyy9Oe1%2FlYFraQK5fGR6KByi4awlJ0xrNuInDfiywgWat%2FwFwPPoBLmQ3flJKW7Z49002ETJkCN%2B6WytZQ4LwoESDoBp9wxtPLqU6fr8xS%2BS%2Bzzz7ZAvhq18S0DAa1iv2PDTi6XRUN5YB898ccSwusw8IsY4QEScLm4HxqU79%2Bse7Oi38htdVrbIiS3CkfXCfDyqkzo%2F2UXb40jJGmlEG4MrsE4H3czTYsEb92U9vKH4FiLJNnM55PBmU577Sag0oBKnDsCDrFVXCLdTVyBi7RP8ogKjUdtgBq71KBZ7cZKeVNujuh0Jfg1Rmjw1KluUTcuQCqa2hcXtYgZOk4dC1rM4uzwOTdZ4iHa439jnRFggvij%2BPOuXOdgilwsUubnMNO857oGOrEBy9zv96OqpezQ4Uy2Ti%2FvtmW%2FdOn0FYrqsU42G9kjfMB7enYQOkHTkzQ73zxPCdVP2N59aWLdYbHa4EQEp%2BSK%2FTp%2BdnoH0zXFxWHeexvN06hoQQOqsVuLGQqR3zk3Ih0d%2BG5medpTnwhv5hqMclNbT62QtCtj0kWNcpDvzos%2FVqjUIWQxLgP1xIhtBosQo95xY27a8PBz2xkqbYwW%2F5MKof9Bbu9qISZo7icLtmkmvuiM&amp;amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20241211T195001Z&amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYVODNFNCB%2F20241211%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=09419784741bf462c7c3d09c47cfc075876cf0d4b7e4c6411caed22fecc5b31b&amp;amp;hash=9cc03966255e232eeef47845ffc59c0912d31f42434586aad22a3a1acad26552&amp;amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;amp;pii=S1051137724000020&amp;amp;tid=spdf-6c1542a3-346c-4aaf-8003-c1831217065a&amp;amp;sid=a563577e7c8958456b88d1f-fc21f4bd8795gxrqa&amp;amp;type=cli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Housing Economics&lt;/a&gt; from March 2024 concluded that “even tenants in the controlled dwellings can suffer from rent control, as maintenance of such dwellings can be reduced, leading to a decreased housing quality.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Actor Mia Farrow is one of the many high-profile New Yorkers who famously live in a rent-regulated home. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Peterson / SplashNews.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, the most recent findings from New York reveal these very same market conditions. Its review of “reported housing problems” found that there are more tenant complaints about rodents, leaks, cracks and heating in rent-stabilized units than in the non-regulated. The numbers are striking: 376,000 reports of rodents in regulated units (39% of all), compared to 240,000 in market-rate units (22% of all).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The repair needs of older, rent-regulated buildings can even lead to owners simply abandoning them, as Maggie Brunn, president of Brooklyn’s A&amp;amp;E Real Estate, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/nyregion/how-to-fix-nyc-housing-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;. “When an apartment has been lived in for 20 or 30 years, those limits [on rent increases] don’t even come close to the actual costs of rewiring, plumbing and the basic improvements you’d need to rent an apartment that a family would be proud to call home. That means more and more of those desperately needed low-rent apartments are sitting vacant.” That problem has been exacerbated by 2019 &lt;a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/rent-stabilization-and-emergency-tenant-protection-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York state legislation&lt;/a&gt; which sharply limits rent increases even for rising costs such major capital repairs.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Argentine Pres. Javier Milei deregulated homes in the nation’s capitol, Buenos Aires. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefano Costantino/SOPA Images/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burgos of the NYAA estimates at&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/12/rent-control-in-nyc-could-become-the-new-abortion/"&gt; least 10,000 of such “ghost apartments” lie vacant&lt;/a&gt; — because their owners “aren’t allowed to recoup their costs. Inflation, property taxes, insurance.” As a result, he says, “banks won’t lend to them.”  That’s exactly what Brookings has found. “Rent control can also lead to decay of the rental housing stock; landlords may not invest in&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/#:~:text=Rent%20control%20can%20also%20lead%20to%20decay%20of%20the%20rental,offered%20potential%20benefits%20for%20tenants." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; maintenance because they can’t recoup these investment by raising rents.” &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The system,” says Burgos, “is not working either for owners or tenants.” But how could this deeply established system — existing, in one form or other, for more than 50 years — actually be adjusted?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Buenos Aires’ housing stock became more affordable as a result. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;jkraft5 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experience of another major world city, Buenos Aires, Argentina, suggests doing so might not bring on the chaos and price-gouging tenant advocates would suggest. Late last year, libertarian-leaning Argentine President Javier Milei simply “scrapped” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/argentina-milei-rent-control-free-market-5345c3d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rent controls, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;The effect, it reported, is that “the Argentine capital is undergoing a rental-market boom. Landlords are rushing to put their properties back on the market, with Buenos Aires rental supplies increasing by over 170%. While rents are still up in nominal terms, many renters are securing better (or at least fairer) deals, with a 40% decline in the real price of rental properties when adjusted for inflation.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply scrapping rent control like in Buenos Aires would be far more difficult in regulation-laden New York, of course. But, as Burgos notes, even permitting the de-regulation of vacant units could lead to significant improvement — without affecting current tenants.  What he calls “vacancy control” stands in the way of the rent increases owners need to invest simply to comply with building codes and lead abatement laws — rather than leaving units vacant. The city’s Charter Commission could help by reducing property taxes or water rates for regulated units. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luxury apartments such as these are generally exempt from rent regulations, which furthers the city’s housing imbalance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even a rapid deregulation might not be that consequential in much of the city.  Census survey reports that the typical market-rate rent ($2,000) is not fantastically higher than the typical regulated rent ($1,500). In The Bronx, the typical rent for all units — including non-rent stabilized — is just $1,200.  Market rents, in other words, can be close to regulated rents in lower-cost neighborhoods. Combined with a wave of vacant units coming back on the market and new investments, New York might follow (or at least tiptoe) in the footsteps of Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a move would not only benefit renters, it would save the city the expenses associated with an agency most metropolises don’t possess, the Rent Stabilization Guidelines Board, whose staff sets rent increase recommendations and monitors compliance. What’s more, property owners — including mom-and-pop landlords who own just a few buildings — would no longer have to incur the red tape headaches of registering their buildings every year — and either mailing or hand-delivering the required forms and fees, to be paid, for each unit, both to the state ($13) and the city ($20).  Failing to do so means a &lt;a href="https://rsanyc.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/February-2024_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;$500 fine — per apartment. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Efforts to roll back rent regulations were placed before the Supreme Court recently. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts, led by the owners’ lobby, the Rent Stabilization Association (now part of the New York Housing Association), to upend the price control regime through the courts — without success.  Most recently, the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-wont-hear-clash-over-new-york-rent-stabilization-laws-2024-11-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;US Supreme Court declined a challenge based&lt;/a&gt;, in part, on the argument that rent regulation was effectively a legal “taking of an owner’s property, without compensation.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that property owners sought to overturn rent regulation through the courts makes clear how difficult it is to change the system legislatively. But city and state officials should take notice of the changing leadership in Washington. In the first Trump Administration, a &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-HH14-PURL-gpo173032/pdf/GOVPUB-HH14-PURL-gpo173032.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;White House Executive Council&lt;/a&gt; singled out rent control for criticism, writing that it can lead to “restricted supply [which] ends up hurting some of the lower-income renters they are intended to help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To the chagrin of many landlords, the Supreme Court found rent regulation to be constitutional  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Trump may take a less favorable view of rent rent regulations. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KEN BLEVINS/WILMINGTON STAR-NEWS / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York City’s budget relies on Washington for $100 billion in revenue, including from the Department of Housing and Urban Development — which could attach strings to that aid, including revisions to rent regulation or calling for it to end. Once back in office, Donald Trump — as he often does — could prove a wild card and deregulate New York City’s housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian Angels will start patrolling New York City subway cars once again in response to the the horrifying murder of a sleeping passenger, who was burned to death on the F train last week, the group announced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ever since the horrifying incident, “hundreds of citizens” have requested the Guardian Angels return to patrol the subway cars, the group — which was founded in 1979 in response to sky-high subway crime — said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group’s latest strategy, outlined by founder Curtis Sliwa, will focus on conducting wellness checks on homeless people and emotionally disturbed individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was the “sunshine” of her office — until she asked for equal pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A News12 anchor claims her simple claim for equity resulted in such harsh blowback from her network that she had a psychotic break and ended up on suicide watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annalisa Klebers, &lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/news-12-networks-win-21-excellence-in-journalism-awards-from-connecticut-spj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an award-winning journalist&lt;/a&gt; who anchored the morning news for Altice USA-owned News12 stations in Connecticut and New Jersey, said the sudden change in her boss’ demeanor came  after she asked about a new contract with better pay than the $71,000 she’d been getting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Klebers spent six days on suicide watch. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What resulted, she claims, was months of being “gaslit” by supervisors, excluded from meetings, and having more and demeaning work piled on her — including fixing her co-anchor’s typos.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What management did to me changed my life forever. I almost lost my life. My children came very close to almost losing their mother,” she told The Post. “I felt like my whole world was caving in.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Klebers, a 42-year-old mother of three, was hired in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her supervisors praised her intelligence and work ethic, calling her the “sunshine of the newsroom,” according to a claim filed with the American Arbitration Association and obtained by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, she was frequently one of just two people in the building, responsible for everything from her own work to “making sure the cameras, lights, and teleprompter were working” and covering then-Gov. Cuomo’s daily news conferences, according to the claim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The efforts earned her yet more praise and a $4,200 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Klebers, a 42-year-old mother of three, was hired in April 2018. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But co-workers were getting double that amount, she learned. And when she voiced concerns to her managers, the sun began to set on her career at the station, Klebers contended in papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I felt humiliated,” she said. “I was being alienated from the rest of the news team. Management began blaming technical difficulties on me that I had no control over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I did everything managers asked of me and more,” she added. “This all while my contract and pay raise were being held over my head. It felt like management wanted me to quit or react poorly to the things they were doing to me.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Her supervisors praised her intelligence and work ethic, calling her the “sunshine of the newsroom.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was cut out of a promotional advertisement featuring storm coverage she helmed — while a male colleague who called out that day was edited into the footage, she claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klebers put in a formal complaint but then ultimately decided to resign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Altice refused to accept her departure, ostensibly because the company claimed it was required to investigate her complaint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It all sent me into a spiral,” she said. “It was too much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The former anchor alleges she was “gaslit” by management.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On Friday, May 13, 2022, I became very ill,” Klebers said. “I had a psychotic break. I was suicidal. This all happened in front of my husband and children and even my sister.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her husband Erik said “she became almost catatonic, staring into space, moving around the house inexplicably.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She kept trying to grab her car keys and heading to the garage, Erik Klebers said, which doctors later confirmed was her attempt at suicide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She spent six days in the psych ward on suicide watch. She was later fired by Altice while out on disability.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;News12 co-anchors Rick Holmes and Annalisa Klebers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy or Annalisa Klebers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her career was completely derailed, such to the point that she does not see any avenue back to an anchor desk, not at News12 or any media, any newsroom anywhere,” said her attorney, Anthony Mango. “This was brought about by her just making in good faith, raising an issue for the equal pay. “It’s really rendered her disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Klebers wants the American Arbitration Association to award her the income she would have made as an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She chose to go public because “this cannot happen to another person, woman or man, that works in a corporate environment. It should be criminal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An Altice USA spokesperson said, “News 12 prides itself on providing an inclusive and equitable workplace where employees can thrive and are compensated based on their skills, contributions, and merit; any gender discrimination claims are entirely baseless, and we will defend against them vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man was gunned down in Hell’s Kitchen on Saturday after arguing with a rival, cops and witnesses said — as crime continues to rise in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharief Jackson was blasted twice in the chest shortly before 3 am inside his apartment on 49th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues, according to the NYPD and residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police found him in front of the 5-story building bleeding out and conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medics rushed him to NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue but he could not be saved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His killer was still on the loose Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A resident told The Post she heard yelling before three gunshots rang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold-blooded killing comes as murder surged by 66.7% this year compared to 2023 in Midtown North Precinct, with five homicides recorded through Dec. 15, according to NYPD &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-018pct.pdf"&gt;crime stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robberies, assaults, rape and burglaries are also up, leaving locals rattled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived here for years,” said 67-year-old Thomas Kurilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It got really nice. It got gentrified and then it’s back to 1980s all over again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A resident leaving Jackson’s building — which was wrapped in crime scene tape hours after the murder — echoed those sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a scary time around Hell’s Kitchen. It’s unfortunate to see the direction it’s gone. I hope it gets better. This street used to be better,” he said, adding he was headed to Australia for vacation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It couldn’t be a better time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Hechtman, a beloved and irascible New York Post editor who spent more than four decades at the tabloid, died Friday from lymphoma. He was 82. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The veteran newsman died in his sleep at Methodist Home for Nursing and Rehabilitation in the Bronx, according to his longtime friend, Shelagh Masline.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A night editor with a gallows humor and penchant for belting out Sondheim tunes, Hechtman mentored generations of reporters at The Post, giving scores of young journalists their first break, former colleagues and proteges said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman passed away in his sleep at Methodist Home for Nursing and Rehabilitation in the Bronx. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would have nothing without Mike — I would not have been a reporter,” said former Post journo Jennifer Fermino.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hechtman infamously would have cub reporters sit beside him at his desk, where he would tear their stories to shreds to teach them how to write for the tabloid. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“One of the first things he would do is create a huge gap, six to seven spaces between your byline and what was your lede, because you were going to start over again,” said former Post reporter and Metro Editor Eric Lenkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman was infamously known for mentoring young reporters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook Candace Amos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman, he added,  “gave everyone a shot” at the paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Jay Hechtman was born in Brooklyn on April 5, 1942, to Henry Hechtman, a hat factory owner in the Garment District, and Rose Sass, a homemaker. His family soon moved to Rego Park, Queens, where he later would live for decades in a studio apartment without a stove. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He studied journalism at Brooklyn College, where he worked on the school newspaper, and later received a graduate degree from the University of Michigan, according to Masline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman was born in Brooklyn in 1942. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Annie Wermiel/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served in the US Army Reserves, where he handled writing press releases at Fort Dix in New Jersey, according to copy editor Milton Goldstein. He was honorably discharged in 1971. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following reporting stints at the Hartford Courant and the Associated Press, Hechtman joined The Post in 1974 as a reporter, and soon cemented his status as “super rewrite man” — transforming street reporters’ harried notes into seamless prose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The night that [Yankees catcher] Thurman Munson died in the plane crash in the late 70s, [Post Publisher Rupert] Murdoch said I want your best man on this story,” former city editor Dick Belsky recalled. “Without hesitation we gave it to Hechtman.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman previously served in the US Army Reserves, being honorably discharged in 1971.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook Candace Amos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a night editor, Hechtman gained notoriety for his tendency to wake up reporters with zero qualms at 2 a.m. to answer questions about their stories. He also had an uncanny ability to trim overwritten stories to their tabloid essence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He could take a 20-paragraph story and turn it into a haiku, that’s how good he was,” recalled former Post reporter Cynthia Fagen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His newsroom eccentricities included regular bathroom announcements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman joined The Post in 1974.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He had this routine at night where he’d go to the bathroom and announce to the newsroom, ‘If Madonna calls for me, I’m in the middle stall,’ ‘If the Pope calls for me, I’m in the middle stall,'” Belsky recalled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fermino recalled Hechtman kept of collection of headlines that were “too rude” to go in the paper. And he once  rewrote the lyrics of “Oklahoma!” to be about the Jewish new year: “Rosh Hashana, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains / and the matzoh ball stands proud and tall / we know we belong to the shul / and the shul we belong to is cool / and when we say vey, oy vey oy vey oy vey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;His newsroom eccentricities included regular bathroom announcements. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman was passionate about the New York City transit system – and cats, combining his two loves by naming his many feline companions over the years after the city’s various rail systems and companies, including “BMT” for the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corp. and “Metro-North.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He got his pilot’s license around 1979 following a trip to the South Pacific, and for a decade would fly friends and colleagues on a twin-engine Cessna for getaways to Newport and Martha’s Vineyard, Masline said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;After retiring from The Post in 2014, Hechtman returned to edit part-time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NY Post Brian Zak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After retiring in 2014, Hechtman returned to edit part-time at The Post, where he wrote the column “Weird But True.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mike was New York City,” said former Post scribe Linda Massarella. “The five boroughs were like his own fingerprints — he just knew every inch of it — and as a new reporter, it was awesome to prowl the streets knowing the best editor on the planet had my back.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hechtman, who battled dementia for the past five years, had no living relatives but is survived by Masline and her daughter Cailtin as well as her daughter’s fiancé Eddie Wooden, Masline said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hechtman battled dementia for the past five years. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Annie Wermiel/NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 letter to Masline, he asked her to inform The Post’s editors that they should not print an obituary for him when he dies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; claimsA P.J. Clarke’s general manager sexually harassed and assaulted a bartender, and even tried to convince her to ditch her hubby in a sick bid to “ruin” the woman’s marriage, according to a new lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amber Daza, 31, was subjected to “unwelcome sexual advances” by her supervisor, Kairsten Nunn, at the  Lincoln Square location of the famous, century-old bar and grill starting in April, according to the Manhattan federal court filing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn allegedly visited Daza’s apartment, insisted on staying overnight, and told Daza she might not “be able to control herself” if she slept over.&lt;/p&gt;

Clarke’s, according to a lawsuit. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram @amberlee_nyc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn said she could give Daza better bartending shifts to make more money and “be near her more often,” according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mother’s Day, Nunn sent Daza $30 so she could get a gift for her mom — which Daza says she immediately sent back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During what was supposed to be a work meeting in May, Nunn allegedly showed up drunk and made sexual advances toward Daza. She suggested Daza might need to “move on” from her husband and asked if she had ever “been with” a woman before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn then grabbed Daza’s neck and tried to kiss her, leaving a bruise, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Daza did not reciprocate the advances, said she was uncomfortable, asked Nunn to be respectful and told her to stop, according to the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next day, Nunn allegedly sent Daza apology texts, saying, “That was not me, it was the liquor” and “I f–ked up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza filed a police report in June and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint in July, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza says she was retaliated against with less desirable shifts and had tips kept from her after the filed the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleagues told Daza that Nunn said she wanted to “ruin” Daza’s marriage, the suit charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The filing also alleges Nunn had sexual relationships with other subordinates and offered them scheduling benefits and “favorable conditions” in exchange for sex, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human resources and Daza’s managers knew about the alleged harassment but did nothing about it, according to the suit, which names Nunn, P.J. Clarke’s Lincoln Square and its management company, SLH Management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daza is seeking unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn eventually resigned — it is not clear exactly when — but P.J. Clarke’s “delayed meaningful intervention” and fostered a “hostile work environment” in the meantime, subjecting Daza and others to continued harassment, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the parties did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Queens public high-school teacher created a creepy “escape room” where he allegedly sexually abused a female student, according to a troubling new report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scott Biski, a music teacher at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, also invited the girl to his home — calling it “the bat cave” — for sex when his wife and two kids were not home, investigators allege.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski, 50, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/nyc-teacher-accused-of-grooming-sexually-assaulting-student-for-years-then-sued-doe-for-not-funding-his-defense/"&gt;began “grooming” the student&lt;/a&gt; when she was 14, a sophomore, and it culminated when she was a senior into “a sexual relationship,”&lt;a href="https://nycsci.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Biski-20225144_redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; charges a report &lt;/a&gt;by the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Students allegedly hung out with music teacher Scott Biski in his classroom-office, which was transformed into a creepy “escape room” with old desks and file cabinets. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;biskisan/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I now understand that these weird hugs, embraces were actually just groping,” the now 25-year-old ex-student told investigators in 2022. “He was touching me for sexual pleasure without my consent.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biski arranged “makeshift dividers and old desks” in his music classroom and office, inviting students to hang out in his “escape room.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There, Biski touched the student’s breasts and tried to kiss her, prompting the girl to pull away and “promptly” leave, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Biski would also invite the girl to his home to play board games with other kids. Once, she arrived to find she was the only student there, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski also gave the girl lavish gifts, such as a flute that was only supposed to be lent to students, his favorite childhood book, new clothes and cash, including $200 for Ugg boots, it says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SCI found that he messaged the teen nearly 700 times, 82 times during school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski told the girl to save his number under a fake name – “Arthur Dent” — “so as to not arouse suspicion,” she told investigators.  Another student told SCI he believed the alias was “Harvey Dent,” a Batman villain whose alter ego was “Two-Face.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biski resigned from his post at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, but wasn’t charged criminally. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski forcibly kissed and groped the student in his school office and forced her to touch his erection, telling her, “That’s how you make me feel,” according to court documents and the SCI report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biski assigned the student to play lead flute in the school band, gave her coveted solos and wrote “outstanding” college recommendation letters for her, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These were things he did as a part of his grooming process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once she graduated, she told investigators, Biski would allegedly “pester” her into coming to his house when his wife and two kids were gone to engage in sex acts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the perverted texts continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No Halloween party? No slut outfit?” he texted her during her first year in college. “No ‘I’m little red riding hood the whore.'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, he wrote, “I have risked everything for you. My job. My home. My kids. Everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The student told investigators she was “disgusted” by his behavior because she saw Biski as a “father figure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biski gave the girl lavish gifts and messaged her nearly 700 times, according to investigators. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;biskisan/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD closed a criminal case against Biski because the student said the sexual contact was consensual and occurred after she turned 17, but the teacher’s behavior was “egregious, manipulative, and predatory,” the SCI charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the student came forward in June 2022, the city Department of Education &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/25/back-to-back-sex-misconduct-cases-upset-queens-high-school/"&gt;removed Biski from Gateway,&lt;/a&gt; but he remained on the city payroll until last year, collecting $99,578 in fiscal year 2024, records show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has “irrevocably resigned,” a DOE spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides recommending Biski’s termination, SCI called on the DOE to amend its guidelines on teachers using private phone numbers to text kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SCI has&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/11/us-news/schools-watchdog-begs-doe-to-ban-teacher-student-texting/"&gt; repeatedly urged the DOE&lt;/a&gt; to ban employees from contacting students’ cell phones and social media accounts. In the past five years, it has found at least 89 cases of DOE employees having inappropriate conversations with students via text and online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, the 25-year-old former student filed a lawsuit, charging Biski with harassment and sexual assault. In June, Biski sued the DOE for denying him legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Biski did not respond to inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homeless man &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/man-56-burned-inside-nycs-penn-station-cops-probing-cause-of-injuries/"&gt;who sustained burns to both legs and his upper body&lt;/a&gt; after catching fire inside Penn Station late Friday is now believed to have set himself ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police and MTA sources told The Post on Saturday there is no evidence that a second person was involved in the shocking incident. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD officers investigate the scene where a man was found on fire Friday night. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Officers from the NYPD search the secluded tunnel for clues after a man was found on fire. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The station was cordoned off to commuters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 67-year-old man, who police have yet to identify, was found on fire by first responders at around 8 p.m. in a secluded tunnel not far from New Jersey Transit Tracks 11 and 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was rushed to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in stable condition. On Saturday, medical personnel upgraded him to critical.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The victim told police he awoke to find he was on fire, and claimed the blaze was set by someone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the fire began, but no criminality appears to be involved, sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident had commuters nevertheless shaken, with crime underground on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Portions of Penn Station were blocked off from commuters. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The man was found by first responders in a tunnel near NJ Transit Tracks 11 and 12. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Friday’s shocking incident unfolded just days after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/horror-video-shows-suspect-watching-woman-burn-to-death-in-f-train-car-after-he-allegedly-set-her-on-fire/"&gt;a still-unidentified woman was torched to death&lt;/a&gt; while sleeping on an F train in Brooklyn on Dec. 23.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s crazy,” commented Mike Jones, 28, a school safety officer from the Bronx who commutes to Penn Station. “I come through this area sometimes. It’s dangerous. It’s scary. Two people on fire, two different stations, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/victim-who-was-stabbed-in-the-throat-by-a-maniac-at-grand-central-station-says-no-one-came-to-her-aid-just-froze/"&gt;two stabbed at Grand Central Station&lt;/a&gt; — that’s dreadful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ashley Cole, from Brooklyn, said he’s disgusted by the crime on the subways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fire fighters were summoned to the scene as well. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ZUMAPRESS.com / MEGA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s completely safe [underground], but I’m not afraid,” the 75-year-old Cole said. “I try to pay attention to my surroundings, and I’m very sorry about what’s happening. I don’t know what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Homeless individuals inside Penn Station told The Post many of them carry matches and lighters, as many smoke crack or synthetic marijuana, like K2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The woman’s arson murder was caught on surveillance video. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murder and arson charges in the F train incident have been filed against &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/us-news/suspect-accused-of-setting-nyc-subway-rider-on-fire-arrested/"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta&lt;/a&gt;, a Guatemalan migrant who had been deported in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers and tourists &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/new-years-eve-ball-unveiled-with-whopping-2688-new-sparking-crystals/"&gt;gathered in Times Square &lt;/a&gt;Saturday to bid “Good Riddance” to bedbugs, belly weight, loud neighbors and feelings for former lovers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 100 people showed up for the 18th annual event — each jotting down and symbolically erasing the grievances they wish to leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For 13-year-old Mason Riddle of Hartselle, Ala., &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/woman-who-wrote-new-years-wish-on-times-square-confetti-in-nyc-reveals-dream-came-true/"&gt;starting the new year with a clean slate&lt;/a&gt; means no more “arguing with my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do it all the time and she’s tired of it,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hundreds celebrated “Good Riddance Day” in Times Square to let go of their grievances for the new year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mom, Jessica Riddle, didn’t see their squabbles severe enough to wipe away on her own miniature chalkboard that the Times Square Alliance doled out. Instead, the single mom of two hopes to get rid of self-doubt and disorganization.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I question myself every day if I’m raising them the right way and I just want to enjoy life and have fun and stop stressing so much,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get a better handle on being organized so things move smoothly in our life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anna Daratany, 57, of Coney Island is bidding goodbye to the hormonal tribulations that accompany menopause — particularly belly weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Georgina Calvillo of Mexico is letting go of feelings for her ex-boyfriend. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The journey has been crazy. It’s been about four years. … You make it, I’ve been through it,” she said with a flourish of positivity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daratany is trying to drop weight and “get on with my golden years,” she said, adding she’d like to lose about 15 pounds: “I know it’s because of the hormones. I know it is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eileen Mullin, 57, of Rego Park is looking forward to standing her ground more in 2025 and not giving in to the demands of others, while new New Yorker Georgina Calvillo, 25, is saying goodbye to a recent heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He wanted to start a family in Mexico but I wanted to see the world here in New York so we decided to break up,” said Calvillo, who is working in the Big Apple as a nanny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 100 people packed into the tourist center Saturday, perhaps none had more to look forward to than Lauren of Williamsburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 29-year-old is saying good riddance to bedbugs, loud neighbors, a bad job and sad feelings in general. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The annual event encourages participants to jot down and symbolically erase the grievances they wish to leave behind this year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“When we reflect on the past, we look to say goodbye to things and good riddance to things,” said Tom Harris of the Times Square Alliance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For the first time this year, some Good Riddance Day messages were displayed on a Times Square billboard. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I live above a really loud pizza shop and it vibrated my floor for a month and a half,” said Lauren, who declined to share her last name, adding that she also suffered from bedbugs after accidentally bringing the pests home from a trip to Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was awful. I had to pack all my stuff up. It was packed up for a month and a half. I was scared to be around people because I didn’t want to give people bedbugs,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a whole thing and during that I was job interviewing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lauren of Williamsburg said she’s already off to a fresh start just a few days out from the new year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Lauren has already turned the page and is enjoying a fresh start — the bedbugs were exterminated on the same day she negotiated a deal with her neighbors to bring down the noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This all changed for me on the same day pretty much. It was my birthday. I got a job offer and I was unpacking from the bed bugs,” Lauren said triumphantly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good Riddance Day is one of several end-of-year events being celebrated in Times Square this weekend ahead of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/lifestyle/nyc-applebees-times-square-new-years-eve-ball-drop-tickets-got-pricier/"&gt;the iconic New Year’s Eve ball drop.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance, a typical list over the years includes money problems, cancer and bad boyfriends. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we reflect on the past, we look to say goodbye to things and good riddance to things,” he told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today is a way to very publicly say good riddance to something in Times Square.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daughter of former Rep. Carolyn Maloney is riding her mother’s coattails in a “shameless” bid to reclaim the 78-year-old Democrat’s old City Council seat, insiders told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virginia Maloney, a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginiamaloney/"&gt;product manager&lt;/a&gt; at Meta, has flaunted her political pedigree in campaign material to potential voters since announcing her bid last month to replace term-limited Democratic Councilman Keith Powers, whose district comprises much of the Upper East Side and Midtown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On her campaign website, the 37-year-old UES native &lt;a href="https://virginiamaloney.com/issues/"&gt;lays out her concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the need for more affordable housing, combating extremism and improving healthcare access — but also leans into family lore of her mother going into labor with her while debating legislation on the City Council floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Insiders said Virginia Maloney, the daughter of former Rep. Carolyn Maloney, is riding her mother’s coattails in a bid for the 78-year-old Democrat’s former City Council seat. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mother — a teacher, City Councilwoman and Member of Congress — taught me to believe in myself as a woman and that when I do, I can get great things done,” the website &lt;a href="https://virginiamaloney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new 30-second &lt;a href="https://x.com/vmmaloney/status/1871247749502599458"&gt;introductory campaign ad&lt;/a&gt;, which briefly touched on Virginia Maloney’s work for the city Economic Development Corp. and later the private tech sector, was similarly ham-fisted in touting the candidate’s lineage, lingering on a clear, striking portrait of her mother as she reminded people that she’s “the daughter of two public servants.” Her late father, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2009/09/27/peak-tragedy-for-maloney/"&gt;Clifton Maloney&lt;/a&gt;, was a former US Navy vet and investment banker.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The elder Maloney, who &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD2OCEuNC6a/"&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDpvR8IyxWn/?img_index=1"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB_sOUeugGS/?img_index=1"&gt;in Instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCSsn9ayA0K/?img_index=1"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on Virginia Maloney’s campaign account, also is being trotted out as a host for her daughter’s campaign fundraisers both &lt;a href="https://contribute.nycvotes.org/campaigns/virginiamaloney/events/2245/contributions/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in Washington DC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://contribute.nycvotes.org/campaigns/virginiamaloney/events/2244/contributions/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Big Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most candidates I’ve worked with who have that sort of dynasty are never this shameless,” one veteran Democratic strategist told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a time and a place to evoke your mom, but from Day One, in such an aggressive way, strikes me as obscenely lazy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 30-second introductory campaign ad foisted upon viewers a photo of the elder Maloney while touting Virginia as being the daughter of public servants. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FaceBook Virginia Maloney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/VSApps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2909&amp;amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;amp;cand_name=Maloney,%20Virginia&amp;amp;office=CD%2004&amp;amp;report=summ"&gt;campaign filings&lt;/a&gt; in October, Virginia Maloney had yet to document any contributions, according to campaign records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second Democratic strategist, meanwhile, suggested Virginia Maloney’s bid for City Council is ultimately a “proxy” for her mother to eventually reclaim her old congressional seat after being trounced by fellow Manhattan Rep. Jerry Nadler in the bitter 2022 Democratic House primary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Carolyn Maloney has been as visible at events, if not more, than the candidate,” the insider said. “Everyone knows she wants her seat back.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Maloney, who had an estimated net &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/carolyn-maloney/net-worth?cid=N00000078"&gt;worth of $13 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, previously held the City Council District 4 seat representing the Upper East Side from 1982 to 1992. Virginia attended the posh Spence School, where &lt;a href="https://www.spenceschool.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tuition&lt;/a&gt; is an eye-watering $65,846 a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The elder Maloney became a totemic figure on the Upper East Side while representing the neighborhood in Congress.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Maloney went on to represent the nabe in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-maloney-ab940189/"&gt;Congress for another two decades&lt;/a&gt;, where she became a totemic figure in her district for her dogged advocacy to secure funding for the $4.4 billion 2nd Avenue subway line as well as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/former-rep-carolyn-maloney-honored-for-9-11-work-at-us-capitol-with-portrait-of-her-in-firefighter-jacket/"&gt;billions to finance&lt;/a&gt; health programs for 9/11 first responders and the victim’s compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Virginia is lucky to have learned a lot from her mother’s trailblazing career and she will use those lessons to serve her community and the City she loves so much,” said Shelby Garner, a campaign spokesman for Virginia Maloney and her mother’s former district chief of staff. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Maloney name is a “great name that fits the district,” the family legacy will only take her so far in what is shaping up to be a sharply competitive race, warned Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York’s Finest suffered a startling 4,600 injuries at the hands of violent suspects in the first nine months of 2024 – the most since the NYPD started keeping such statistics in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The frightening figure is 13% higher than the 4,077 officer injuries sustained citywide during the same period in 2023, and a whopping 60% higher than the 2,886 logged at that point in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between April and June, 1,640 on- and off-duty cops were hurt by perps – the highest number ever recorded in a single quarter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One top cop blamed the NYPD Bruise on the influx of more than 58,000 migrant criminals into the Big Apple. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fergregory – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the next three months were almost as bad, with 1,618 officer injuries, the second-most on record. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of officer injuries in the first three quarters of 2024 — 4,285 — were minor, but 192 were considered “substantial” and required treatment at a hospital, and 123 were seen as “serious” enough to warrant hospital admission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One top cop blamed the NYPD Bruise on the influx of more than 58,000 migrant criminals into the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“When the laws dictate that there are no meaningful consequences to assaulting police officers and we are housing that very same criminal element free of charge, of course there will be many more interactions with the very same violent individuals we couldn’t prosecute or deport,” SBA President Vincent Vallelong told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/feds-raid-migrant-tren-de-aragua-gang-house-in-nyc-after-tracking-gps-ankle-monitor-to-hideout/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;notorious gang that is poisoning our city&lt;/a&gt; and they are given free passes, jeopardizing the lives of our law enforcement officers and compromising public safety,” he continued, referring to the Venezuelan outlaws known as Tren de Aragua.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot more migrants [assault cops] than regular citizens,” said one officer with more than two decades on the job. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“A lot more migrants [assault cops] than regular citizens,” said one cop with more than two decades on the job.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of last month,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/30/us-news/nyc-is-now-home-to-over-58k-criminal-migrants-including-over-1000-gang-members-ice/"&gt; nearly 8% of the 759,218 illegal migrants&lt;/a&gt; living in New York City were either previously convicted of crimes or had criminal charges pending, according to jaw-dropping ICE data exposed by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one particularly ugly, migrant-fueled incident, two groups of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/us-news/migrants-batter-bite-nypd-cops-at-roosevelt-hotel/"&gt;brawling illegals ganged up on a pair of officers&lt;/a&gt; who arrived to break up a May 19 fight inside of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One officer was bitten in his left arm and bruised on his left leg. Another suffered injuries to his head, right elbow and wrist. One of the heartless assailants even tried to steal an officer’s hat as a trophy, police sources said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both cops were taken to the hospital in stable condition, and four migrants were arrested – three of whom had rap sheets prior to the incident, according to sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;On May 19, two groups of brawling migrants ganged up on a pair of officers who arrived to break up a fight inside of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last month, a 33-year-old migrant from Mexico was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/migrant-attacks-nypd-cops-who-intervene-in-street-brawl-sources/"&gt;busted for attacking two cops&lt;/a&gt; while they tried to cuff him for a street brawl in Elmhurst, Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mauricio David Sosa, who had just punched another man in the face, slugged one cop in the face and kicked another in the lower stomach when they went to arrest him, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sosa was later charged with two counts of felony assault and resisting arrest, police said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mexican national Mauricio David Sosa slugged one cop in the face and kicked another in the lower stomach last month, according to authorities.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the NY POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 27, as many as 14 migrants joined in a&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/30/metro/cops-beaten-by-rowdy-migrant-mob-in-caught-on-video-assault-near-times-square-and-suspects-later-freed-without-bail/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt; vicious, caught-on-camera beating of two police officers&lt;/a&gt; in Times Square. Only one of the suspects was ever jailed, while five were charged but let go without bail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a week later, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/08/metro/7-migrants-now-indicted-in-attack-of-nypd-officers-in-times-square-after-being-freed-without-bail/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;utm_source=message_app"&gt;announced he had indicted seven of the alleged attackers&lt;/a&gt;, but authorities at the time said they had all already fled to California. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond violent migrants, critics cited bail reform and soft-on-crime prosecutors like Bragg for the surge in cop assaults. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The de-carceral approach taken by both district attorneys and judges toward perpetrators who assault police officers is the main driver behind this ever-increasing rise in assaults…The public sees no one is going to jail for it, so it’s ‘I can do what I want,’ ” said NYPD Lt. John Macari.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD bodycam video shows the suspects charged with assaulting two police officers in Times Square on Jan. 27.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Manhattan District Attorney's Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shoplifters, drug dealers, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/us-news/nypd-agitator-allegedly-tossed-flaming-hat-at-cops-nyc-home-during-protest/"&gt;protestors&lt;/a&gt;, and migrants have no fear of putting their hands on anyone – including the police,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Far too many routine calls are turning into all-out brawls, and the reason is obvious: our justice system keeps releasing the same violent, repeat offenders, and they keep attacking cops when we try to lock them up again,” agreed Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Repeat criminal Ernst Delma was on probation Aug. 8 when he &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/female-nypd-cop-punched-in-face-leading-to-wild-caught-on-camera-arrest/"&gt;viciously punched rookie officer Mary Fay&lt;/a&gt; to the ground in the Soundview neighborhood of The Bronx, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Video taken moments after the clobbering shows blood streaming down Fay’s face as a bystander helps her up off the sidewalk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video taken moments after the clobbering – which occurred after Fay tried to break up an argument between Delma, 41, and a group of kids – shows&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/10/us-news/female-nypd-cop-has-long-road-to-recovery-after-being-struck-by-parolee-union-boss/"&gt; blood streaming down the officer’s face&lt;/a&gt; as a bystander helps her up off the sidewalk. Other cops pounced on Delma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fay sustained a cut to her lip and was taken to a local hospital in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delma, who was on probation for a New Jersey conviction at the time, had numerous prior arrests for assault and burglary over the past several years – including a random slugging of a 57-year-old woman in Midtown in July 2022, police sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brute was charged with assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 19, career criminal Gary Worthy was stopped by cops after robbing a Jamaica, Queens smoke shop at gunpoint. Worthy, 57, turned and fired at officers, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/lifetime-parolee-who-shot-nyc-cop-was-cut-loose-by-judge-despite-das-pleas-multiple-arrests/"&gt;striking veteran officer Rich Wong in the thigh&lt;/a&gt;. The wounded hero cop fired back, hitting Worthy in the face and killing him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wong was transported to Jamaica Hospital and released the next morning as more than 200 NYPD cops cheered him on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worthy was already on lifetime parole and had served two stints in state prison before the fatal incident. Just a couple of months earlier, a Queens judge had cut Worthy loose on despite pleas from the Queens District Attorney’s Office to set bail  on a pair of cases for assault and burglary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between August and September, cops from the NYPD’s 46th Precinct suffered the most injuries – 51 – out of all 78 precincts citywide, according to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/11/metro/assaults-on-nypd-cops-have-escalated-to-record-breaking-totals-in-latest-show-of-anti-police-sentiment-full-blown-epidemic/"&gt;“Use of Force” data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Career criminal Gary Worthy shot veteran officer Rich Wong in the thigh on Nov. 19.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kyle Mazza/SOPA Images/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The 46 is one of the more violent commands, and these perps just feel like there’s no consequences,” explained the cop with 20 years on the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stats also show an eye-popping 29% surge in subject injuries in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year, with 4,515 this year compared to 3,497 in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was a 20% increase in the number of interactions between cops and perps where at least one party was injured in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An off-duty New York City cop has been arrested for allegedly raping and strangling someone close to him, sources told The Post Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Samuel Sierra, 35, was arrested around 7:20 p.m. Friday night in East Harlem and charged with first-degree rape, second-degree strangulation and third-degree assault, police confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack was “domestic in nature.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He allegedly attacked a family member or a partner, according to a source who wouldn’t disclose additional details of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sierra was expected to be arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court. He was suspended without pay pending trial.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;He joined the NYPD in 2016 and earned $167,584 last year, &lt;a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/k397-673e/visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;city records show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sierra has spent much of his career patrolling the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn, but in December 2023 he was transferred to the Auxiliary Police Section, where he oversees auxiliary cops, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.50-a.org/officer/UJ8T" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;50-a.org website&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks NYPD complaints and discipline of cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his successful 2021 campaign for mayor, Eric Adams famously declared himself the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/11/nycs-new-mayor-calls-911-brawl-slides-down-fire-pole-faces-big-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“future of the Democratic Party.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But heading into 2025, that future is in doubt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be a make-or-break year both politically and personally for the indicted Adams, who faces &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/mayor-adams-flashes-thumbs-up-as-he-passes-hecklers-on-return-to-court-resign/"&gt;bombshell federal corruption charges&lt;/a&gt; and a tough re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing a make-or-break year both politically and professionally in 2025, with federal corruption charges and a tough re-election bid among his toughest obstacles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael Nagle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams’ approval ratings sunk to a staggering 26% last month with 69% of New Yorkers saying he should resign – and 80% of fellow Democrats thinking he shouldn’t run for a second term in 2025, &lt;a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-indictment-of-eric-adams-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according a Marist Poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some aren’t counting out the former cop just yet.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“New Yorkers really care about strengthening our economy, lowering crime and having a more livable city, and Mayor Adams has delivered major wins on all those fronts,” said Brooklyn Democratic Party Boss Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at some of the challenges Hizzoner faces in 2025:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal Corruption Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams in September became the first sitting mayor in NYC’s history to be charged with federal crimes, indicted for allegedly taking bribes and illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Adams arriving in Manhattan federal court in November where he is facing public corruption charges. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pled not guilty, vowed to remain in office, and is scheduled to stand trial in April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowded Dem field &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The centrist mayor faces a tough primary in June with a number of prominent leftist Dems, including  Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, Queens Sen. Jessica Ramos and Brooklyn Sen. Zellnor Myrie.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seriously considering running for mayor in 2025.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His biggest challenge could come from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a fellow centrist who resigned in 2021 in the wake of a sexual misconduct scandal &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/28/us-news/cuomo-telling-nyc-powerbrokers-hes-running-for-mayor-if-special-election-is-called-sources/"&gt;but is mounting a political comeback.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC’s migrant crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Adams administration has been stretched thin by more than 226,900 illegal immigrants and other border crossers arriving in the Big Apple since April 2022, with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/07/us-news/nycs-poorest-zip-codes-forced-to-bear-brunt-of-migrant-crisis-confidential-docs-reveal/"&gt;vast majority of them seeking immediate shelter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of mid-December, the city’s migrant-crisis tab reached $6.5 billion as workloads – &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/migrant-crisis-spurred-nearly-3-million-overtime-hours-for-two-nyc-agencies-costing-taxpayers-139m/"&gt;including overtime costs &lt;/a&gt;– soared at various city agencies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The once-glamorous Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan in 2023 was converted into a modern-day version of Ellis Island, where migrants can get hot meals, help with asylum paperwork, medical care and health screenings.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Leonardo Munoz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams has tried to ease some of the burden by enforcing 60- and 30-day shelter-stay limits for families and adults, causing the number of migrants staying in taxpayer-funded city shelters to drop from over 65,000 a year ago to 53,800 as of Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the issue remains a daunting one for him heading into 2025, even with President-elect Donald Trump expected to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/30/us-news/nyc-is-now-home-to-over-58k-criminal-migrants-including-over-1000-gang-members-ice/"&gt;crack down on criminal migrants — including over 58,000 living in NYC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC’s homeless crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p id="block-eeaf63f9-244d-4bb1-8ac1-20946bc02d9e"&gt;There were over 112,700 people living in taxpayer-funded shelters as of Dec. 15, spurred by the ongoing influx of migrants.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="block-eeaf63f9-244d-4bb1-8ac1-20946bc02d9e"&gt;This doesn’t include the more than 4,100 homeless people living unsheltered in the streets and crime-ridden subways — &lt;a href="https://citylimits.org/2024/06/14/citys-yearly-street-homeless-estimate-climbs-to-2nd-highest-number-on-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the city’s highest number of unsheltered homeless people in nearly two decades. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The City Council earlier this month passed Adams’&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/us-news/mayor-adams-key-city-of-yes-initiative-inches-closer-with-5b-pledge-nyc-council-concessions/"&gt; controversial and ambitious “City of Yes” plan&lt;/a&gt; to help address the affordability crisis by building 80,000 new housing units over the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there’s no immediate relief in sight. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/nyc-seeking-14000-hotel-rooms-to-shelter-migrants-through-2025/"&gt;The city is currently contracted with over 150 hotels&lt;/a&gt; that have been converted to homeless shelters serving migrants &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/us-news/121-nyc-hotels-converted-to-migrant-shelters-despite-concerns-of-cost-squeeze-on-tourists/"&gt;instead of serving tourism.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Council&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams and the Council’s far-left majority have been at odds since he took office and members snubbed his pick for Council speaker. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, it’s been a tug-of-war for political power involving vetoes, overrides and dueling bids to put changes to the City Charter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Adams and the Council will be duking it out in court in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Council earlier this month slapped Adams with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/nyc-council-sues-over-mayor-adams-executive-order-flouting-solitary-ban-in-city-jails/"&gt;lawsuit alleging the mayor abused his powers&lt;/a&gt; by issuing an executive order flouting a controversial solitary confinement ban in city jails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The foundation is set for a good working relationship between Trump and Adams, even though Adams will continue to be pressured by Dems and lefty media outlets to shun the Republican.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams in recent weeks has taken a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/03/us-news/mayor-adams-wants-migrants-charged-with-crimes-deported-from-nyc-in-major-shift-cancel-me/"&gt;tougher stance on the city’s sanctuary status&lt;/a&gt;, in line with Trump’s goals of deporting criminal migrants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has said he’d consider pardoning Adams if the mayor is convicted in his pending corruption case. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jovanny Hernandez / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Hizzoner – &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/mayor-adams-wont-rule-out-joining-gop-while-facing-crowded-field-of-dems-in-primary/"&gt;who has not ruled switching back to the Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; — might need Trump’s help if he’s convicted on the pending corruption charges. Earlier this month, Trump said he would consider pardoning Adams, if necessary, because &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/16/us-news/trump-says-hes-considering-pardoning-adams/"&gt;“he was treated pretty unfairly.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gov. Hochul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hochul has the power under a seldom-used state law to remove any mayor in the state from office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The governor has so far declined to oust the embattled Adams – in part because it would alienate prominent &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/04/us-news/hakeem-jeffries-says-eric-adams-should-not-resign-amid-growing-bipartisan-calls-for-nyc-mayor-to-step-down/"&gt;black leaders who’ve rallied behind him &lt;/a&gt;and because Cuomo, her political rival and former boss, is ready to jump into the mayor’s race.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that hasn’t stopped Hochul from pressuring Adams from behind the scenes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/us-news/gov-hochul-told-nyc-mayor-adams-to-clean-house-before-top-aide-resigned-amid-city-hall-legal-chaos-sources/"&gt;clean house&lt;/a&gt; if he wants to keep his job. Several City Hall officials touched by churning federal investigations have either resigned or been forced out since Adams’ indictment — an exodus driven by Hochul, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/hochul-pushing-staff-changes-at-titanic-city-hall-as-she-avoids-ousting-adams-before-nov-5-election-sources/"&gt;sources told The Post in October.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning up the NYPD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/17/opinion/yes-eric-adams-has-lowered-crime-but-not-nearly-enough/"&gt;Overall crime has dropped&lt;/a&gt; under Adams, but the Police Department’s reputation has been gutted by a series of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last week, NYPD Chief of Department &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-former-top-cop-jeffrey-maddreys-years-long-sexual-abuse-was-an-open-secret-sources-say-so-many-more-of-us/"&gt;Jeffrey Maddrey&lt;/a&gt;, a close friend of Adams, abruptly resigned after &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;The Post uncovered explosive allegations&lt;/a&gt; that he demanded sexual favors from a subordinate in exchange for&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt; massive amounts of overtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rikers Island&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Rikers Island jail complex must close by August 2027 and be replaced by four smaller lockups under a 2019 law backed by then-Mayor de Blasio, however — Adams is far behind in implementing the plan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/23/what-a-federal-court-takeover-would-mean-for-rikers-island/"&gt;violence-plagued jail system on Rikers Island&lt;/a&gt; is in serious jeopardy of being put under a federal court’s control – despite objections from the Adams administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams remains far behind in implementing a mandated plan he inherited to shutter Rikers by August 2027 and replace it with four smaller, more humane lockups in each borough but Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More female officers in disgraced top cop Jeffrey Maddrey’s orbit pulled down massive overtime and other perks, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The driver for the former chief of department made an eye-popping $163,414 in OT last year — and resigned days after The Post exposed her boss’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/nypds-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-abruptly-resigns-after-allegedly-demanding-underling-perform-sexual-favors-in-exchange-for-overtime/"&gt;alleged sleazy conduct at police headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, records show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detective Ingrid Sanders was the seventh-highest overtime earner in the department, boosting her total salary last fiscal year to $352,462, records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That put her pay not far behind Lt. Quathisha Epps, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;top earner who made $403,515&lt;/a&gt;, including $204,453 in OT. Epps filed an explosive Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint accusing Maddrey of giving Epps overtime shifts in exchange for sex, The Post revealed in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/he-was-a-predator-nypd-lieutenant-recalls-horrifying-sex-demands-of-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;front-page exclusive&lt;/a&gt; Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Detective Ingrid Sanders (center) made over $350,000 last year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;instagram @nypddcer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Post’s inquiry, Maddrey quit. Sanders was immediately transferred from One Police Plaza to a Queens precinct, and filed for retirement on Dec. 23, The Post found in police documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sanders is a first-grade detective — the top grade — who served in the chief of department’s office since December 2022. She followed Maddrey there from the Patrol Services Bureau. She didn’t return multiple messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey also sought favors for second detective, Ada Reyes, The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps, Maddrey’s personnel manager, told The Post that part of her OT was devoted to taking care of Reyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The overtime that he would give me he would tell me to buy her things like get her some towels and things from Walmart, a microwave, and stuff like that so she doesn’t have to come out of her pocket,” Epps said. “I make the overtime and then I give things to her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Detective Ada Reyes made $55,923 in overtime. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYPD Hispanic Society/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He would have me go apartment hunting with her,” Epps said. “I would be at work and he would tell me to get up and go with her to look for an apartment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Epps claimed, Maddrey told her to rent an apartment that was in her adult children’s names on the Lower East Side to Reyes and her family because they were having trouble finding housing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two sources confirmed the apartment arrangement to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reyes made $42,500 in as a new police officer in 2019 but her pay jumped to $154,405 in 2024, including $55,923 in overtime, city records show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Reyes came to work at NYPD headquarters in 2023, Maddrey told Epps to put her somewhere other than his 13th-floor office, Epps told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;NYPD top earner, Lieutenant Quathisha Epps, accused Maddrey of taking advantage of her fragile financial situation. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook / Quathisha Epps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ingrid [Sanders] and I worked directly for him, and he was very specific not to put Reyes in the office,” Epps said. “He didn’t want her and Ingrid bumping heads.” Reyes was assigned to a domestic violence unit in another part of the building, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reyes didn’t return multiple phone and text messages seeking comment. Nobody was at the apartment when The Post visited. A neighbor confirmed she and her husband lived there after looking at a photograph of her.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Epps’ alleged overtime agreement with Maddrey began because she was having financial problems and her home was being foreclosed on, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey, the highest ranking uniformed cop on the force, demanded “unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities” from Epps, between June 2023 and Dec. 16, 2024, the EEOC complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey would send her text messages telling her to close her door and “strip for me right now.” She would take video and send it to him, she told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps claimed she had sex with Maddrey between eight and 10 times on the couch in his inner office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first time, Maddrey told her he dreamed of having anal sex with her and then violently pulled her pants down and did so despite her repeatedly telling him to “stop,” she told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think he’s a predator,” Epps said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a Friday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, Maddrey’s lawyer, Lambros Lambrau, called Epps a “self-professed swinger” who is under investigation for “stealing time and putting in for overtime she never worked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now Lieutenant Epps got caught with her hands in the cookie jar and is trying to deflect her own wrongdoing by making these allegations against Chief Maddrey,” Lambrou said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, the truth is Lieutenant Epps had a consensual adult relationship, albeit for a short time with Jeff,” he said, adding they have a ton of evidence including “X rated and racy videos and photographs from Lieutenant Epps.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey didn’t speak during the press conference and ignored questions yelled at him from the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators searched a top floor of NYPD headquarters last week, seeking evidence in the tawdry sex-for-overtime scandal exposed by The Post, sources said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleuths performed a crime scene analysis in the 13th-floor office of recently ousted Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey at One Police Plaza, where he allegedly preyed on Lt. Quathisha Epps and demanded sexual favors from her in exchange for green-lighting her staggering overtime pay, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigators likely were looking for evidence of sexual abuse, a potential felony, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ex-Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey allegedly preyed on Lt. Quathisha Epps and demanded sexual favors from her in exchange for green-lighting her staggering overtime pay, a source said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epps alleged in an Equal Opportunity Complaint that Maddrey, the Force’s top uniformed cop, had sex with her eight to 10 times in his office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She’s alleging it was coerced. That’s non-consensual,” an ex-NYPD official said of a possible criminal charge in the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; the allegations on Friday, insisting the ex-NYPD honcho had a “consensual” relationship with Epps, and that he was weighing a civil suit against her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epps previously told The Post Maddrey first propositioned her in June 2023, telling his underling he wanted to have anal sex with her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then allegedly bent her over the couch in his office and violently pulled down her pants before reaching in a locker to pull out a bottle of KY-Jelly, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then had sex with her even after she said “stop,” Epps alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police officer close to Maddrey recently was seen&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;going into the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/ex-nypd-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey-kicked-out-by-wife-after-tawdry-sex-for-ot-scandal-expose-sources/"&gt;disgraced&lt;/a&gt; ex-chief’s office and removing unknown items after The Post reached out to the NYPD for comment on Epps’ allegation last week, a second police source said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former stock car racer and self-proclaimed paranormal investigator has posted footage to YouTube he said shows drones flying off the New Jersey coast in “deliberate formations” over the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CJ Faison, a Delaware YouTuber with 600,000 subscribers, rented himself a boat, grabbed his night vision video camera, and ventured from the Pine Barrens to the ocean 26 miles east.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Faison claimed in the 45-minute video to be “doing something no YouTuber or news outlet has done.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;CJ Faison rented a boat to try to track down some drones. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He teased in the footage “we think we uncovered the truth” about the recent sightings of mysterious unmanned aircraft hovering over the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sightings of unidentified drones emitting strange light patterns started back in mid-November, and reached a fever pitch around Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The debate over what the drones actually are and who is controlling them rages on, with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/22/opinion/nj-drone-saga-shows-were-fed-up-with-government-gaslighting/"&gt;the feds providing little more&lt;/a&gt; than assurances they pose no threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Like most of the purported drone footage online, Faison’s footage from the rented boat fails to provide clear images of what he claimed were drones that emerged from the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A series of blinking lights was caught by Faison’s camera. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He noted the lights blinked in a pattern similar to the lights of commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He said drones he saw moved erratically and very quickly. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Faison walked away with more questions than answers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re blending in,” the YouTuber said. “Hidden in plain sight!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the alleged drones Faison filmed moved quickly, darting across the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s wild,” he proclaimed. “It’s eerie.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is only the beginning,” Faison further warned. “I have so many questions. What’s launching these drones? How are they staying airborne for hours? What’s their energy source? And why here? Why New Jersey?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Faison headed out at dusk to locate the mysterious aircraft. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Youtube/CJ Faison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Jersey officials &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/mystery-nj-drone-sightings-drop-after-early-december-surge/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; the number of sightings had dropped, with very little activity reported around Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drop-off follows FAA-imposed restrictions on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/faa-bans-drone-use-over-critical-infastrcutre-locations-in-new-york-city/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/faa-bans-drones-over-parts-of-new-jersey-threatens-deadly-force-for-imminent-security-threat/"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; airspace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FBI said it has investigated approximately 5,000 of the various reports it received from the public, with about 100 deemed credible. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/mystery-nj-drone-sightings-drop-after-early-december-surge/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final glittering crystal triangles that make up the&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/times-squares-decade-old-midnight-moment-is-having-a-social-media-moment/"&gt; Times Square New Year’s Eve ball &lt;/a&gt;were installed Friday — revealing the new facade of the iconic geometric dome that will ring in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapper Pitbull carefully lodged the last triangle in its place at the unveiling, which marked the first time in a decade that all 2,688 pieces on the ball were replaced at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be the last time the 11,875-pound pound ball will make its descent atop One Times Square — the massive structure will be retired following this year’s New Year’s Eve party, along with its &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/video/new-years-eve-2025-numerals-arrive-in-times-square/"&gt;accompanying countdown numerals&lt;/a&gt;, and displayed in a museum planned for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;All 2,688 crystal triangles were replaced for the 2025 ball drop. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pitbull held the honor of placing the final triangle on the ball. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Miller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t fret: a new ball and numerals will be raised for next year’s celebration.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In the weeks before the unveiling, lucky visitors had the chance to install the new 2025 crystals on the ball themselves — and take home one of the old triangles that were being replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2,688 crystal triangles vary in size, and range in length from 4 3/4 inches to 5 3/4 inches per side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new crystals showcase two special patterns: the 2025 design features long linear cuts with a circle near the top representing the 139′ pole and the iconic building famous for the ball drop celebration as an ode to One Times Square’s legacy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The old crystal triangles were given out to lucky New Yorkers earlier this month. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The ball and its numerals will be retired and displayed in an upcoming museum planned for 2025. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ever Crystal design highlights the future to come and consists of three pairs of interlocking rings surrounded by diamond-shaped facets that provide the setting for the letter E, symbolizing unity and enduring love.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/28/us-news/woman-who-wrote-new-years-wish-on-times-square-confetti-in-nyc-reveals-dream-came-true/"&gt;The New Year’s Eve ball &lt;/a&gt;was first dropped in Times Square in 1907 and was much smaller than the behemoth unveiled Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 700-pound, 5-foot diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Six newer versions of the ball have been featured in the century-plus since that first celebration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Post Wires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arby’s may have “the meat,” but some customers have a beef.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Queens woman is accusing the fast food joint of downsizing its French fries and drinks without lowering prices or alerting customers in a class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Arby’s deceptively continues to sell its fries and beverages in smaller sizes which are now substantially smaller than the old sizes,” the suit, filed in Queens County Supreme Court, alleges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Queens woman is suing Arby’s in a class action suit for downsizing its portions of French fries and drinks without adjusting prices or notifying customers. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The class action suit alleges Arby’s eliminated the kids portion of fries and made that the new “small.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF QUEENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The increase in prices may never be noticed by Arby’s purchasers, who may be left only with a strange feeling, short of satiety, even though this was due to … downsizing,” it continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By comparing nutritional facts for its different portions of fries, lawyers representing Melissa Nelson, of Ridgewood, found that Arby’s phased out its kids’ sized fries, made that portion the new small, the prior small the new medium, and the old medium the new large.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The company allegedly made the switch with its drinks, too, and did so “without any corresponding reduction in price … or disclosure to its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suit found that the small order of fries has the same amount of calories and protein as the old “kids” size. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF QUEENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crinkle fries at Arby’s now cost $3.74 for a small, $4.49 for a medium, and $4.99 for a large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a recent fast food run by The Post found all three sizes had nearly the same amount of fries inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move comes amid increasing instances of “shrinkflation,” when companies reduce quantities — often without changing package size — and only sometimes lower prices, and “greedflation,” when companies charge more for less in the face of rising inflation, the suit argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Customers relied on Arby’s “consistent sizes” at “relatively consistent prices” and have been misled into forking over more for less, according to the lawsuit. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A federal push to make “shrinkflation” illegal, the Shrinkflation Prevention Act, would prohibit downsizing without transparency and proportionate reductions in prices, and would prevent consumers from getting “shortchanged,” it notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/france-orders-retailers-display-shrinkflation-2024-04-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;countries, including France&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea, and Hungary have enacted laws that require clear notices that a product has been downsized without a corresponding reduction in price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Social media users got wise to Arby’s moves, too, the lawyers found, with one even claiming that an employee said, “Arby’s corporate is downsizing all the size portions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arby’s “deceptively” continues to sell its fries and beverages in smaller sizes which are now substantially smaller than the old sizes, the suit charges. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers like Nelson have come to rely on Arby’s “consistent sizes” at “relatively consistent prices over time” and have been misled into forking over more for less, a violation of business law, the suit, which seeks unspecified damages, argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson seeks to represent any New Yorkers who purchased French fries and beverages at Arby’s in the state before the sizes were adjusted downwards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arby’s did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch ousted dozens of NYPD bosses in a shocking Saturday purge, beginning with the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau, a week after The Post revealed that top cop &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/he-was-a-predator-nypd-lieutenant-recalls-horrifying-sex-demands-of-top-cop-jeffrey-maddrey/"&gt;Jeffrey Maddrey was allegedly trading overtime for sex&lt;/a&gt; at police headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deputy Chief Chris Morello, the No. 2 boss at the famed watchdog bureau whose mission is to weed out bad cops, was removed from his post, paperwork obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes a week after IAB’s top boss, Chief of Internal Affairs Miguel Iglesias, was ejected the day of the Dec. 21 expose in The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspector Joseph Profeta, who was head of IAB’s Group 1, was booted Saturday to Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, the documents show. The group investigates allegations regarding NYPD brass with the rank of captain or above. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tisch means business,” a high-ranking source said. “She’s cleaning up the mess and putting the department back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The moves were made because of a “lack of oversight” by IAB, the source said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deputy Chief Chris Morello was removed from his post, paperwork obtained by The Post shows. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chris Morello/Linkedin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inspector Michael Ricciardi of IAB Special Ops was also ousted and sent to Patrol Borough Manhattan North, the orders show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another dozen IAB bosses, ranging from lieutenants to sergeants, were sent packing to far-flung precincts across the city, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six members of Maddrey’s office — five detectives and one police officer — were also booted in the bloodletting, most of them sent to walk the beat in public housing, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sweeping changes come after The Post revealed in a Sunday front-page story that Chief of Department Maddrey was allegedly granting &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/us-news/nypd-lt-quathisha-epps-wants-suspension-lifted-following-maddrey-sexual-abuse-claims/"&gt;overtime for sex to Lt. Quathisha Epps&lt;/a&gt;, who raked in a total of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/us-news/nypds-400k-a-year-top-earner-is-retiring-early-as-astronomical-overtime-pay-is-investigated-sources/"&gt;more than $400,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to show that you are genuinely trying to change the face of the department and get rid of all of Maddrey’s cronies, this is the best way to do it,” a police officer with more than 20 years on the job said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Tisch ordered 500 officers who had been “improperly transferred” to go back to their regular assignments, an internal police memo obtained by The Post shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The practice was known as “telephone message transfers” and led to a lack of boots on the ground in some areas and therefore slower response times, the Dec. 9 memo stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Post revealed that top cop Jeffrey Maddrey was allegedly trading overtime for sex at police headquarters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Epps claimed in graphic detail in an exclusive interview with The Post that Maddrey, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the NYPD, coerced her to have sex in his office between eight and 10 times, in exchange for the massive overtime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her lawyer, Eric Sanders, filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, a precursor to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Former NYPD Chief Jeffrey Maddrey with his lawyer Lambros Lambrou in Manhattan on Dec. 26. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maddrey abruptly retired the day of The Post report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ex-nypd-chief-jeffrey-maddreys-lawyer-goes-on-defense-at-press-conference/"&gt;claimed through his lawyer&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that he had a “consensual, adult relationship” with Epps, but denied her accusation of “coercion.” The lawyer, Lambros Lambrou, said Maddrey had no authority to sign off on overtime pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Epps’ attorney told The Post, “This clown is a f–king disgrace. We have a treasure trove of digital data that will hopefully bring this degenerate to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/allan-goldman/?sh=68d5826a7737" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;real estate billionaire’s son &lt;/a&gt;should be barred from getting a share of his father’s fortune  — because he lied to try to cut his dad’s lover out of the will, she argued in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natalia Vostrikova insisted in new filings that Steven Gurney-Goldman had gone against his wealthy dad Allan’s wishes when he made gruesome allegations she neglected the ailing man, who died alone in Russia in January 2022 at age 78.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gurney-Goldman “now must face the consequences,” Vostrikova said in her Nassau County Supreme Court filing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Natalia Vostrikova (right) insisted in new filings that Steven Gurney-Goldman had gone against his wealthy dad Allan’s (center) wishes when he made gruesome allegations she neglected the ailing man. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Allan Goldman, who struggled with Parkinson’s disease for years, was the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/10/metro/nyc-real-estate-empire-a-real-life-succession-battle-lawsuit/"&gt;son of real estate tycoon Sol Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, who built a Manhattan real estate empire that once included the Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allan was in a “severely deteriorated” state with multiple organ failures and bedsores following a months-long visit to Russia with Vostrikova when he died, Gurney-Goldman claimed in a 2022 lawsuit filed against Vostrikova.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Vostrikova, the older man’s lover and caretaker who also served as the family nanny decades earlier, allegedly left Allan Goldman alone in a five-star hotel in Moscow while she lived a luxe life on his dime, Gurney-Goldman &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/us-news/longtime-caretaker-jealously-manipulated-nyc-billionaire-allan-goldman-before-letting-him-die-alone-in-russia-so-she-could-pocket-2m-inheritance-suit/"&gt;contended in the legal filing. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The son claimed Vostrikova neglected his dad in a bid to hasten his death — and collect her $2 million inheritance sooner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vostrikova, who also served as the family nanny decades earlier, allegedly left Allan Goldman alone in a five-star hotel in Moscow while she lived a luxe life on his dime, Gurney-Goldman contended in the legal filing.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Joe Ruback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vostrikova — who claims Russian authorities cleared her of any wrongdoing in Allan’s death — wants the whole case tossed out of court. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not only that they were in love, they were a couple. He cared for her and she cared for him,” said her lawyer Kian Khatibi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldman left an estate worth at least $250 million, court records show, and had a 25% interest in his father’s company, Solil Management, which is worth an estimated $12 billion,&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/goldman-family/#:~:text=Sol's%20daughter%20Jane%20heads%20up,worth%20an%20estimated%20%2412%20billion." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; according to Forbes.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goldman left an estate worth at least $250 million, court records show, and had a 25% interest in his father’s company, Solil Management, which is worth an estimated $12 billion, according to Forbes.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by The New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Gurney-Goldman contended that Vostrikova was not cleared of wrongdoing and that Russian authorities refused to investigate the matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the executor of his father’s will, Mr. Gurney-Goldman is upholding his fiduciary duty by bringing a wrongful death action against the woman whom we’ve alleged is responsible for his father’s untimely death,” attorney Daniel Noble said. “Ms. Vostrikova’s claim that Mr. Gurney-Goldman should be disinherited as a result is erroneous and meritless.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city Department of Education is so intent on firing a disabled teacher that it went to court two days before Christmas to terminate him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abraham Freud, who worked as a DOE special-ed teacher for 24 years, has become disabled himself, suffering from scoliosis and arthritis, making it impossible for him to physically handle a classroom of autistic students, he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m scared to lose my job and health benefits,” said Freud, 46, a father of four. “Just because I’m disabled doesn’t mean I’m garbage and should be thrown away.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Abraham Freud, a 46-year-old father of four, is begging the DOE to give him a less strenuous assignment: “I’m not useless!” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a bid to terminate special-ed teacher Abraham Freud, the city DOE filed a motion in court two days before Christmas. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing fight, the DOE filed a motion in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Dec. 23 asking a judge to lift an order blocking it from firing Freud, citing a “misuse of taxpayer funds” to continue paying his salary after he exhausted his sick days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Freud’s lawyer, Christina Martinez, called it not only “heartless” but a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This case shines a light on the DOE’s disregard for disabled employees and their legal rights,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Freud is physically unable to continue teaching severely disabled students at PS. K369, the Coy L. Cox school, at this site in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J.C. Rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since November, Freud has been unable to teach at PS K369 in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, a K-to-12 school for kids with severe disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has repeatedly applied to work as an attendance teacher, which involves making phone calls and  visiting homes, but learned the DOE had blacklisted his file with a “problem code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “I never got back one response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DOE said it could not answer questions on the case Friday because officials are off,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;torching death of a woman&lt;/a&gt; sleeping on a Brooklyn train has stirred up painful memories for a still- grieving mother — and left her outraged that the MTA hasn’t learned its lesson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When news of the shocking subway killing reached her in Arizona, Vicki Goble, 73, immediately thought about her son, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/man-36-killed-at-least-16-others-injured-in-harlem-subway-fire-report/"&gt;Garrett Goble&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2020 when someone started a fire on a No. 2 train he was operating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For me, there were shades of remembering my son and what he went through working for the MTA,” Goble told The Post Friday. “I just can’t imagine there were people on the train that just watched this guy do this, and did nothing to try to stop him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If an MTA worker had easier access to an extinguisher, Sunday’s victim could have been saved. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by the Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Garrett Goble pictured with his wife, Delilah, and their two boys.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goble helped over a dozen people escape to safety when someone started a fire on a No. 2 train he was operating.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Garret Goble, 36, &lt;span&gt;a married father &lt;/span&gt;of two sons, had just started his shift as a motorman on March 27, 2020, when a career criminal loaded a trash-filled shopping cart onto the 2 Train — and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/cops-arrest-alleged-arsonist-who-killed-mta-conductor-in-march/"&gt;set it ablaze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A six-year MTA veteran, Garrett Goble navigated the blazing train through the blackened subway tunnels to a Harlem station, where &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/28/hero-mta-worker-killed-in-harlem-subway-fire-was-dedicated-dad/"&gt;the hero dad&lt;/a&gt; helped evacuate more than a dozen passengers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He returned for his bag but died from smoke inhalation, his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The pain and memory of her son’s death forced Vicki Goble to leave Brooklyn’s Flatlands neighborhood in 2022 for Arizona, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They did nothing,” Vicki Goble said of the MTA, which still does not provide MTA workers with fire extinguishers in their cabins — something she and Garrett Goble’s wife, Delilah, have been calling on the agency to do since his death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m mad, because it’s like they forgot about my son,” Vicki Goble said. “It’s a shame that more things haven’t been done to improve fire safety on the subways, for the workers and the riders. They wanna do all this modernization of the stations, but without the workers and people who use it, you won’t have a subway system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A photo shows the inside of the train that Goble died in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They could at least put a fire extinguisher in the cabins of the conductors. That might give people a fighting chance to put out a fire. The people that are in power tend to forget where they came from.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MTA worker operating last weekend’s train may have been able “to save that woman if they had acted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman killed in last week’s subway car fire has &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/nyc-may-rely-on-dental-records-to-id-mystery-woman-torched-to-death-on-subway-as-activists-say-she-was-likely-homeless/"&gt;only been described as homeless.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guatemalan migrant &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/us-news/critics-say-bystanders-stood-by-while-illegal-migrant-burned-woman-to-death-on-nyc-subway-daniel-penny-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Zapeta-Calil&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested for the heinous murder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am very disappointed,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The alleged arsonist Sebastian Zapeta-Calil was caught on video watching the woman burn alive.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Avinger, the man who started the 2020 fire, has yet to stand trial on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/cops-arrest-alleged-arsonist-who-killed-mta-conductor-in-march/"&gt;murder and arson charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An MTA spokesperson said fire extinguishers are only “kept along the tracks and within the booths at stations” — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/us-news/public-cant-access-fire-extinguishers-in-nyc-subways/"&gt;both areas the public cannot access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The MTA isn’t doing anything, especially with fire safety,” Vicki Goble said. “The system is so antiquated for a city this size, this great and this important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk County District Attorney’s office is probing allegations of animal neglect at the taxpayer-funded Holtsville Ecology Center in Long Island, following The Post’s reporting on claims &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/us-news/honey-the-bear-blasted-with-high-pressure-hose-at-troubled-holtsville-ecology-center-video/"&gt;its staff mistreated a 27-year-old bear named Honey&lt;/a&gt; before she was euthanized last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were asked to look into it so we will,” Tierney told The Post, declining to discuss details.&lt;/p&gt;

Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The refuge, which is licensed by the state Department of Environmental Conservation and curiously run by the town’s Highway Department, will be under “a lot more oversight now” by the town board members and the supervisor’s staff, Panico vowed. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DEC is conducting its own investigation and previously said it has interviewed some of the eight former workers who shared their concerns over the animals’ treatment with the advocacy group Humane Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The 3.5-acre refuge, which opened in 1974 on top of a former landfill and is free to the public, has roughly 100 sick or injured animals in its care that cannot survive in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The center came under fire in recent weeks after Honey, its star attraction, lost the use of the rear part of her body after she suffered a stroke and was euthanized on Nov. 22.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy gave new meaning to the slogan “Gottahava Wawa.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police in East Windsor, N.J., arrested a 24-year-old man on Dec. 23, and charged him with misusing the town’s 911 system for allegedly calling emergency dispatchers a total of 17 times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than take an Uber, Adam Vaughn allegedly wanted the town cops to personally shuttle him back and forth to the nearest Wawa — the popular convenience store — in neighboring Hightstown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, East Windsor police personally visited Vaughn at the Windsor Hotel where he was staying, and warned him to stop making the calls.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning came after Vaughn’s first few attempts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling 911, police informed him, was for emergencies only.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the warning went in one ear and out the other — as Vaughn allegedly kept peppering 911 with calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was ultimately placed in handcuffs after making his 17th plea for a police escort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to misusing 911, Vaughn received a criminal summons for obstruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some magic in the air in Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last December, Ana Cecy Malacara visited New York City for the first time and shared with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/23/metro/tourists-new-yorkers-flock-to-times-square-wishing-wall/"&gt;The Post &lt;/a&gt;at the &lt;a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/nye-wishing-wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Year’s Eve Wishing Wall&lt;/a&gt; her secret wish for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later she returned to her native Mexico. “After I was back, I was feeling strange,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I told my husband I need to get checked because I was having a lot of nausea. We thought it was a cold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, her dream written on a piece of Times Square confetti had come true — Ana was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Malacara visited the Wishing Wall in Dec. 2023 and wrote her dream for a new baby on a piece of confetti.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Helayne Seidman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Grecia, whose name means Grace in English, was born on Aug. 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were trying for three or four months and we couldn’t conceive yet,” said Ana, 29, who shares another daughter, 3 year-old Lucia, with her now-husband, Victor Serrano, 31, who proposed to her during the NYC trip. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Grecia Serrano was born on Aug. 15, 2024. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ana Cecy Malacara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a powerful thing that confetti.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, on New Year’s Eve, another 3,000 pounds of confetti will be tossed from the rooftops of Times Square after the ball drops at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fluttering spectacle of 25 million pieces of shredded paper will be broadcast on “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest.” Ana says her family will be watching, as always.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The couple, pictured here with their daughters Lucia, 3, and Grecia, 4 months, got married on Dec. 21.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ana Cecy Malacara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wishing Wall, located on Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets, opened on Dec. 2. The Times Square Alliance, which runs it, said it has already collected 100,000 wishes. Last year, 150 countries were represented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ana, a General Motors engineer, says she will be back one day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I fell in love with New York, and my daughter, Lucia, she keeps telling me, ‘I want to go to New York.'” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/14/us-news/nearly-1k-drone-sightings-reported-in-nj-in-less-than-a-month/"&gt;drone activity over New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; has taken a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/us-news/former-defense-official-makes-earth-shattering-revelation-as-mystery-drones-cause-concern/"&gt;reported drone sightings&lt;/a&gt; dropped off considerably, officials in Ocean County said this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific numbers were not released, but Ocean County Sheriff Michael G. Mastronardy confirmed fewer sightings of the unmanned aircraft being called in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drones have been invading the area since mid-November. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;@MendhamMike/Storyful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some sightings continue, with social media footage from Somerset, Ocean and Bergen counties capturing more alleged drone activity in the sky above the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete answers from federal officials concerning what the drones are, where they are from and their purpose remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastronardy, who at one point &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/14/us-news/sophisticated-drones-over-nj-could-be-part-of-iran-china-alliance-pol/"&gt;launched his own drone&lt;/a&gt; to try to track the mysterious aircraft, said his office took more reports about drone sightings on Dec. 8 and 9 than any other day since they started in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dropoff follows FAA-imposed restrictions on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/us-news/faa-bans-drone-use-over-critical-infastrcutre-locations-in-new-york-city/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/us-news/faa-bans-drones-over-parts-of-new-jersey-threatens-deadly-force-for-imminent-security-threat/"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; airspace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Monmouth County was a hotbed for drone sightings. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/Monmouth County Sheriff's Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FBI said it has investigated approximately 5,000 of the various reports it received from the public, with about 100 deemed credible. Federal officials maintain the drones pose no threat to national security or the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYPD’s hot-headed Deputy Commissioner of Public Information —  who once called a New York Post reporter a “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/fbi-raids-home-of-nypd-commish-edward-caban-other-close-eric-adams-allies/"&gt;f–king scumbag&lt;/a&gt;” — was demoted this week, police sources said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tarik Sheppard, a 21-year veteran of the NYPD, will be an assistant chief and commanding officer at the Interagency Operations Division as of Dec. 26, NYPD paperwork shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s definitely a downward move but a soft landing,” a police source said of Sheppard, a friend of Mayor Adams.  &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sheppard once called a New York Post reporter a “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/fbi-raids-home-of-nypd-commish-edward-caban-other-close-eric-adams-allies/"&gt;f–king scumbag&lt;/a&gt;” while reporting on the raids against former NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear exactly why he was booted from his post, but Sheppard, 48, got into a kerfuffle with then-acting Police Commissioner Tom Donlon at the NYC Marathon in November and has had run-ins with the media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sheppard, who was once commander of the 28th Precinct in Harlem, was appointed DCPI by former Police Commissioner Edward Caban in August 2023 and brought a cadre of his own people with him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He expanded the office from about 40 employees to 86. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of them are now being transferred out of the office too, police sources said.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In one of his controversial moves, Sheppard moved reporters who cover the NYPD and worked for decades in a second-floor warren of offices nicknamed “The Shack” to a modular building outside police headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed it was to make more room for “ethnic media,” but the space is usually utilized by the same handful of journalists who previously worked inside the main building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sheppard called a Post City Hall reporter a “f–king scumbag” after the reporter reached out to Chief of Patrol John Chell for comment about a federal investigation of city officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City’s biggest overtime hogs for a second straight year are mostly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/18/metro/migrant-crisis-sees-jaw-dropping-overtime-hours-for-nyc-agencies/"&gt;rank-and-file workers responsible for tackling the Big Apple’s $6 billion-plus migrant crisis, &lt;/a&gt;The Post has learned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one of the 100 city employees who racked up the most OT during the fiscal year ending June 30 work at the Departments of Social Services and Homeless Services, and their duties include assisting migrants, an &lt;a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/widgets/k397-673e?mobile_redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;examination of city payroll records shows.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each worker accumulated at least 1,851 hours in extra pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rank-and-file workers responsible for tackling the Big Apple’s $6 billion-plus migrant crisis predominantly clocked the most overtime hours of any city workers.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;J. Messerschmidt for NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kashwayne Burnett, a DSS bookkeeper, clocked 3,303 overtime hours — the most of any city worker.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading the way was Kashwayne Burnett, a DSS bookkeeper who worked 3,303 hours of overtime in the agency’s Manhattan office. That comes to roughly 14 hours a day, seven days a week. The 10-year veteran’s $164,760 in overtime pay more than tripled his $60,445 base salary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bardhan Pijush, a DSS caseworker, was second with 3,137 extra hours, followed by Gavin McAuley, a DHS housekeeper who clocked 2,664 hours of OT.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In the previous fiscal year, 47 employees at both departments were among the 100 who worked the most OT, a huge leap from fiscal 2022 when only three workers made the list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The migrant crisis “has been a major drain” on all municipal resources, but the DSS and DHS’s overtime hours and payouts are “absolutely staggering,” City Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We simply can’t continue down this path,” he said. “It has to end, and taxpayers are sick of it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DSS and DHS staffers have been especially stretched thin by the more than 226,900 asylum seekers and other border crossers who’ve reached the Big Apple since April 2022 – and many have seen their workloads soar because of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Friday the city’s migrant-crisis tab was $6.5 billion, and 53,800 migrants were still in city care at taxpayer-funded shelters as of Dec. 15, city officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;DSS and DHS workers racked up 2,959,114 hours of overtime combined, totaling more than $139.4 million in payouts.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both agencies in fiscal 2024 racked up a jaw-dropping 2,959,114 hours of overtime combined, totaling more than $139.4 million in payouts, records show.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a staggering 67% increase from the 1,770,634 overtime hours worked by DSS and DHS staffers in fiscal 2021, which predated the migrant crisis, while agencies’ workers earnings for extra shifts have nearly doubled since then, from $72.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also a 10% increase from fiscal 2023, when the agencies’ staff &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/18/metro/migrant-crisis-sees-jaw-dropping-overtime-hours-for-nyc-agencies/"&gt;combined to rack up 2,690,659 additional hours, totaling $123.1 million in overtime earnings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York taxpayers are still on the hook for picking up the tab for the Biden administration’s border blunders, warned Ken Girardin, director of research for the nonprofit think tank Empire Center for Public Policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The bill is still running — we’re going to see bills like this for at least another year,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the surge in OT to help migrants, DSS spokesperson Neha Sharma said the agency is “extremely grateful” to its staffers who, “despite truly unprecedented challenges, have stepped up and worked long hours to provide necessary support for our newest arrivals and long-term New Yorkers in need.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is because of our remarkable staff that the City of New York can continue to do more than any other level of government to support asylum seekers while providing robust services and support to vulnerable New Yorkers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burnett and Pijush did not return messages. McAuley could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
