&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;De’Ovryion Elijha Ray, 23, was ordered held without bail on Thursday for the “execution style” killing of his ex-girlfriend, Dashanna Donovan. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray pleaded not guilty to the “execution style” killing of Donovan, 21, and was ordered held without bail by Queens Supreme Court Justice Ushir Pandit-Durant, according to prosecutors and court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged killer, who hails from Simpsonville, showed “no remorse” during the court hearing, Donovan’s mother, Helena Hypolite, who was inside the courtroom, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He showed no remorse, nothing. It just had me boiling, profusely angry,” Hypolite said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grieving mother said Ray exchanged fervent glances with her throughout the proceeding, and nodded to her when she stood up after he was brought into the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When they brought him in, I stood up and he looked at me and nodded. When they were taking him out, he looked at me and nodded again. To me, it’s like he was saying, ‘Now what?” Hypolite said..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Donovan’s mother, Helena Hypolite, said Ray showed “no remorse” for allegedly killing her daughter while in the courtroom for his arraignment.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Brigitte Stelzer/copyphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was full of rage. My blood was boiling,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray was first arrested in South Carolina on Oct. 7 and extradited to New York to face murder charges, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accused murderer was tight-lipped and avoided eye contact as cops escorted him out of the 115th precinct in navy pants, red sneakers, a grey quarter-cip sweatshirt, and handcuffs before his arraignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray allegedly traveled by bus from Virginia Beach, Virginia to New York City on the day of Donovan’s murder. He then took a subway from Manhattan to Queens and approached Donovan’s East Elmhurst home on 96th Street by roughly 9 p.m., according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donovan was in her backyard when a motion light turned on in the alleyway. She looked down the alleyway and appeared to recognize the person walking toward her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old — who moved to the Big Apple just six months before to escape an abusive relationship with Ray — then screamed and ran into her apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray ran around the corner of the house while wielding a gun and pointed it in the direction of Donovan as he entered the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police found her lying near the doorframe of her bathroom with gunshot wounds to her head and torso. She was pronounced dead at the scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gunning down Donovan, Ray fled to Virginia Beach that same night, officials alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was a calculated, cold-blooded murder of a young woman who was running for her life when she was gunned down,” DA Katz said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As alleged, the defendant traveled to New York, killed the victim and fled the state mere hours after the murder in a tragic case of domestic violence,” Katz added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Brooklyn scammers pleaded guilty on Thursday &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/us-news/scammers-ripped-off-nys-controversial-medicaid-homecare-program-for-68m-feds/"&gt;to defrauding a whopping $68 million from the state’s controversial Medicaid home care program&lt;/a&gt; by paying health care kickbacks for services they didn’t provide at three Big Apple businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manal Wasef and Elaine Antao, both 46, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud for referring Medicaid recipients to two Brooklyn social adult day cares and a home health company in exchange for illegal kickbacks and bribes,&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-individuals-plead-guilty-68m-adult-day-care-fraud-scheme" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; the US Department of Justice announced &lt;/a&gt;on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between October 2017 and July 2024, Wasef and Antao worked as marketers and recruiters for Happy Family Social Adult Day Care Center Inc. and Family Social Adult Day Care Center Inc., as well as Responsible Care Staffing Inc., a home health care fiscal intermediary, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair paid illegal kickbacks and bribes to the Medicaid recipients for social adult day care services and home health care services at the locales — billing them to Medicaid despite never providing them, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasef and Antao also used multiple business entities to launder the fraud proceeds and generate cash for paying the kickbacks and bribes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their guilty plea, the fraudsters agreed to fork over approximately $1 million, officials added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The defendants were large-scale recruiters who bribed patients with laundered cash and billed Medicaid over $68 million for services that were not provided,” Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s guilty pleas demonstrate the Department’s longstanding commitment to rooting out fraud in government health care programs by aggressively prosecuting those who steal from taxpayer-funded programs,” Duva said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasef and Antao are two of eight people initially accused of mounting the yearslong kickback and bribery scheme to defraud the state program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners Zakia Khan and Ahsan Ijaz, as well as Oasmneah Hamdi, Ansir Abassi, and Amran Hashmi, were among those charged. Wasef and Antao are the sixth and seventh scammers to plead guilty in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair ripped off the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP), which allows those with minimal healthcare experience to care for their elderly or disabled relatives and friends,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/14/us-news/how-nys-6-billion-cdpap-medicaid-program-has-been-abused-overused-for-years/"&gt; The Post previously revealed. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of “middleman” firms essentially work as payroll agents between the caregivers and Medicaid, with minimal oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These defendants placed profit over people and public well-being and stole $68 million in welfare funds meant for those who need it most,”  Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations New York said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their guilty pleas today reflect that they knew exactly what crimes they were committing — they were cheating the system and, in turn, hurting vulnerable Americans,” Patel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I commend HSI New York and our law enforcement partners for their unrelenting focus on dismantling and disrupting financial fraud schemes that exploit the American public and hurt our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antao is slated to be sentenced on May 20, and Wasef on May 27. They each face a maximum of 10 years behind bars, federal authorities said. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/us-news/scammers-ripped-off-nys-controversial-medicaid-homecare-program-for-68m-feds/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Ortiz is Mr. 1,000 at Hewlett High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standout senior point guard is the eighth player in program history to tally 1,000 career points — but he’s not satisfied yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m probably around 1,150 right now, and the goal is 1,450,” the 17-year-old told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Justin Ortiz recently scored his 1,000th career point for the Hewlett boys basketball team.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maxx Star/Hewlett Athletics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because the school record here is 1,445.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortiz has breathed basketball ever since he was a little kid, when it became a rite of passage for all the neighborhood boys to play pickup games on the hoop in front of his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Playing with those guys, it kind of prepared me for this moment,” Ortiz said of his two older brothers and kids twice his age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That moment came in late December with a 73-48 win over the High School for Law Enforcement and Public Safety, when Ortiz overshadowed his own lifetime achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Going into halftime, and I shot from half court fading away, and it went in — of course, for 999.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that he’s complaining about the record-setting 3-pointer that sank shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation Ortiz has to be the highest-scoring Bulldog ever to take the court comes during an especially emotional season for the whole squad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortiz’s assistant coach, Jonathon Welsh, is fighting a family battle as his&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/11/us-news/long-island-school-rallies-for-hoops-coachs-2-year-old-daughter-with-rare-illness-that-attacks-organs/"&gt; 2-year-old daughter is enduring a genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; that puts her at risk of organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recently held a sold-out tournament, The Rowyn Grace Classic, in honor of the tough little girl, and it hit the star harder than most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s a father figure to me. … He’s someone that I look up to. He’s family — when one of ours is struggling, we’re going to struggle with him,” the point guard added of Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortiz’s achievements on the court now — which all the neighborhood guys who’ve moved away or gone off to college diligently keep tabs on — bring him closer to his late father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in net is no stretch for Sophie Marino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star of Long Beach’s gymnastics squad is doing a spectacular split this winter — simultaneously playing goalie for the 12-win Marines boys varsity hockey team that’s on fire in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gymnastics taught me strength, endurance, and being fearless,” Marino told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span data-slideshow-modal="count"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goalie Sophie Marino makes a save during Long Beach High School boys varsity team practice in Long Beach, N.Y. on Jan. 12, 2026. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Heather Khalifa for the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you get up on the beam and have to do a backflip, you can’t be scared … that translates here. When someone shoots a puck, I don’t get scared. I’m like, ‘You know what? This will be fun, I’ll make a save.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual-sport senior, whose brother, Matt, protected the pipes at Long Beach in 2023 before graduating, noticed the Marines had no backup on the roster during a December 2024 game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jokingly, he was like, ‘Why don’t you try?’ I was like, ‘Haha, very funny.’ Then I thought about it, and I was like, ‘You know what? It looks like a lot of fun,’ ” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I got my brother’s old gear, and I just tried to get on the ice as much as possible,” added the 17-year-old goaltender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ice in her veins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could only “get from point A to point B” on skates at first, but took a crash course in early 2025 to be ready for her one-time chance to play before graduating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe where she’s at now,” head coach Rob Carson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt also put his little sis through goalie boot camp so she would be battle-tested when it came time to take the crease as a varsity player — the team’s only female member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was nonstop messaging me, ‘Sophie’s playing. Sophie’s ready. I’ve been shooting on her. She’s ready. She’s getting good,’ ” Carson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s the hardest worker during practice — and the kids feed off that. They see that she didn’t have that upbringing like most of them did, where they were skating when they’re 5 years old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino, a diehard Islanders fan who now studies goalie Ilya Sorokin (when not focused on her heartthrob, Matthew Schaefer), brings more than just a fierce gymnast mentality to the hockey team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sophie Marino, goalie for the Long Beach High School boys varsity hockey team, poses for a portrait during a team practice. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Heather Khalifa for the NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The flexibility and the endurance came easily to me,” said Marino, who added that Matt helped with reflex and hand-eye skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took his old No. 32 out of love and saw action early in the team’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A blossoming butterfly &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson first called Marino in to play — with a comfortable lead — in the third period against Bethpage for trial by fire on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although slapshots don’t make her flinch, the pressure certainly did at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was terrified,” said Marino, who was sweating with nerves on the frozen surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting goaltender Justin Mele could tell the tense moment could be cut with a skate blade, so he made a kind gesture to help Marino warm up to take her mind off the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I calmed down, and I went out there, and I just played. One kid had a really good shot, and I saved it. So it was really cool,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sophie Marino, the goalie for the boys hockey team at Long Beach High School, is also competing in gymnastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Long Beach Athletics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her next call to the net wasn’t like the 13-0 blowout win for the Marines, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino needed to start against Half Hollow Hills when Mele was injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was once again “terrified,” but the entire Marines squad stepped up again to boost the new player’s confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we first got on the ice, they usually don’t come over, but all the guys did, and they huddled up with me, which is really awesome,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the first shot, I was just like, ‘You know what? It’s OK, it’ll be fine.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino stood the test — and stopped an “awesome” breakaway in the third while tied — as Long Beach brought home a thrilling, last-minute 6-5 victory, which Mele said “she really did her best” in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was actually very proud of her,” added the starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-2-1 bunch clinched a top playoff spot with one regular-season game remaining, while Marino, who does vault, bars, beam, and floor events, earned a spot in February’s gymnastics state qualifiers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance might as well be her middle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was one time when I had a gymnastics meet, and then I left right away and went straight to the hockey game — and we won both, which is really cool,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you told me I was going to be on the boys hockey team … started, and we would have won — while doing varsity gymnastics at the same time, I’d say ‘No way, you’re lying.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Hochul&lt;/a&gt; pledged to save drivers a bundle of money on car insurance by switching state laws on personal injury lawsuits – but high-powered attorneys want to ensure that never happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul  said she will push reforms that would put the brakes on soaring auto insurance premiums as New Yorkers pay an average of $4,000 per year — a whopping $1,500 more than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her pitch to change the state’s nebulous “serious injury” threshold to weed out minor lawsuits has already riled the NYS Trial Lawyers Association, a high-octane lobby whose members donate big bucks to Democratic legislators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul’s pledged crackdown on auto insurance fraud and “runaway litigation” to help lower sky high insurance rates is running into fierce opposition from the powerful trial lawyers lobby. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Video Supplied&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Weakening victim protections lets Big Insurance off the hook while working families pay more,” the association said in a statement. The group has already &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xAI4tjXNKb0icxYLxyXATfCbfpeNLS-F/view?usp=drivesdk" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released a video&lt;/a&gt; showing the Democratic governor side-by-side with Florida Republican Ron DeSantis both blasting lawsuit payouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea that auto insurance companies will suddenly ‘do the right thing’ and lower rates is laughable,” the group added. “New Yorkers are too smart to buy it. These are the same insurers that jack up our premiums year after year, post record profits—and get regulators to sign off on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York’s legal definition of what constitutes a “serious injury” is vague can include smaller injuries that sideline someone involved in an accident for a short time. Hochul wants to change the threshold and propose “objective and fair medical standards” for what qualifies as serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of a concrete definition, she said individuals have tried to “game the system” to win high “jackpot” awards in court. The state observes a “comparative negligence” approach to accident liability — meaning even a driver mostly at fault for an accident can make claims for a percent of their damages, including non-economic damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul said in her annual State of the State address on Tuesday that she’d target high premiums with a crackdown on staged accidents, saying insurance companies are “jacking up prices” due to fraud and “runaway litigation costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The NYS Trial Lawyers Association released a video showing Hochul and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis blasting lawsuit payouts. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Video Supplied&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s be clear about how that happens,” Hochul said. “When the system allows out-of-control payouts those costs get passed on to you in the form of higher monthly bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Yorkers should not pay more for the same coverage and this is the year, we’re going to do something about it,” she added. “We’re putting the brakes on fraud and ending a system that rewards illegal behavior. If you were driving drunk, driving without a license, or committing a felony at the time of a crash, you should not get a payday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association said it supports “reasonable measures” to stop fraud and rein in the “delay-and-denial” business model insurers rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we don’t support are changes to liability standards that would further clog the courts, drag out cases, and give Big Insurance and ride-hailing giants a free ride. No New Yorker seriously believes that will make insurance cheaper,” the group said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Hochul’s reform plans includes putting a cap on non-economic damages for drivers engaging in criminal behavior at the time of an incident. That would bar uninsured motorists who have violated state financial responsibility laws, individuals convicted of driving while impaired, and those committing a felony or fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, she’s proposing legislation to ensure prosecutors can seek criminal penalties against any individual responsible for organizing a staged accident, not just the person behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawsuit Reform Alliance applauded the governor for tackling fraud and personal injury awards that jack up premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By tackling rampant fraud and reining in the perverse incentives built into New York’s existing laws, her proposals will help make insurance more affordable and our roads safer,” said LRA executive director Tom Stebbins. “They’ll also ensure the sophisticated actors who orchestrate these schemes are brought to justice and not merely the vulnerable people drawn into them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said sophisticated fraud rings recruit immigrants and those facing homelessness as the drivers that cause &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/us-news/nyc-car-insurance-fraudsters/"&gt;staged crashes&lt;/a&gt;, and unnecessary medical procedures and surgeries meant to increase the value of the claim follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 59-year-old man was charged Thursday with the nearly 30-year-old cold case strangulation murder of an unidentified woman inside a Queens motel – decades after he was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/us-news/nyc-man-who-killed-pregnant-ex-in-front-of-kids-hours-after-baby-shower-sentenced-to-40-years-to-life-in-prison/"&gt;convicted of killing a woman&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn in a similar way, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Velasquez, 59, formerly of Astoria, now stands accused of fatally strangling a “Jane Doe” victim – believed to be between 25 and 35 years old – inside Room 119 of the since-shuttered Turf Motel on 14th Street near Broadway in 1998, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman – who was carrying no identification – was discovered under a mattress, and wedged into the box spring of the bed, with a scarf tightly wrapped around her neck on Jan. 12, 1998, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that year, the city medical examiner’s office determined that the victim died by ligature strangulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the autopsy, investigators gathered DNA evidence from the victim’s underwear and scrapings and clippings of her fingernails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evidence was retested in May 2023, and investigators ultimately linked the DNA to Velasquez, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velasquez, meanwhile, was being held in an upstate lockup on a second-degree murder conviction for allegedly strangling another unidentified woman to death inside Park Slope’s Lincoln Plaza hotel – which is also now shuttered – in 1999, according to cops and online records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That woman was found by a maintenance worker in a filled-up bathtub on April 29 and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velasquez was arrested in connection to her murder on May 2 and convicted on April 27, 2000, following a jury trial, according to cops and Brooklyn prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already holed up in prison for 25 years on the Brooklyn case, Velasquez denied ever having been to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/10/us-news/queens-hotel-turned-migrant-shelter-sued-by-marriott-over-alleged-breach-of-contract/"&gt;Queens motel&lt;/a&gt; during an interview with members of the NYPD Cold Case Squad last year, the DA’s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was arraigned Thursday on a grand jury indictment, charging him with second-degree murder, and ordered held without bail by Supreme Court Justice Ushir Pandit-Durant, according to the DA’s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velasquez faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every victim matters, and we are committed to holding offenders accountable, no matter how long it takes. I thank members of my Cold Case Unit and our partners at the NYPD Cold Case Squad for their work on this case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New York prison guard who stood idly by as other &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/05/us-news/death-of-new-york-man-beaten-by-prison-guards-ruled-a-homicide-in-autopsy-report-lawyers-say/"&gt;guards beat a handcuffed inmate to death&lt;/a&gt; should be convicted of manslaughter, prosecutors argued Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former corrections officer Michael Fisher, 55, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter for the death of Robert Brooks, 43, who was seen &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/27/us-news/ny-prison-guards-beat-handcuffed-inmate-robert-brooks-video/"&gt;being repeatedly pummeled &lt;/a&gt;in an examination room at Marcy Correctional Facility in Oneida County on Dec. 9, 2024  in sickening body camera footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For seven minutes — seven gut-churning, nauseating, disgusting minutes — he stood in that room close enough to touch him, and he did nothing,” Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick told jurors during closing arguments on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Video shown to jurors captured former correctional officer Michael Fisher, 55, standing in the doorway as multiple officers began brutalizing inmate Robert Brooks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;NYS Correctional via NY Attorney General&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher was among 10 prison guards indicted in connection with Brooks’ death in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the last to stand trial as three others agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges. Six other guards pleaded guilty to manslaughter or lesser charges, four rejected plea deals, one was convicted of murder, and two others were acquitted in a trial last fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video shown to jurors captured Fisher standing in the doorway as multiple officers began brutalizing Brooks while he was handcuffed behind his back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body-worn camera footage from the incident showed the guards punching Brooks in the face and stomach, even stomping him in his lower torso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point during the nearly 30-minute excruciating clip, one guard appeared to hold Brooks in a chokehold for a moment as he was forced to sit up on an exam table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did Michael Fisher recklessly cause the death of Robert Brooks? Of course he did. Not by himself. He had plenty of other helpers,” Fitzpatrick told the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher’s attorney, Scott Iseman, urged jurors to consider what Fisher could have known at the time of the beatdown “without the benefit of 2020 hindsight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision launched an internal probe and placed 13 correctional officers and two nurses on unpaid suspension after the shocking incident. One officer resigned. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/05/us-news/death-of-new-york-man-beaten-by-prison-guards-ruled-a-homicide-in-autopsy-report-lawyers-say/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moderate Democrat has been chosen to lead the New York City Council committee charged with debating Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s proposed &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/lefty-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdanis-public-safety-plan-panned-by-policing-experts/"&gt;Department of Community Safety. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswald Feliz, a Bronx councilman, was tapped by Council Speaker Julie Menin for the the crucial public safety committee leadership spot, replacing Manhattan lawmaker Yusef Salaam, who is further to the left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feliz, 35, could have a considerable role in determining if the new safety agency — which will be tasked with tackling &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/us-news/zohran-mamdani-wants-social-workers-responding-to-911-calls-but-test-program-is-already-failing/"&gt;mental health calls&lt;/a&gt; across the five boroughs — becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

responses. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menin, who replaced now-former Queens Councilman Adrienne Adams as head of the Council, unveiled different committee assignments and leadership posts, including naming Queens lawmaker Natasha Williams deputy speaker and Manhattan elected official Shaun Abreu majority leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menin, of the Upper East Side, said her committee decisions weren’t based on ideology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about trying to restore faith in city government, which I think honestly, after the last four years, hit an all-time low around corruption, around fraud, around waste, around abuse. We are going to reform that,” she said in an apparent swipe at Eric Adams administration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani named a new “chief equity officer” Thursday – and her social media was deleted by the time she was announced to lead the administration’s woke “racial justice” efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But City Hall insisted newly tapped aides aren’t being asked to scrub their social media profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayor Zohran Mamdani with his newly appointed “chief equity officer” Afua Atta-Mensah at a prress conference in Harlem on Jan. 15, 2026. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Afua Atta-Mensah has dedicated her career to serving the New Yorkers who are so often forgotten in the halls of power,” Mamdani said in a statement. “There is no one I trust more to advance racial equity across our work in City Hall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta-Mensah, who had worked on Mamdani’s campaign focusing on trying to make headway with black voters. She’ll now serve as commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for Equity and Racial Justice, in which she will be charged with pushing for more racial equity across city government, City hall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s selections to help lead his administration have raised questions about his administration’s vetting process for candidates for public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Almonte Da Costa was &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/18/us-news/zohran-mamdani-appointee-catherine-almonte-da-costa-made-vile-antisemitic-comments-in-unearthed-social-media-posts/"&gt;supposed to be the city’s next director of appointments&lt;/a&gt;, but resurfaced antisemitic social media posts — including a rant about “money hungry Jews” — quickly led to her resignation last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source told The Post that Da Costa’s appointment was pushed through without a full examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that embarrassing flub, Mamdani said his team was tweaking their vetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s new director in the Office to Protect Tenants, Cea Weaver, has also caused an avalanche of controversy after various &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/zohran-mamdanis-new-nyc-tenant-advocate-called-to-seize-private-property-blasted-home-ownership-as-white-supremacy/"&gt;extreme stances on home ownership and landlords&lt;/a&gt; came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She once dismissed property ownership a “weapon of white supremacy” and called on the government to “seize private property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--nypostbusinessunit aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Morning Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamdani has stood by her despite the radical stances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear when Atta-Mensah deactivated her account, but it was up as recently as late last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the mayor’s office told The Post that the administration has not adopted a policy requiring new appointees to delete their X accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re nursing grudges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/11/us-news/ny-nurses-union-threatens-strike-with-hours-until-deadline/"&gt;massive nurses strike&lt;/a&gt; hitting three major New York City hospital systems hit its fourth day Thursday with no end in sight as both sides increasingly dug in, flinging bitter accusations of bullying, retaliation and sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15,000 nurses with Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian largely remained on the picket lines, joined by FDNY firefighters and a fresh crop of pols after Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/opinion/mayor-mamdani-just-joined-the-nurses-picket-line-against-himself/"&gt;show of solidarity&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the private medical centers seemingly kept seeing patients smoothly after executives shelled out an estimated $100 million for temporary nurses in preparation for protracted contract talks, a hospitals insider said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will keep it going as long as possible, as long as needed,” said Martine Clermont, 52, a striking emergency room nurse at Montefiore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A massive nurses strike stretched into its fourth day Thursday. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strike is the largest nurses’ walkout in city history and the longest in recent memory, far surpassing the 7,000 workers who picketed for three days in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while hospital executives were caught off guard three years ago by the strike — which ended with favorable contracts for the nurses — they’ve taken an aggressive stance this go-round after the New York State Nurses Association pushed for expanded health benefits and staffing and pay increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital leaders held firm that they couldn’t afford the nurses’ demands and prepared for war, finalizing strike plans with replacement staff as the union gave a 10-day walkout notice right after the New Year, said Ken Raske, president of the New York Greater Hospital Association, the trade group for Big Apple hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The hospitals have been preparing for months,” he said during an interview Thursday, estimating that the medical care systems have spent $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want to spend the money,” he said. “We were forced to spend the money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span data-slideshow-modal="count"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The dispute has no end in sight. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Matthew McDermott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hawkish hospital heads also took an unusually aggressive tack against the NYSNA — with Montefiore Medical Center leaders at one point contending the union tried to protect nurses who &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/us-news/major-nyc-hospital-accuses-nurses-union-of-protecting-drunk-stoned-staffers-as-thousands-go-on-strike/"&gt;showed up to work drunk or stoned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union officials had accused Montefiore of preventing nurses from accessing their and their families’ medications from hospital pharmacies, leading to an unfair labor practice complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Sinai, meanwhile, stunningly claimed that three labor and delivery nurses had tried to sabotage their workplace, while the union denied the accusation — shooting back that the workers were illegally fired by voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital system had also allegedly disciplined 14 nurse leaders as the strike loomed, union officials raged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the attacks were flying from both sides, those by the hospital officials carried the greater risk of backfiring, said retired state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who chaired its health committee for 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vehemence from the hospital side surprised me. I didn’t see those attacks in the past,” he told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The nurses are in a much stronger position with the public and elected officials. It’s hard to think of any group of employees in our economy more beloved and respected than nurses.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, strikers drew support from the Uniformed Firefighters Association, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and other elected officials at Mount Sinai Morningside Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurses ultimately have the upper hand with the public if the stalemate drags out, said veteran political consultant Hank Sheinkopf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who is more popular: the nurse or a hospital executive? It’s the nurse,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 250 nurses marched in a circle, chanting “Monte Monte you can’t hide, we can see your greedy side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Pugh, a nurse in the adult emergency department at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, faulted management for the stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This just feels like punishment. It feels like retaliation. It feels like they don’t want to negotiate with us because if they did, they would be out here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 2023, they were negotiating every day. They’re not (now),” she said. “The money that’s being spent on travelers, and putting band aids on things, it could be spent on this contract that works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveling, temporary nurses have seemingly helped keep the hospitals running smoothly, based on interviews with several patients who largely experienced no major hiccups with service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have no problem. I am not worried,” said Meybilin Portillo, 31, whose sister recently had a premature baby at New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Deborah Drummond, 58, said the nurse shortage created a hellish experience for her 96-year-old mother, who spent nearly 72 hours with pneumonia in the emergency room of Montefiore’s Einstein Campus in Morris Heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tried transferring her mother to Mount Vernon, before ultimately keeping her in the Bronx at Montefiore Hospital in Norwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They take damn good care of her here at Montefiore General. I’ve been able to sleep better at night knowing she’s taken care of,” Drummond said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It hasn’t been chaotic or anything they’ve been managing really well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Blakeman blasted Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s goal of phasing out &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/02/us-news/zohran-mamdani-plans-to-phase-out-gifted-and-talented-program-in-nyc-elementary-schools/"&gt;part of the Big Apple’s Gifted and Talented program&lt;/a&gt; — arguing student achievement should be “colorblind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County executive, during a press conference at the Guangdong Association in Manhattan, attempted to tie Gov. Kathy Hochul to the Democratic socialist’s education policy as the Long Island politician vowed to expand the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/us-news/court-tosses-suit-claiming-nycs-gifted-and-talented-programs-are-racially-biased-win-for-parents/"&gt;city’s Gifted and Talented programs have been a controversial issue&lt;/a&gt; that’s spanned mayoralties, with critics insisting the advanced learning model is racist because more white and Asian students clinch seats through exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporters have argued that tossing away the classes would reduce opportunities for impressive pupils from low- and middle-income families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All admission policy should be based on one thing, achievement and excellence,” Blakeman said when asked about efforts to get more black and Hispanic students into the top-tier classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It should be colorblind. It should be blind to race,” he added. “It should be blind to religion. It should be blind to your family’s status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also vowed to expand the specialized high schools for trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, absolutely, if there was a need, and I understand there is a need, I understand that the line to get into these schools is very, very long,” Blakeman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mamdani said on the campaign trail he wants to eliminate the high-performing program for kindergartens — though the portal for next year’s classes remains up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor also said before taking office he would embrace a policy similar to one dating back to Bill de Blasio’s era that would phase out the program in the lower grades in elementary schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hochul avoided answering where she stood on the G&amp;amp;T classes, stating, “This is a matter for the city,” she said at an unrelated press conference Thursday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Steven Chan (R- Brooklyn), who introduced a bill last year to expand G&amp;amp;T programs, vowed to fight any attempts to pare down the controversial classes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I believe all parents who have kids in those specialized schools, and gifted and talented, want that program to continue, but it’s going to be a long fight,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosalind Hernandez, 57, was convicted on one count each of second-and-third degree larceny by a jury for taking advantage of centenarian Antonio Ruas, conning him into granting her power of attorney over his finances when his health started to decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She took advantage of his advanced age and the fact that English wasn’t his first language,” Manhattan District Attorney Attorney Bragg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruas, a retired diamond cutter originally from Brazil, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/us-news/101-year-old-new-yorkers-takes-stand-against-apartment-super-who-allegedly-conned-him-out-of-350k/"&gt;testified &lt;/a&gt;via a Portuguese interpreter on Wednesday, telling jurors that Hernandez started plotting after he suffered a near-fatal fall in 2023 and decided to go back to his birthplace to be with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She thought I was going to die there and that she could keep all of the stuff,” he said in Manhattan Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez had promised to sell Ruas’ Chelsea apartment and transfer all of the money in his bank account, which he said totaled $700,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But months passed and he still hadn’t seen a cent in his Brazilian bank account, he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruas had even tipped Hernandez a cool $100,000 for her help tying up his affairs, he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the greedy super &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/us-news/nyc-building-super-accused-of-stealing-350k-from-100-year-old-tenant/"&gt;used his credit and debit cards &lt;/a&gt;to buy herself thousands of dollars worth of beauty products, clothes and self improvement subscriptions, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hernandez — who was described as a “lifeline” for senior tenants at the Chelsea Hall co-op &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/realestate/superintendent-caregiver-senior-tenants.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a 2023 New York Times profile&lt;/a&gt; — had become “very friendly” with Ruas after his partner died during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rosalind Hernandez stands convicted by a jury of her peers for abusing the trust of a 100-year-old, hardworking New Yorker to steal over half of his life savings as his Power of Attorney,” Bragg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury returned its verdict after just a few hours of deliberations, following the four-day trial that ended Thursday with closing arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Daniel Conviser allowed Hernandez to remain out on bail following the conviction. She faces up to 15 years in prison at her sentencing on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez’s attorney, Michael Hurwitz, declined to comment following the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An upstate New York school district allegedly used a “box-shaped wooden dog cage” to keep an 8-year-old, nonverbal autistic boy under control during class — and the youngster’s parents are livid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhonda Garrow, 37, a mom of four from Franklin County, filed a notice of claim Thursday informing the Salmon River Central School District that she will sue over the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/21/us-news/twisted-time-out-box-in-ny-classroom-spurs-outrage-this-is-sick/"&gt;twisted treatment of her disabled son&lt;/a&gt; — seeking compensation and demanding no other child is subjected to cruel practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel betrayed,” Garrow told The Post Thursday. “They used his disability against him because he can’t defend himself, he can’t stand up for himself. The only thing he can do is yell or cry or try to run away. And I feel that’s why they got this box so they can stuff him in there and just close the door.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;At least three wooden time-out boxes were built to keep disabled children at an upstate school, officials said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chrissy Jacobs/Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrow and the boy’s father, Jacob Sunday, claim in the court filing that the boy, identified only as M.J.S., was moved to the Salmon River elementary school on Dec. 12, and was just in his second day of classes there when a former district school board member blew the whistle on the boxes on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is sick,” ex-board member Chrissy Jacobs said in the bombshell Dec. 15 post. “This is supposed to be a school for our beloved babies, not a prison with a kid size.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the sick boxes were all the more disturbing since about 60% of district students — including Garrow’s son — are Native American, a population once forced to attend cruel boarding schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said there were at least three similar boxes in use in the district. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrow said she was blindsided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rhonda Garrow filed a notice of claim Thursday announcing she will sue the Salmon River Central School District. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Salmon River Central School District&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My first thought was just like, ‘Whoa. That’s crazy,'” she said. “And I hoped my son was never in there. I commented on it and then somebody reached out to me and said that they heard it was for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was sick to my stomach,” Garrow said. “When I found out I was Christmas shopping and I had my cart full of stuff, and I just like cashed out and went to the car and just cried. I don’t even know what I even thought. I just had to get out of there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--nypostbusinessunit aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Morning Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her lawyer, Greg Rinckey, said he’s never seen anything like it in 28 years practicing law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was an Army lawyer, I was an army JAG,” Rinckey said. “If any commander ever told me they were going to put a POW in this box, I would tell them they can’t. It’s in violation of the Geneva Convention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, it’s just outrageous they were putting an 8-year-old child in these wooden crates,” he said. “It almost looks like the custodian or the  janitor in the school district just built this out of plywood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Salmon River Central School District did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.srk12.org/statement-from-the-salmon-river-central-school-district-board-of-education-regarding-allegations-of-student-mistreatment/"&gt;statement after the controversy exploded&lt;/a&gt; online, School Board President Jason Brockway issued an apology, and told parents and promised an investigation — with the local tribal police, state troopers and the state Department of Education also probing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the district announced that it had fired the schools superintendent and said a &lt;a href="https://www.srk12.org/new-acting-superintendent-named-at-salmon-river-csd/"&gt;new acting schools chief was named &lt;/a&gt;at a school board meeting the day before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrow said it was too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think so. It’s like a Band-Aid,” she said. “It’s just enough so that it looks like they’re doing something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Long Island school superintendent was suspended after an investigation showed that he required all eighth graders in his district to enroll in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/23/new-nyc-hybrid-high-school-program-could-be-fully-remote-by-2023/"&gt;digital learning program&lt;/a&gt; — which his own company had created, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/07/proposed-bill-would-let-schools-opt-out-as-polling-sites/"&gt;Michael Nagler,&lt;/a&gt; who was named New York state’s “Superintendent of the Year” in 2024, was found to have violated ethics rules by pushing the “Build Your Own Grade” program developed by Quave, a company he founded with his son James last July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board of the Mineola Union Free School District hired private eyes to look into the alleged conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

style="aspect-ratio:1.50146628;display:block" width="886"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Superintendent Michael Nagler was suspended by the Mineola school district for ethics violations.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators found that Nagler had failed to disclose Quave’s for-profit status to the board before mandating the online grading app’s usage across the eighth grade — as trustees believed the system was created as an internal, voluntary project and not a private business venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never, ever crossed my mind to ask our superintendent if the volunteer service that his son was performing was going to be turned into a limited liability company with the intent of monetizing it,” board trustee Patrick Talty, told &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/mineola-school-board-michael-nagler-suspended-ms8smei6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newsday. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents in the district raised concerns about the program, which was killed by the district in October while the investigation was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Nichols, an attorney who investigated the case, said he interviewed 16 witnesses, including Nagler, and recently laid out his findings before dozens of parents and residents at a packed meeting in a high school auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagler eventually came clean to trustees that he had created the company, in part, to obtain tax write-offs and to protect his son’s intellectual property, Nichols confirmed to The Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Nagler’s grading system was hosted outside the district’s control, raising concerns about the security of student data on a privately owned server that had never been formally approved, Nichols said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagler, who has worked in Mineola since 1999 and has served as superintendent since 2009, was suspended last Thursday. He could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superintendent will remain on paid leave until the board’s next meeting on Jan. 22, while trustees review the investigation’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pervert kidnapped an 11-year-old Queens girl and took her to his Long Island home — where police allegedly found the pre-teen undressed on the predator’s bed, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Wieber, 28, started communicating with the elementary-aged girl through &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/tech/inside-the-world-of-discord-and-the-far-left-coded-games-radicalizing-young-boys/"&gt;Discord &lt;/a&gt;in early December, which is a popular online messaging platform, and allegedly picked her up from her school on Dec. 12, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little girl’s mother had been waiting for her daughter at the bus stop, but realized something was  wrong when she never got off, police said. &lt;/p&gt;

style="aspect-ratio:1.49926794;display:block" width="885"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Suffolk County DA Ray Tierney said Wieber’s arrest underscores the exceptional work of law enforcement. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dennis A. Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl’s mother started frantically searching the streets of Queens for her daughter and eventually learned that she was seen being picked up by an older man outside of her school, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mom then rushed straight to police and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/us-news/police-search-for-missing-teen-girl-who-vanished-in-washington-over-a-month-ago-and-want-to-speak-to-man-whose-car-she-got-into/"&gt;reported her daughter missing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYPD quickly tracked her to Wieber’s home in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/us-news/favorite-long-island-teacher-48-being-probed-for-allegedly-sexting-with-underage-student-sources/"&gt;Bay Shore, &lt;/a&gt;where Suffolk County police stepped in to assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one day after she went missing, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/11/us-news/slow-release-of-security-video-in-christmas-day-slay-of-long-island-cvs-worker-prompts-proposed-law/"&gt;Suffolk police&lt;/a&gt; found the girl inside the home, naked and on Wieber’s bed, officials detailed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This case underscores the exceptional work of law enforcement, whose coordinated response led&lt;br/&gt;to the recovery of a kidnapped child,” said Suffolk County District Attorney &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/us-news/gilgo-beach-serial-murder-case-judge-blows-gasket-over-rex-heuermanns-lawyers-dragging-feet-delaying-trial/"&gt;Ray Tierney.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their vigilance, skill, and determination ensured the child was found safely and returned to her parents without delay. Due to their outstanding investigative work, we were able to swiftly secure an indictment and begin holding the offender accountable,” Tierney added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieber was arraigned on Jan. 9 on a sweeping indictment that includes two counts of kidnapping and endangering the welfare of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme Court Justice &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/us-news/enough-fentanyl-to-kill-every-man-woman-and-child-on-long-island/"&gt;Richard Ambro&lt;/a&gt; ordered the sicko to be held on $250,000 cash bail, a $500,000 bond or a $2.5 million partially secured bond while the case moves forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wieber pleaded not guilty and faces life in prison if convicted on the top charge. He is due back in court Feb. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Larry Flowers, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crazed commuter punched an MTA conductor so hard that he hit his head on the wall of a subway train — during a brutal attack in Queens early Thursday, cops and sources said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maniac slugged the 37-year-old transit worker in the face on board a Manhattan-bound A train passing through Beach 25th Street in Far Rockaway around 1:30 a.m., after exchanging words with him, according to authorities and sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blow was so forceful that the conductor hit his head on the train cabin wall, police said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disturbed Staten Island teenager charged with decapitating his mom’s boyfriend will seek an insanity defense, his lawyer revealed Thursday — saying the accused killer is schizophrenic and was off his meds at the time of the gruesome crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damien Hurstel, 19, only spiraled out of control after he came of age, meaning he was no longer a minor under his parents’ care and his mother was barred from forcing him to take his medication, defense attorney Mark Fonte argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When he’s medicated he is a loving child,” Fonte claimed to reporters outside the courtroom, where the troubled teen — who is being held at the psych unit on Rikers Island — appeared for a brief hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Damien Hurstel, 19, is charged with murder for allegeldy decapitating his mother’s boyfriend on Staten Island. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LP Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When he’s not medicated he suffers from severe, very severe, mental health issues including schizophrenia and history of seizures, schizophrenia, mental health episodes that his family was on top of,” Fonte said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurstel flew off the rails during the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/07/us-news/troubled-staten-island-teen-accused-of-decapitating-moms-bf-shares-gory-confession-details/"&gt;bloody Oct. 6 2025, attack&lt;/a&gt; inside the family’s Cary Avenue home, but is now the passive person he’s capable of being when he’s taking his meds, his attorney claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, as of today and for the court proceedings, he’s in a much better place than he was at the time of the incident,” Fonte said. “The issue before the court is what was his mental health like at the time of the incident, not what it is like today in the courtroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unhinged teen is accused of bludgeoning 45-year-old Anthony Casalaspro to death with a meat tenderizer because he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone, according to authorities and law enforcement sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alicia Zayas, the mother of accused killer Damien Hurstel, 19, in court on Staten Island in his murder case. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Martinka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his arrest, he allegedly admitted to cops at the NYPD’s 120th Precinct stationhouse that he had tried to sever Casalaspro’s head with a knife, but grew frustrated and picked up a hand saw instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sick teen allegedly told police he had planned to liquify the body in a blender and flush the remains down the toilet, starting with the dead man’s brain, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--nypostbusinessunit aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Morning Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos from the crime scene showed a bloodied Hurstel covered in blood and strapped to a stretcher as police took him into custody and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/08/us-news/staten-island-teen-who-allegedly-decapitated-moms-boyfriend-hospitalized-delaying-first-court-appearance/"&gt;shipped him off to a local hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police said Hurstel had gotten into a spat with his mom earlier in the day, and Casalaspro told him to take a walk to cool down. When he returned, Casalaspro was alone and the teen allegedly attacked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In court Thursday, the lanky, 6-foot-tall Hurstel appeared attentive, wearing khaki scrubs and smiled after spotting his uncle and his mom, Alicia Zayas, in the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk baby mama Ashley St. Clair is suing his AI platform, Grok, for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/14/us-news/elon-musks-baby-mama-ashley-st-clair-says-she-is-not-scared-of-anyone-takes-jab-at-trump-as-she-takes-on-predatory-x/"&gt;refusing to stop making sexually explicit deepfake images of her &lt;/a&gt;— including phony pictures of her as a nude child — and then retaliated against her when she demanded the harassment to stop, according to legal papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks an emergency restraining order against Grok, calling it “unreasonably dangerous,” and demands it to cease creating digitally altered sexual imagery of her — and to restore her X account subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am humiliated and feel like this nightmare will never stop so long as Grok continues to generate these images of me,” St. Clair said in a court filing. “I live in fear that my nude and sexual images, including of me as a child, will continue to spread and that I will not be safe from the people who consume these images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer representing xAI declined to comment, and the company did not immediately respond to a message,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Clair, who waging a custody battle with Musk over their son, first discovered the first disturbing post by his xAI chatbot, Grok, on Jan 4, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grok then used AI to digitally alter the image, swapping her clothing for a “black string bikini.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appalled,” she publicly asked Grok to remove the non-consensual image, to which the AI responded by calling the image “humorous,” filings claim. It said, however, that her images would no longer be used or altered without her “explicit consent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a lie,” her suit reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X accounts discovered photos of St. Clair at 14-years-old, and requested Grok remove her clothing and dress her in a bikini, she claims,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;X accounts discovered photos of St. Clair at 14-years-old, and requested Grok remove her clothing and dress her in a bikini, she claims. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Grok obliged,” according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples of sicko images as an adult are described in the suit, depicting her “covered in semen,” kneeling and exposing her buttock with “a string of dental floss draped over her anus,” ostensibly nude in a “bikini made out of floss,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others further altered the images with Grok, asking the bot to give the Jewish St. Clair swastikas tattoo — plus others that read “Elon’s whore” and “I suck c— for money,” the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite asking Grok to remove the images — and reporting the content — many of the AI-altered photos remained online for more than a week, she claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other users noticing her “public pleas” for Grok to remove the sexual images shared their similar experiences, St. Clair said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that one woman claims that Grok had used an image of her four-year-old child “whose dress had been removed and replaced with a bikini and her entire body looked as though it was dripping with semen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Despite asking Grok to remove the images — and reporting the content — many of the AI-altered photos remained online for more than a week, the lawsuit claims.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Clair says instead of addressing the “unsafe” Grok, the company retaliated against her, removing her premium subscription and stripping her of the ability to monetize her account — and banned her from reinstating her status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have experienced debilitating privacy violations,” St. Clair said. “I have not consented to have xAI use me to sexually entertain its users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians, including California Governer Gavin Newsom, have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/14/us-news/newsom-urges-probe-of-musks-x-over-explicit-ai-deepfake-images/"&gt;demanded investigations over the AI deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, ‘including images that digitally undress children.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of Musk’s 13th child, Romulus, is embroiled in a custody battle with the billionaire, who this week&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/us-news/elon-musk-wants-full-custody-of-son-after-baby-mama-ashley-st-clairs-comments-on-transgenderism/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; threatened to seek full custody &lt;/a&gt;of the 1-year-old in response to St. Clair’s recent public apology for past anti-trans comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing legal battle,&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/14/us-news/elon-musks-baby-mama-ashley-st-clair-says-she-is-not-scared-of-anyone-takes-jab-at-trump-as-she-takes-on-predatory-x/"&gt; she told The London Times&lt;/a&gt; this week that “I’m not scared of anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyshaun Watson, who had pleaded guilty in exchange for a promised 17-year prison sentence, launched into a wild rant during the Manhattan Supreme Court hearing, claiming he’d been “provoked” before he pummeled pizza-maker Zakaira El Sherief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was being provoked… if you watch the video,” he railed — until Judge Laura Ward interrupted and shot back at him that “Maybe we should go to trial on this and let the jury decide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watson, 36, continued to bizarrely claim that “facts” from surveillance footage of the of the Aug. 19, 2024 assault inside Roma Pizza in the Flatiron District proved the poor employee had instigated a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we play the video, you’re going to trial and looking at 25 years,” the judge threatened, before eventually playing the footage for the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You were the first one to go behind the counter. He did not come out to get you,” a seething Ward snapped at him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the footage showed a wobbly Watson walking into the eatery with his black pit bull unleashed, then ordering two slices of pizza and a drink and taking a seat in the back of the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager was seen coming over to him three times to speak, apparently telling him he could not have a dog without a leash inside the pizzeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson eventually picked up his slices and walked to the counter at front of the restaurant, where El Sherief packed the pizza in a to-go box, before the two appeared to start yapping at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson then walks behind the counter, punches the victim and wrestles him to the ground — where he then starts to pummel him as his dog begins attacking the pair, the footage shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--nypostbusinessunit aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Morning Report"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Sherief eventually was able to get himself up and out of the pizzeria, where he attempted to block the doors to prevent his assailant from getting away — but Watson pushed his way through and began the vicious beating again, tackling the victim to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The defendant stomped on the manager’s head, not once, but twice, as he laid unresponsive against the hard concrete,” Assistant District Attorney Nicole Borczyk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor said Watson became “irate” when the 47-year-old victim told him repeatedly that his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/31/us-news/pizzeria-assault-apology-not-accepted-by-co-workers-of-victim/"&gt;pit bull wasn’t allowed inside the pizza parlor&lt;/a&gt;, prompting the horrific attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beating left El Sherief in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/us-news/nyc-pizzeria-worker-mauled-by-customers-pit-bull-in-vicious-attack-cops/"&gt;medically induced coma for two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. He ended up spending two months in the hospital for multiple fractures and brain bleeding, but has since been able to make a “miraculous recovery,” prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/us-news/brute-who-beat-nyc-pizzeria-worker-while-pit-bull-attacked-called-unconscious-victim-f-king-b-h-prosecutors/"&gt;who called the manager a “f–king b–ch” during the beatdown,&lt;/a&gt; initially claimed that “whiskey played a part” in the vicious assault, the judge noted, before letting him address the court at the dramatic sentencing hearing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Watson admitted to throwing the first punch. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Obtained by NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rewatching the video in court, Ward gave Watson another chance to avoid trial and to stick with the 17-year sentence settled upon as part of his plea agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, who copped to two counts of assault in the first degree on Dec. 3, 2025, finally admitted to “absolutely” throwing the first punch before offering a half-hearted apology to the victim, who was not in court as expected because he was feeling ill, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Watson then began complaining about the length of his “excessive” sentence, complaining that it was more fit for a homicide — irking the judge even more. Prosecutors had initially recommended a sentence of 25 years behind bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count="" data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ward eventually found that Watson had taken responsibility — but warned him that she would fight to make sure he stayed in the slammer for his full sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just so you know, I will use everything in my power whenever you come up for a parole review, to make sure that you stay in (prison) for the entire 17 years,” the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson’s attorney, Samantha Chorny, said outside the courtroom she felt that her client had taken accountability for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brazen trio robbed a Manhattan Pokémon shop at gunpoint – making off with more than $100,000 in rare trading cards – as dozens gathered for a community event, according to cops and employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage of the shocking heist &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/pokmon-shop-robbed-100000-merchandise-armed-burglars-manhattan/18404893" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;obtained by WABC&lt;/a&gt; shows the hooded, masked suspects – wearing anime-themed backpacks – barging into Poké Court on West 13th Street near Washington Street in the Meatpacking District where about 40 people gathered around 6:45 p.m. Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew, including one suspect armed with a gun, used hammers to smash the glass covering the displays inside the shop, which just opened in early November, the footage shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spewing threats as they raided the store, the trio eventually made off with more than $116,000 in Pokémon cards, $1,000 cash and a cell phone belonging to a 27-year-old woman, cops said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rare, stolen cards – the oldest dating back to 1999 and the newest from 2016 – depicted the  characters Treecko, Charizard, Pikachu and Ho-Oh, according to images posted to the store’s Instagram story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone here is safe,” Courtney Chin, the founder of Poké Court,&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DThGXC4jJ5P/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; said in a video&lt;/a&gt; posted to the store’s Instagram, with the smashed display behind her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motoclick stole directly from its own workers by charging them $10 fees for canceled orders and deducting refunded orders from their pay, the lawsuit filed by the city’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/us-news/mayor-zohran-mamdani-raises-eyebrows-by-joining-15k-striking-nyc-nurses/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Consumer and Worker Protection&lt;/a&gt; alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app owes workers millions of dollars in stolen pay and damages, according to the filing – which seeks to sue Motoclick out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an indicator of the new era that we are here in New York City, and that is a new era where it’s not just holding Motoclick to account, but it’s holding any app company to account if they are operating outside of the rules and the laws of New York,” Mamdani said during a news conference announcing the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing comes just days after Mamdani’s administration accused DoorDash and Uber Eats of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/business/doordash-uber-eats-erased-550m-in-delivery-worker-tips-in-nyc-mamdani-administration-alleges/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preventing delivery workers&lt;/a&gt; from earning more than $550 million in tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-two punch against the delivery apps is part of Mamdani’s promised crackdown on “predatory” apps that he contends are stealing money from hard-working delivery workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Hizzoner has pledged his Department of Consumer and Worker Protection will be more aggressive on behalf of New Yorkers, whether workers or customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to be very clear: City Hall does not desire to have an adversarial relationship with any business operating in our city,” Mamdani said. “We cannot tell the story of the city without also telling the story of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To those, however, who think they can make a profit while stealing from their workers, while breaking the law, make no mistake. We will have those workers’ backs each and every time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Levine, the department’s new commissioner, said “billion-dollar corporations” should be on notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uber and Doordash do not make their food, they don’t serve the food, they don’t ride the bikes, they don’t repair the bikes, they don’t deliver the food,” he said. “It’s time that we stand up for the people who actually make deliveries a core part of the city — that actually make our economy work, and that’s the working people of New York.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motoclick didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reckless Long Island teen who left six people injured in a late-night hit-and-run crash — including a woman who had to have her legs amputated — is on his way to prison, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valdemar Meza-Martinez was just 16 and driving illegally with a learner’s permit around 1:30 a.m. Aug. 4, 2024, when he slammed his 2010 Nissan Rogue into another car in Wyandanch, trapping the horribly injured woman between two cars — then took off running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cops later caught up with Meza-Martinez, who was busted and pleaded guilty in September to a felony charge of leaving the scene of an incident resulting in serious physical injury, &lt;a href="https://www.suffolkcountyda.org/17-year-old-sentenced-to-prison-for-leaving-the-scene-of-a-crash-that-severed-victims-legs-and-injured-five-others/"&gt;prosecutors announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Valdemar Meza-Martinez, 17, was sentenced to up to four years in prison for a 2024 Long Island hit-and-run crash. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meza-Martinez, now 17, was hit with a sentence of 1⅓ to 4 years in prison this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These injuries are life-altering,” said Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney, who agreed to the plea deal with Meza-Martinez but ripped state laws that prevented him from giving the teen more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that a driver could strike this victim, taking her legs, flee the scene as if nothing happened, and then only face a maximum 1⅓ to 4 years, is incomprehensible,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is completely callous to leave an injured individual on the side of the road without checking on their well-being or seeking help,” Tierney added. “I will continue to push our state lawmakers to pass legislation to increase the penalties for hit-and-run cases with serious physical injury and death in order to deter drivers from fleeing the scenes of crashes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to authorities, Meza-Martinez was driving on Patton Avenue when he came upon two vehicles that were stopped after a fender-bender, with occupants of both cars outside the vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Valdemar Meza-Martinez was 16 and driving with a learner’s permit during the violent 2024 Long Island hit-and-run. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;KYLE MAZZA/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teen crashed into the back of a 2014 Kia Optima, which was next to a 2013 Toyota Camry — the two vehicles involved in the earlier minor collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meza-Martinez slammed the Optima into the Camry, injuring those in the crowd and pinning the woman between the two cars, instantly crushing her legs and leaving her trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital, where she underwent surgery “to amputate the remainder of her legs,” Suffolk County prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meza-Martinez took off running, but was picked up at his home 11 hours later, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A two-star Midtown Manhattan hotel is facing allegations it has become a front for prostitution — and the city has sued to get the doors closed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass double doors at 38 W. 31st St., known as the NoMad Suites, open to a narrow lobby where unsuspecting tourists wheel in their suitcases in and out. But at night, neighbors say, the tone shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You see women dressed like they’re going to a club, walking in and out around midnight with other men,” one man, who declined to be identified, and who’s been living in a short-term Airbnb rental at the NoMad Suites for the past three months, told The Post in response to the lawsuit. “I figured they were just hosting parties. Now it feels a little more obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NoMad Suites is the subject of a newly filed lawsuit from the City of New York, which accuses the building’s owners and operators of allowing sex work to flourish unchecked inside guest rooms while marketing the property as a legitimate hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint obtained by The Post, filed on Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court, calls for a full one-year closure and $1,000-a-day fines against landlord 1234 Broadway LLC and other named respondents. A representative for the building’s ownership entity could not be reached for comment. No criminal charges have been filed in connection to the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the building briefly operated as a city-run homeless shelter for New Yorkers. That stint ended in tragedy when a 36-year-old man &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/09/man-stabbed-to-death-at-nyc-hotel-shelter-police/"&gt;was stabbed to death&lt;/a&gt; inside the property. The shelter closed not long after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the building has transitioned back into private use. But it now operates as a hybrid hotel/Airbnb/apartment mix, offering nightly bookings and longer stays. Online listings show roughly 13 short-term suites, with the additional rental units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Airbnb units in the building, with an alternate address of 1234 Broadway, advertises as “one of the very few fully legal Airbnbs in Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities charge the hotel’s quiet return to commercial use has masked illicit activity promoted openly online and confirmed through undercover NYPD stings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These advertisements included … explicit images and/or suggestive statements,” the complaint says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint also alleges that city officials found an online ad promising: “We are cute and sexy Asian girls,” and “hot body” at the premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, on Sept. 4, 2025, one officer entered Suite 142 of the building and was offered a massage and “manual stimulation” for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, another officer was directed to the suite where a woman allegedly agreed to provide oral sex for $150, in addition to $100 for a “30 minutes of massage therapy,” the filing says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Police are seen in front of  38 W. 31st St. on May 8, 2021 where a man was stabbed and later died. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Robert Mecea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the building presents a polished image online, with listings offering “non-smoking rooms” and a “24-hour front desk,” city officials claim the reality inside is far more dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Defendants have owned, leased, used, maintained or conducted the subject premises for the purpose of prostitution, and have permitted, promoted, condoned or acquiesced in the use of the subject premises for the illegal activity,” the filing alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple visiting from Greensboro, North Carolina, who booked an Airbnb unit inside the NoMad Suites, told The Post on Wednesday they hadn’t seen anything overtly suspicious — but did hear plenty. They declined to provide their names for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of hooting and hollering, and drunk people at night,” they said. “But nothing that made us think this was going on. That is crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four men sharing another Airbnb rental, who also did not share their names, said they had no idea the property was under city investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just thought it was a regular Airbnb,” one told The Post. “We just walk around the neighborhood. We don’t know anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while most guests from out of town were oblivious to the activity, the complaint highlights that some locals were very aware of what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A review of the records of the New York City Police Department reflects that in July and August of 2025, multiple members of the public contacted the NYPD and alleged that prostitution was occurring at the subject premises,” the complaint said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next door to the building is MRA Fragrances, a perfume shop that leases space through the same landlord now being sued. The store’s owner, who also declined to share his name, said he’s concerned the city’s case could put his business in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see so many people coming in and out, it’s hard to keep track,” he said. “A lot of people from out of the country come — they’re the main customers. But now I’m worried. If the city shuts that building, I have to close too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dozens of guests and tenants flowing in and out, officials say the building became the perfect cover for illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the street, a shop manager of a jewelry store who also declined to share his name, said his store closes at 6 p.m. — well before the street gets rowdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t seen anything,” he said, “but then again, I leave before dark. Maybe at night you see more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul wouldn’t rule out&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/10/us-news/tax-the-motherf-king-rich-elected-socialists-privately-threaten-hochul-if-she-doesnt-fall-in-line/"&gt; future income tax hikes in the Empire State&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday — as questions swirl over how the state will fund its promised universal child care program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic governor, who is up for re-election this year, stood by a pledge not to slam taxpayers with an increase this year but wouldn’t rule out future increases as she faces mounting pressure to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/14/us-news/hochul-critics-warn-ny-cant-afford-state-of-the-state-affordability-promises-including-universal-childcare/"&gt;fund a freebie-filled agenda&lt;/a&gt; favored by the liberal wing of her party and Big Apple Mayor Zohran Mamdani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now just 15 days into the Mamdani administration, Hochul appeared to be softening her stance and pointed the finger at the Trump administration as possible justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously we have to look at if Donald Trump eviscerates half our budget or some cataclysmic circumstance in the future, I have to keep all options on the table,” Hochul said when pressed by The Post on how her vision of universal child care would be funded after this year’s initial $4.5 billion investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochul said she will not raise taxes this year in order to fund the new investments for 2,000 initial seats in a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/08/us-news/gov-hochul-announces-lofty-plan-to-offer-free-child-care-nyc-2-year-olds/"&gt;new “2-care” program for Big Apple 2-year-olds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside groups have put forward rough estimates that a fully realized universal child care program could run upward of $12 billion to $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Brooklyn attorney tasked with holding onto $2 million of investor funds made a mystery transfer the same day he received the cash — and it remains missing, according to new court filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lawyers for the foreign investors are now alleging that some of the funds may have landed in longtime &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/06/us-news/nyc-power-broker-frank-seddio-ripped-for-calling-judges-cell-phone-amid-2m-case/"&gt;Democratic power-broker Frank Seddio’s account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businessmen have been trying to recoup their multi-million dollar investment for about a year, as the case has gotten dragged out in court, hindered by Seddio’s alleged legal machinations, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mark David Graubard leaving court on Wednesday after filing bank records showing that the same day $2 million of investor money entered his escrow account, he sent it to a third party LLC. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peter Senzamici&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was revealed in court this week that the funds were transferred to an anonymous third party, a shell company called 536 Holdings LLC, the same day they landed in lawyer Mark David Graubard’s escrow account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graubard — who was supposed to keep the money in escrow for the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/31/us-news/longtime-top-brooklyn-party-leader-is-running-con-jobs-suit/"&gt;sole purpose of proving the two potential investors had the funds for a proposed deal &lt;/a&gt;— filed bank records showing $2 million entering and leaving his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claimed in court papers that all transactions “were done pursuant to written instructions by persons who had authority to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only the investors had the right to make any decisions about the money, &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=yaVU1WEsLj73HjnSxuoJrQ==" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to the signed escrow agreements&lt;/a&gt;, including a clause that Graubard couldn’t touch “any part of the Escrow Deposit for any reason or in any way” without their written permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some of that money may have landed in Brooklyn power broker Frank Seddio’s account, according to the investor’s attorneys.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Gregory P. Mango&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Graubard maintained he had the money, and that he was ready to deposit it with the court when a prior judge on the case ordered him to last summer. He never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new documents could bolster a long held fear of the investors’ that their money is long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate set of the escrow account records obtained by subpoena in a related federal lawsuit, according to the investors’ attorney Babak Ghafarzade, showed “certain specific and highly suspicious transactions” — including one to Seddio’s law firm, which was technically suing Graubard at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghafarzade added that the account was closed out entirely in June, which Graubard had never disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Seddio denied that he ever received a payment from the escrow account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graubard appeared in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Wednesday, before the fifth judge in the winding case, to finally produce the bank records for his escrow account months after court orders to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trio of sheriff’s deputy sat in the courtroom ready to fulfill an arrest warrant for Graubard issued by Judge Francois Rivera if the lawyer failed to produce the records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I cannot even begin to imagine why an attorney, an officer of the court, would risk everything: his license, his liberty… to willfully disobey a court order,” said Judge Francois Rivera. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Latino Judges Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge found the bank statement submission lacking due to missing pages and excessive redactions blocking some account balances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rivera decided the subpoenaed records were sufficient, and scheduled a frivolity hearing for March for Graubard over his “failure to comply with repeated court orders” in lieu of arrest, where each finding could carry a fine of $10,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graubard and his lawyer Israel Goldberg refused to comment after court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Graubard later sent The Post multiple amended statements, which first claimed he has “fully complied with all laws and judicial rulings regarding this meritless case,” and called the idea that escrow funds had been misappropriated “patently false.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long winding case, initiated by Seddio allegedly to block the investors from getting their money returned, has meandered through courts for over a year, and is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/17/us-news/at-least-4-nyc-judges-have-left-case-involving-bk-dem-power-broker-and-missing-2m/"&gt;now on its fifth judge due to repeated recusals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concurrent federal lawsuit filed by the investors claiming the former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair is helping run a “con job” by abusing the court system. He has denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is a real throne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new comfort station nestled in a Staten Island playground snagged a coved design and architecture award this week — and could serve as the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/10/us-news/mamdanis-4-m-plan-for-providing-desperate-new-yorkers-relief-self-cleaning-public-bathrooms/"&gt;mold for hundreds more throughout the Big Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lopez Playground Modular Public Restroom in Fox Hills was one of 24 projects honored at this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.aiany.org/architecture/featured-projects/view/lopez-playground-modular-comfort-station/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;American Institute of Architects New York Design Awards&lt;/a&gt; because of its “modular construction method.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Lopez Playground Modular Comfort Station was honored at this year’s American Institute of Architects New York Design Awards. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael McWeeney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The jury was looking for projects that solve real-world challenges and represent the idea that architecture is for everyone!” Brie Hensold, an urban planner with HASLA and a member of this year’s voting jury, told The Post in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Lopez Playground Comfort Station is a small building — but it is a smart, cost-effective way to solve an everyday problem. We loved that its impact is much bigger than one park. 1100 Architect designed the station to be replicated across the city: the small building can be manufactured off site, which reduces construction time and keeps the Parks Department from having to close a park to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping container-like comfort station is the first of its kind for the Big Apple — and the modular design means that it was created at a Pennsylvania factory in three pieces that were transported and assembled at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3.8 million project took just 4.5 years to complete and was unveiled in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The bathrooms appeared clean during a visit by The Post this week. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Michael McWeeney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price was higher than a similarly sized bathroom in the Bronx’s Soundview Park,  which&lt;a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/capital-project-tracker/project/4757" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; cost $2.1 million&lt;/a&gt; but took twice as long to build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a visit by The Post on Wednesday, the modular Staten Island restroom appeared well-kept, save for some graffiti on its walls that appeared as though a worker tried and failed to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, Staten Islanders love their little restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “For a public outside bathroom, this is definitely award-winning. We’ve been to so many other parks in other boroughs and they are terrible compared to this one,” said Sherifat Kasumu, a TSA Worker from Park Hill, pointing to the 4 p.m. closing time as the potential reason the restroom doesn’t get trashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dyron Rodriguez, 30, agreed that the public toilets were “award-winning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They look all new and fancy … There’s nothing I would change in the bathroom to make it better honestly,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as everything’s working, and the kids could use it, and it stays clean, that’s good to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanson Louis’s only complaint was that the three toilets for each gendered entrance were not enough, sometimes causing a long line and wait on crowded days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been in the worst bathrooms. Especially on the inside, it’s nice. Even at restaurants and things like that, there have been bad bathrooms,” Fatima Varo, 32, added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are so many bathrooms where you need a tissue just to open the door because of how dirty they are, but this one is a 10/10.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design accolade and high praise could mean that more could soon sprout across the Big Apple, though without the alternating blue, white and grey paint streaks that the designers picked specifically to reflect “the neighborhood and community” that the original serves, AIA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A red, yellow and orange version is &lt;a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/capital-project-tracker/project/10056" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expected to land in Fort Washington Park&lt;/a&gt; in the next year or so, and two more of un&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know that New Yorkers deserve accessible, well-maintained public restrooms and we’re working to build them more quickly and efficiently,” a spokesperson for the agency told The Post, adding that the prefabricated restroom “allows for increased construction quality control, limits the impact to the public, reduces weather-related delays, and saves time and money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was handed down just two days after Mayor Mamdani pledged $4 million to install up to 30 high-quality modular public restrooms throughout the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that a judge had no jurisdiction to order the release of Columbia University graduate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/tag/mahmoud-khalil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mahmoud Khalil&lt;/a&gt; from immigration detention, delivering President Trump’s administration a victory in its &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/17/us-news/immigration-judge-rules-mahmoud-khalil-to-be-deported-to-syria-or-algeria-citing-green-card-fraud-court-docs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;efforts to deport the pro-Palestinian activist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2-1 panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the dismissal of a lawsuit Khalil filed challenging his detention after finding that federal immigration law stripped the lower court of jurisdiction over his claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footage of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/11/opinion/with-cea-weaver-mamdani-signals-the-dangerous-truth-of-his-housing-plan-for-nyc/"&gt;Weaver’s past controversial remarks&lt;/a&gt; are among the latest to go explode on social media ever since Mamdani tapped the 37-year-old to be his new director of the city Office to Protect Tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We decided that fighting for rent control was a strategic and critical first step in the fight for full social housing,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/michelletandler/status/2011529696698343517" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;she said in a newly resurfaced clip that is going viral on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t immediately clear when — or where — Weaver made the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She went on to argue, though, that a push for regulation could potentially “strike a blow to the entire real estate industry at once” by challenging housing as a wealth-building tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that we could weaken the entire industry at once through a strong rent control campaign, and that would strengthen our ability to do things like fight for social housing,” she said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startling comments drew frightened backlash on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaver, who is a proud Democratic Socialists of America member, has a long history of housing activism in the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-nyp-editor-universal-promo"&gt;
&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyebrow-raising comments are just the latest to spark outrage over her extreme housing views.&lt;br/&gt;In the wake of her City Hall appointment, a series of Weaver’s past social media posts surfaced, including ones where she blasted homeownership as a “weapon of white supremacy” and moaned about gentrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The far-left political organization were quick to claim the criticism directed at &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/06/us-news/mom-of-zohran-mamdani-aide-who-said-owning-a-home-fuels-white-supremacy-has-1-6m-house-in-tennessee/"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt; was a “desperate right-wing attack” and that the city was lucky to have her advocating for New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footage has captured the disastrous moment when multiple parents erupted into a massive fight during a Catholic youth basketball game last month in Staten Island, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violent courtside brawl unfolded on Dec. 20 at St. Teresa in Castleton Corners during a 6th-grade boys game between the school and Saint Clare, &lt;a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2026/01/weeks-after-melee-staten-island-officials-announce-new-rules-for-spectators-at-youth-basketball-games.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to SILive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was monitored by the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO), which oversees the parish-based sport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video obtained by the Staten Island Advance initially shows two moms locked in a heated exchange that quickly escalated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions boiled over when one shoved the other, sparking a furious exchange of chaotic punches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectators, other parents and school staff then rushed to the scene in an attempt to separate the two mothers, who had begun clutching each other by the hair, with one landing a relentless barrage of punches at the other’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Parents erupted into a massive fight during a 6th-grade boys basketball game on Dec. 20 at St. Teresa in Castleton Corners. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Silive/YouTube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several men finally pulled the two women apart, a separate fight erupted during the disruptive melee, the video shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos reignited as the women returned to each other, continuing their violent struggle amid the ongoing turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CYO County Director Michael Neely, the two women were parents, and some of those who became involved in the altercation were their family members, SILive reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neely added that the two women, along with the family members who became involved, have been suspended indefinitely from attending CYO games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two families got involved and, in the end, their families have been banned from CYO indefinitely,” Neely said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, leaders reportedly said altercations at Catholic Youth Organization games are typically handled on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="universal-promo__inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The mission was about the kids,” Fossella, whose children reportedly played CYO basketball, said during a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mission was about teaching them responsibility. The mission was about them having a good time: the kids. The kids are the center of this universe here. And every once in a while some spectators get out of control and ruin it for the kids and ruin it for everybody else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Penn State soccer coach Jeff Cook &lt;a href="https://gopsusports.com/news/2021/08/25/mens-soccer-adds-kuhn-mangione-as-vice-captains-for-2021-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;touted Mangione&lt;/a&gt;, who was named vice captain of the team in 2021, as having “made significant contributions to our Penn State men’s soccer program both on and off the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent the previous two seasons with FC Cincinnati 2 of MLS Next, an amateur league operated by Major League Soccer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="single__inline-module aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-primary-tag"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season, Mangione logged two goals and five assists over 28 appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He brings a balanced midfield profile to Brooklyn, with the engine to cover ground and the end product to impact matches in the final third,” his new team said in its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn FC will open its inaugural season competing for the USL Championship on March 8, facing Indy Eleven at Maimonides Park in Coney Island — approximately 6 miles from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/inside-notorious-nyc-jail-where-maduro-wife-are-being-held/"&gt;Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center,&lt;/a&gt; where Peter’s cousin Luigi is currently housed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of assassinating Thompson outside the health insurance company’s investor conference in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a five-day manhunt, he was apprehended inside an Altoona, Pa., McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Margaret Garnett this week backtracked on a prior ruling, electing to hold an evidentiary hearing to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/01/us-news/luigi-mangione-due-in-court-for-pivotal-hearing-on-backpack-and-may-wear-suit/"&gt;determine if Mangione’s backpack was lawfully seized&lt;/a&gt; and searched during the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has pushed for the death penalty in the Mangione case, which would mark the first Manhattan federal execution &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/feds-to-seek-death-penalty-for-luigi-mangione-ag-pam-bondi-announces/"&gt;in more than 70 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luigi faces a trove of charges, including federal, as his lawyers seek to prevent the death penalty. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;csuarez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnett set a tentative date of Sept. 8 to begin jury selection, as Mangione’s lawyers &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/20/us-news/luigi-mangione-death-penalty-case-should-be-tossed-defense-argues/"&gt;fight to avoid the death penalty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnett said last week that if death penalty charges are dropped, the trial could begin as early as Oct. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the federal charges proceed, Mangione’s trial could begin in January 2027, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s legal counsel has fought against capital punishment, arguing that the case has been turned into a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/20/us-news/luigi-mangione-death-penalty-case-should-be-tossed-defense-argues/"&gt;“Marvel-esque” production&lt;/a&gt;, which will negatively sway potential jurors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a show of force befitting a captured cartel chief or comic book villain, Mr. Mangione, at the time a 26-year-old who had never been in trouble with the law, was ‘perp walked’ before scores of television cameras and press reporters, surrounded by armed law enforcement officials in tactical SWAT gear and raid jackets,” his lawyers said in a 114-page Manhattan Federal Court filing in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges in both federal and New York state court, and also entered not guilty pleas in Pennsylvania to the weapons and related offenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An illegal immigrant from Afghanistan previously convicted of trying to kill his teenage sister for being a “bad Muslim girl” was arrested, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waheed Allah Mohammad, 39, was taken into custody on Jan. 1 in Rochester, New York, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad was convicted of first-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we say ICE is arresting the ‘worst of the worst,’ this is exactly what we mean,” said ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “We’re conducting targeted enforcement operations to arrest and remove convicted criminals like Mohammad who pose clear threats to their families, communities and states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Mohammad stabbed his sister several times during an argument where he called her a “bad Muslim girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said she disgraced his family by dressing immodestly and frequenting nightclubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lawfully entered the United States on May 24, 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, his attempted murder conviction violated the terms of his legal status, ICE said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was convicted in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2009, ICE entered Mohammad into removal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, an immigration judge ordered that he be deported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will remain in federal custody pending his deportation. &lt;/p&gt;
