That number includes both raccoons and feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid raccoons have also been discovered in Suffolk County this year, predominantly in the Amityville area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a rare but deadly disease that can be passed to humans by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have contact with a rabid animal but receive prompt treatment can avoid serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resurgence of rabies in Nassau County, with its high population density and after nearly a decade of absence, represents a serious and evolving public health concern," Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman said in a statement. "This declaration allows us to respond to prevent further spread and protect the health and safety of Nassau County residents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the declaration allows the county to secure resources and conduct activities to address and abate the threat, officials said. That includes spreading rabies vaccine baits in areas where infected animals have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is urged not to feed or touch wild animals, stray cats or dogs. In addition, it's important to make sure pets — including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses and livestock — are vaccinated against rabies, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Department of Health asks anyone whose pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal to contact them and report any dead, sick or abnormally acting animal by emailing rabies@nassaucountyny.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

But when the pediatrician walked in, the mood changed. “Praying?” she asked, her voice tight. The nurse and I stepped back while the pediatrician gently moved Maggie’s limbs, testing how much they could straighten or bend. While some tightness in the hips or knees can be normal for a newborn, Maggie’s joints were unusually tight and her limbs could not straighten all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pediatrician pointed out the rounded soles of Maggie’s feet. “A handful of genetic conditions can cause the shape of her feet. Most of them are fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"science/genetics","type":"Keyword","title":"Genetics"},{"id":"society/children","type":"Keyword","title":"Children"},{"id":"media/social-media","type":"Keyword","title":"Social media"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/21/daughter-health-mystery-rare-genetic-disorder","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I stared at her, unable to process the word “fatal” in connection to the brand new, six-pound person I’d brought into this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next seven days, I rarely slept. The children’s hospital put me up in a &lt;a href="https://rmhc.org/donate?c_src=paid&amp;amp;c_src2=25AORPMsearch_google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=skag&amp;amp;utm_medium=google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=18137358842&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRPtoQgoC6CZiFvnOViCEW5k9lpb&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3rnCBhBxEiwArN0QE9vNBl_qDYtTcGtcMgbBGoJllSmAiQTsnAcPX-fhBn2Civ-A3qUhPRoCbfIQAvD_BwE" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ronald McDonald house&lt;/a&gt; a mile away from the NICU, where Maggie had been transferred. Every three hours, I walked to the NICU to breastfeed and pump. I was anxious and scared, signing off on procedures and tests, and answering dozens of questions about my pregnancy, diet, lifestyle and family history. By the time Maggie left the hospital, she had been seen by neurology, genetics, internal medicine and orthopedics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then the results came: she had tested negative for the scary fatal conditions. The relief floored me. But she also tested negative for every other known diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Why are her joints stiff?” I asked her last doctor right before discharge. He shrugged and said, “We can only get to know her as an individual. Sometimes it is not a bad thing to see how unique each person really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I agreed that accepting my daughter’s differences was essential. But I worried that the physicians had missed something. For the next two months, I sat in front of the computer, flipping through Maggie’s 50-page medical chart and searching terms like “multiple joint contractures”, “vertical talus”, “high arched palate” and “micrognathia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eventually, I discovered pictures of children with similar limbs in medical journals and studies about arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC – an umbrella diagnosis describing infants born with multiple contracted joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I showed Maggie’s new pediatrician screenshots. The condition was incredibly rare, he said; in his 30-year career, he had met only three babies who looked like my daughter, all during his time as a military physician overseas. He referred us to the closest specialty clinic, which was five states away in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“She has a community. You just haven’t met them yet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I knew the trip would be daunting with an infant and Maggie’s two-year-old sibling in tow. But for the first time, I had some answers and knew where to look for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Six months later, Maggie and I arrived for her first appointment at the clinic. We saw five specialists, which took nine hours. Some mysteries were solved. I learned the term for her feet: “&lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Congenital_Vertical_Talus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rocker bottom&lt;/a&gt;”, the soles curving like the bottoms of cartoon boats. Surgery could guide them to grow flatter and arched, so she could learn to bear weight and eventually walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since birth, Maggie’s elbows had loosened, but her knees still didn’t flex all the way. We would need to take annual weeks-long trips to Philadelphia so the doctors could slowly stretch Maggie’s ankles and knees, wrap them in casts, saw off the casts a week later, stretch a little farther, and cast again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, we had no diagnosis. “What caused all this?” I asked the doctors. I was afraid to voice my other questions: &lt;em&gt;Will she walk or talk? How different will she be from her sibling? What decisions will I have to make? How will I know what is right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the United States, parents of the one in six children &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/child-development/about/developmental-disability-basics.html#:~:text=1%20in%206%2C%20or%20about%2017%25%2C%20of%20children%20aged%203%20through%2017" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;with developmental delays&lt;/a&gt; ask such questions every day. For the approximately&lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104235#:~:text=about%2030%20million%20people%E2%80%94half%20of%20them%20children" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 million children&lt;/a&gt; who have received a rare diagnosis, defined as one that affects &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/rare-diseases-fda#:~:text=on%20rare%20diseases?-,What%20is%20a%20rare%20disease?,drugs%20to%20treat%20rare%20diseases." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fewer than 200,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, the future is unknowable. Some diagnoses, like Maggie’s, are so rare that &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/rare-and-orphan-diseases" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they aren’t seen as profitable subjects&lt;/a&gt; for research funding. People with these “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1502161" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;orphan conditions&lt;/a&gt;” have to rely on themselves, their families, and grassroots endeavors to fund and discover treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating the maze of anxiety and “what ifs” felt relentless. Then I joined a Facebook group dedicated to the AMC specialist clinic we had visited, where parents shared pictures of their children, diagnoses, concerns, treatments and contact information for specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I introduced myself and posted pictures of Maggie. Immediately, Alyssa Wolfe, a mother and nurse, messaged me. She pointed out that her daughter, Delaney, had the same rocker bottom feet as Maggie, a rarity in the group. Our daughters both had one middle finger stuck flexed at the joint, and similar faces: a small chin, and a broad nose bridge that makes their eyes look farther apart than most babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4da723dd-340a-42ea-b464-5fbfd3c43211" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Maggie with her iPad, loaded with a program that she could use to talk.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Asha Dore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Delaney was three years older than Maggie. For years, I tracked Alyssa and Delaney’s progress through treatments, surgeries and diagnoses. Having another parent to talk to about major decisions was a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen Donohoe, a physical therapist, was also in the group, as she worked with many children with arthrogryposis. She had been gathering stories from patients like Maggie and Delaney because they “were different from the others with AMC, but they had so many of the same characteristics, it was impossible to ignore”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa had met Maureen at an arthrogryposis conference before I joined the group. “In an elevator, Maureen approached me, listing off Delaney’s attributes. I asked her if she somehow read my child’s medical chart. Maureen told me, ‘No,’ but she had been hypothesizing with a geneticist about a syndrome, and she thought Delaney had it,” Alyssa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After coming across six patients with these characteristics, Maureen had told Dr Judith Hall, a clinical geneticist and pediatrician, this might be a genetic anomaly worth studying. “After Dr Hall looked at her own notes, she called me and said, ‘I have 10,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Connecting with Alyssa and Maureen was the first major step in identifying Maggie’s condition. But what was the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As Maggie grew, her development continued to be markedly different from that of other kids her age. By the time she was three, she could scoot but not yet crawl. Most kids her age with AMC had been mobile for at least a year. But one day, in physical therapy, she suddenly stood with the help of a toy shopping cart. Then she learned to use a walker. Over the years Maureen noticed a similar trend with kids like Maggie. “They do their best weight-bearing and walking around preschool age,” she said. “When they get older, they seem to have a harder time maintaining a center of gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maggie was talking constantly, but her sounds were disorganized. Nobody could understand her. Most children with AMC alone had no speech problems at all. It was hard to find resources, but our speech therapist helped us get an iPad program that Maggie could use to talk. She’d press a button on a grid of images and common words, and the iPad would say the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her first sentence blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie was sitting at the dining room table eating breakfast while I washed dishes. “I need money,” her talker said in a mechanized child’s voice. I paused, holding a bowl. Maggie pressed the “talk” button again, and the sentence repeated. She pointed at my purse and threw her head back, guffawing. She’d made a joke. I said, “You need money!” over and over, laughing, nearly sobbing, dripping soapy water everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, Maggie was using her talker to ask for snacks and toys, to complain, to tell her new baby brother, “You’re cute!” At school, Maggie verbally repeated every word she or her friends pressed. By the end of the school year, the talker was gathering dust in our coat closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie’s limitations and sudden moments of progress surprised even the doctors who specialized in arthrogryposis. At every turn, I wanted to celebrate her success, but the gap widened between her and the other kids with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Isolating a genetic anomaly is a “diagnostic odyssey” that many families embark on, said Dr Michael Bamshad, head of genetic medicine in pediatrics at the University of Washington. “There’s all this data that sits locked away in medical records. A physician in one state may know of three similar cases, a physician in another state may know about five,” said Bamshad, “but there aren’t many ways for those families to find each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bamshad, his colleague Jessica X Chong and their colleagues have researched &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656649/#:~:text=Methods:%20Social%20networking%20among%20families%2C%20clinicians%2C%20and,conditions%2C%20particularly%20those%20with%20nonspecific%20phenotypic%20features." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the power of social media in genetic discovery&lt;/a&gt;. They launched a secure, free genetic information sharing site, &lt;a href="https://mygene2.org/MyGene2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MyGene2&lt;/a&gt;, in 2016. “Families and clinicians can share their genetic information to help them find answers,” said Chong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa and I input our daughters’ data and hoped for more information. But the waiting game was long, and we felt powerless. Alyssa recently described it to me as a three-part process: “In the beginning, parents are typically very active on social media, trying to understand their kid and hoping to give them as normal of a life as possible,” she said. Then, “sometime in elementary or middle school, their development stalls” and the focus shifts from “fixing” the issue to maintenance through puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can all be “very isolating”, she said. “Parents with typically developing kids often stop hanging out with you.” But “an acceptance stage” can come via social media groups like ours, which are “sometimes the only place to find connection and friends who understand”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2017, Catherine Paul-Fijten, a mother and molecular biologist who lives in Dubai, used Facebook groups to connect with parents whose kids resembled her daughter, Milou. I didn’t know about Milou yet, but she had the same physical traits as Maggie, who was five by then. Milou’s doctors had located a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;difference&lt;/a&gt; on the ZC4H2 gene shortly after birth, and Catherine organized a meeting of doctors and geneticists – including Maureen and Dr Bamshad – to review the current, albeit limited, research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen sat next to Bamshad, scrolling through pictures of Maggie, Delaney and other children with rocker bottom feet and tiny chins. Bamshad suggested that we both report our daughter’s symptoms on MyGene2 and apply for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, the diagnosis was confirmed: Maggie also had an anomaly of the ZC4H2 gene. At the time, fewer than 50 people with a similar genetic difference had ever been identified. Catherine used personal resources to start a foundation to research the impacts of this new genetic diagnosis, updating a new, dedicated Facebook group regularly with insights. The diagnosis gave us a sense of belonging through the shared goal of understanding our kids and learning how to help them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dramatic impact of online support groups for children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470259/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5350458/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; for more than 20 years. Online information sharing among parents has been found to strengthen treatment and mental health support &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998788/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316198/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;families &lt;/a&gt;and children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15658796/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721213001092?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; rare &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt; as well as more common diagnoses like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647109/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jpedres.org/articles/how-parents-of-children-with-cancer-seek-information-through-online-communities-a-netnography-study/doi/jpr.galenos.2019.48378?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the ZC4H2 gene difference is rare, research into rare conditions is crucial – “not just for the people who have that diagnosis – but for humanity as a whole”, Catherine said. That’s because “much of what we know about the function of the human genome comes from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases”, said Bamshad, citing examples including common heart conditions and vaccine research. “What we’ve learned about rare diseases helps us understand the genetic and molecular basis of common conditions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ZC4H2 group has nearly 200 members, though nearly 250 people with this condition have now been identified globally. Because of their stories, I was prepared. In 2023, at the beginning of sixth grade, Maggie suddenly presented with severe scoliosis, and I knew she would probably need a full spinal fusion because I’d heard about related complications from our ZC4H2 community. I shared this information with Maggie’s spinal surgeon, as well as a list of other surgeons who had had to manage these complications, and she formed a pre-emptive plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;During Maggie’s spinal surgery, I let myself get lost in the labyrinthian halls of the hospital for hours, cellphone in one hand, operating room pager in the other. As with her previous 10-plus surgeries, I didn’t allow myself to imagine what was happening or what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As I stood in the hallway, I scrolled through encouraging comments and messages from Alyssa, Catherine and others. Despite our different jobs, family culture and background, we’d collaborated with doctors, scientists, physical and speech therapists – and each other – for more than a decade. Their support didn’t guarantee a perfect future for my daughter, but their generosity was a profound gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The operating room pager went off. My phone rang. The charge nurse told me my daughter was waking up, that surgery had been a breeze. I rushed to the recovery room, tapping the app to share the news while I waited for Maggie to be wheeled in. At the top of the feed, a new member had posted about her child’s fresh diagnosis, her questions, her fears. I abandoned my own update to type the words that changed the course of my life and Maggie’s childhood: &lt;em&gt;Welcome! You are not alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQX1ZXR3RjS1M5b25oWkd0QW85QldnblBXVmZsQlB2S2FFbkREazl6d3luc3Yya0wwRlYwbmpMRWZKZG5oTnNWelFwTmFqN2JaREptMGNIS2t3SXdHMjFidmk0V1dTMjhGRkFUMEJkbjhCeU9yeHN0U05reU9CYkJyYjVFM1VxYUNYenBxMEt4T3QwSjNoTUpZNUln</guid></item><item><title>美国著名的反vaxxer说他感染了麻疹，然后回家了-卫报 | Prominent US anti-vaxxer says he caught measles and traveled back home - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UaXdVdmtRb3I4ZERCLXplcTJXMFNPZkVWd2IzSWxELXdjRVQyME8xM0tVbVZDclFJRUpQTHRPZGxRVFA4V05ycUhhR2xYYS1vVUtQQUZlRWhIVU1jRmdMZ2ZNbWNvVy1HeC12eGtpWXlHTVRMRXJ1bkM3Y1NtUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the US says he caught measles in west &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and traveled back home – but he seems not to have alerted local authorities of his illness, which means the highly transmissible virus may have spread onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is a threat to people who are unvaccinated or immune-compromised. In anti-vaccine communities, it may quickly find a foothold and spread largely under the radar before ballooning into an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/texas","type":"Keyword","title":"Texas"},{"id":"society/mmr","type":"Keyword","title":"MMR"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/21/anti-vaxxer-measles-texas","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Brian Hooker, chief scientific officer of Children’s Health Defense, filmed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/measles-spread-vaccine-misinformation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas in March with the parents of the six-year-old child who died from measles – the first measles death in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The video promoted several dangerous myths about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, a virus that can be deadly and can cause lifelong harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker and Polly Tommey, an anti-vaccine film-maker with Children’s Health Defense, also interviewed other Mennonite families in west Texas. And they visited the medical office of Ben Edwards while patients and Edwards himself had symptomatic measles, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker then traveled home to Redding, California, and developed measles symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Full disclosure, 18 days after visiting Seminole, Texas, sitting in a measles clinic and being exposed to Doctor Ben with the measles, I got the measles. So cool,” Hooker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker, Tommey, and Edwards spoke on a &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6tml4t-episode-178-measles-outbreak-update.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch on May 22. This news has not been previously reported by other outlets. Children’s Health Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiry for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker doesn’t appear to have sought healthcare or testing to confirm his symptoms were measles and not another infection. Other viral and bacterial infections may cause rashes, which is why medical providers need to conduct tests to confirm measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without confirmation of his illness being measles, Hooker may spread misinformation about the illness – including what helps to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker says he turned to the alternative treatments hailed by anti-vaccine activists. Edwards had given him cod liver oil and vitamin C supplements in Gaines county, Hooker said, noting: “I stuck them in my luggage, and that’s what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if this case was measles, by not seeking confirmation testing and notifying officials, Hooker may have contributed to onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not clear if his first symptoms appeared after 18 days, or if he developed other symptoms – runny nose, cough, fever, watery eyes – and then a rash after 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After a person is exposed to measles, the virus usually incubates for 11 to 12 days before respiratory symptoms appear, followed by a rash two to four days later. A person is considered infectious four days before the rash appears and remains infectious until four days after it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If Hooker’s illness was measles, “it sounds like my worst nightmare as an infectious disease doc,” said Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at University of California San Francisco. “For all we know, there’s a trail of measles, like bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In areas with no known cases, health providers might not immediately suspect measles, he said: “Many people probably didn’t know they had it. There could have been people who were ill with pneumonia, who went into the hospital and no one diagnosed it. It’s very, very hard to diagnose because we haven’t seen that much of it. But of course, we’re seeing a lot more of it now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are other indications that the actual number of cases from the Texas outbreak is higher than the official count, Chin-Hong said – with three confirmed deaths, experts might expect a case count closer to 3,000, instead of the 762 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and 95 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, medical providers alert local or state health officials when a patient tests positive for measles. Health officials then conduct contact tracing to notify anyone who came into contact with the patient, including other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A representative for the Shasta county health department, serving the area where Hooker &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e-8918348/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he lives, said there have been no confirmed cases of measles reported this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are no cases of measles in Shasta county, and we have had no notice of any confirmed cases of measles this year,” said Jules Howard, community education specialist with the Shasta County Health &amp;amp; Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to know when a region has even a single case so resources can be diverted to the area to stop transmission, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most important part of those efforts is contact tracing and vaccinating anyone who is vulnerable – especially infants, pregnant people, and immune-compromised people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker is a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine community. He testified on Tuesday before a US Senate committee in its first-ever “vaccine injury” hearing, attempting to link MMR vaccination to autism – despite several studies showing no relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker said he became sick with measles despite being vaccinated as a child. But because he was born before 1989, he probably only received one dose of the MMR vaccine, which is 93% effective at stopping illness. Vaccination may also make breakthrough illness milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When anti-vaccine messages keep parents from getting their children vaccinated, “I think the damage is immediate,” Chin-Hong said, before adding that it “goes beyond the measles outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough and the flu are also surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is like the poster child, but it’s about a way of life that we’ve taken for granted in the last few decades that is threatened,” Chin-Hong said. “The fact that [they] are questioning it on a public stage means that a lot more people who might have trusted their clinicians are questioning it more now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US eliminated measles in 2000, but the nation could lose that status if there is sustained transmission for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re going back in time,” Chin-Hong said. “We have to relearn all of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UaXdVdmtRb3I4ZERCLXplcTJXMFNPZkVWd2IzSWxELXdjRVQyME8xM0tVbVZDclFJRUpQTHRPZGxRVFA4V05ycUhhR2xYYS1vVUtQQUZlRWhIVU1jRmdMZ2ZNbWNvVy1HeC12eGtpWXlHTVRMRXJ1bkM3Y1NtUQ</guid></item><item><title>抗癌药物能否成为阿尔茨海默氏症治疗的未来？ -雅虎主页 | Could cancer drugs be the future of Alzheimer's treatment? - Yahoo Home</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With few treatments available to stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have turned to cancer drugs as a potential means of walking back cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s cases are rising in the United States and worldwide due to an aging population, but there is no cure for the disease. Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have frequently failed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:abandoned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:popular weight loss drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients. They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’ database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In &lt;span&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/span&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important.

Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" target="_blank"&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-256e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d7948" class="body-graf"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" target="_blank"&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28236e" class="body-graf"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a6385" class="body-graf"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66ce04" class="body-graf"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5fb8e" class="body-graf"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e3b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed88b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd94e7" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://letrozole" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" target="_blank"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53b57b" class="body-graf"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9763dd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73ee98" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90acd4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f27e1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e31c" class="body-graf"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986e4" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ab613" class="body-graf"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-754b37" class="body-graf"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-671ed8" class="body-graf"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ea4a6" class="body-graf"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important. Letrozole can cause hot flashes and irinotecan can cause severe diarrhea. Both drugs can lead to nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073381" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“These drugs have huge side effects, so you need to always balance and figure out whether those types of side effects would be amenable to somebody with Alzheimer’s,” Sirota said. “It’s not that it’s a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRnp4enNZeHh1Rk5iNjJHVXd5OE8wQklNVk44S3Zwck41dXVnVVJoYXhnQ1V0d2xCRklhNUZSTFRwT1ZqQXNyaXN6T3ZCUW5HaGxCdXZYUW1jOUxIMUpYbUs4THRYTVhhYVBXUUN4bUxHNkVkbnRENGFRSkwxcS1VaVNTYlgxZThNc3ZCbHhabHV0NmxHQnhnQUJR0gFWQVVfeXFMUENMazRrb3BMM2NVS2pnTTFRS2daR3hyTnFmLTJRXzRPU1lRWDk3ZWZVLUpzeGFNdzJvclNsOUhvZUNGTG9oYzI5MWVqSDY3V3pFdGVodkE</guid></item><item><title>隔日禁食真的有助于减肥吗？ - AOL.com | Does alternate-day fasting really help with weight loss? - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5XTGxlX3piNDd5dHVOakZzTjZheHh3T2VQZUpoNllqYjZ5NFYxYXdrYUxXT01oamNhLVZsMVYtcjBMVmdKbnNIZldlN3VocjI0THpudW82LWh2aGdMUU5nUE1JSWZXRk5uamk1RHJfb2VDRk1rZzNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does the research on alternate-day fasting back the hype?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was reviewed by Brian Tanzer, nutritionist and Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at The Vitamin Shoppe. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternate-day fasting (ADF) has been gaining popularity as a helpful way to not only lose weight, but also experience a range of other health benefits. But are you really expected to go full days without eating &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its name suggests completely going without food every other day, studies on ADF typically involve eating about 25 percent of your usual intake one day, followed by a “feast day” of eating as much food as you like. The daily see-saw approach is still restrictive, yet for some, there’s appeal to a diet that doesn’t tell you what you can and can’t eat, doesn’t require macro tracking, and doesn’t say “kitchen’s closed” at any particular hour of the day. The only thing you need to track with alternate-day fasting is your calories: You simply cut them down to 25 percent of your normal intake every other day, then eat how you like on opposite days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not right for everyone, but if you’re wondering whether or not ADF lives up to its reputation for weight loss and other health perks, we’ve gathered the research and asked the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and metabolism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most touted benefits of ADF is its impact on metabolism. According to weight-loss dietitian and nutrition writer Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, ADF’s influence on metabolism is not unlike that of a keto diet. “Alternate-day fasting can support metabolic health by giving the body time to enter ketosis,” she says. “This is a process where your body starts to use fat as its primary energy source, rather than carbohydrates, and typically starts after at least 18 hours of fasting.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224025161" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that ketosis may help preserve muscle mass, which in turn can support a more active metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic boost ADF may give is no small feat for body composition. A&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049520302006" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 systematic review and meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who followed this eating pattern for six months had reduced body mass index (BMI), body weight, and total cholesterol. That’s a pretty impressive combo for metabolic health—and one of the more promising alternate-day fasting benefits supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of ADF for metabolism don’t stop there. “It may also be beneficial for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7138754/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest ADF can reduce fasting insulin levels more than daily calorie restriction, though results are still mixed and may depend on the individual,” Mitri says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored ADF’s effect on heart disease risk markers, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, Mitri points out. “However, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are mixed on this, and more recent research suggests ADF does not have any positive impact on heart disease,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every research study has shown dramatic results for metabolism, either. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that people who tried ADF didn’t experience more weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic measures than those who restricted calories every day, or even those who had no dietary intervention at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shocker here: Burning fat and preserving muscle could lead to weight loss. Though studies have had varying results, some show that the back-and-forth of alternate-day fasting is more than the sum of its caloric parts. “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.586036/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows people following ADF can lose 3-7% of their body weight in 8-12 weeks, along with reductions in body fat, waist circumference, and visceral fat,” says Amy Davis, M.S., R.D. These are some of the most sought-after alternate-day fasting benefits, especially for those with weight-related health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled with diets that pigeonhole your eating into narrow food categories or time windows, Davis says alternate-day fasting can be a smart choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who might benefit most include people who struggle with moderation, those who don’t like tracking food or macros, people who like large meals and find portion control difficult, and individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nadiia Borovenko / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want to live longer? Some research shows that ADF could promote longevity, though Davis cautions that many studies have been conducted on animals, and more research is needed. Three processes that could help explain why alternate-day fasting may support longevity are autophagy, metabolic switching, and enhanced cellular function. “Autophagy is the process of cellular repair that can enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative damage,” Davis explains. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509423/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that fasting triggers these helpful activities known for extending lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic switching, on the other hand, is the cycling between feasting and fasting that’s the hallmark of ADF. “Fasting periods deplete glycogen and trigger fat oxidation, which boosts metabolic flexibility,” Davis says. Some researchers believe a flexible metabolism may play a role in supporting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, supporting cellular health and metabolic efficiency is often considered beneficial for longevity. A fasting-based eating plan has been studied for its potential to influence markers associated with aging and metabolic function, though it’s not currently recommended as a treatment for any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important not to offset the potential benefits of fasting with the food you eat on your “off” days. “While ‘feast day’ may sound like a free-for-all, the quality of the foods consumed on those days matters, especially for longevity,” Davis says. “Certain foods have been linked to longevity, including fiber-rich plant-based options like vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts.” On the other hand, a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been associated with negative health outcomes, including markers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538973/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied to a shorter lifespan.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied to a shorter lifespan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sasithorn Phuapankasemsuk / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who shouldn’t try alternate-day fasting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any diet, ADF isn’t right for everyone. “Certain individuals should avoid alternate-day fasting,” says Davis. Those with a history of eating disorders should steer clear, she says, since the restrictive nature of fasting can be a trigger. “Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and teens should also avoid ADF, since they need consistent nutrition to support growth and development.” Lastly, those taking insulin or other diabetes meds should avoid fasting to prevent hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re OK flexing your willpower muscles, alternate-day fasting could be your sweet spot for a trimmer figure, higher metabolism, longer life, and more. Just be sure to check in with your healthcare provider before starting a new diet, especially one that involves fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT OUR EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., is a weight-loss dietitian, nutrition writer, and owner of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melissa Mitri Nutrition.

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000u3b6n05mudj93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000z3b6nd2j0kcik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200133b6n72j4frno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200143b6nrrqr11fi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200153b6nhnt9pxw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200163b6n8m32g530@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000j3b6nark07ipt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000k3b6nl555o66e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.

            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Out-of-Touch Adult’s Guide to Kid Culture, where you have joined my new religious group, just by reading these words. This week, we're taking a look at an online cult that got a little too real, asking why young people are branding themselves with liquid nitrogen, and discussing the generational stare-down being enacted across the counters of retail establishments all over the country. Plus a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; viral video about the dangers of jumbotrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-children-of-the-waning-star-an-online-cult"&gt;Is Children of the Waning Star an online cult? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your child says they've joined a cult called "Children of the Waning Star," it's not as bad as it seems.  The online group began on July 11, when TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Gigi Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; announced she was starting a cult, "and you're all going to be a part of it." It was obviously a joke, but the video took off on the platform, earning millions of views, and before long, the cult began picking up steam. Jarvis and her followers chose the name "Children of the Waning Star," picked some special cult symbols, and declared new holidays. Jarvis even added "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/video/7526461163597499662" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;cult leader&lt;/a&gt;" to her resume. But then the blowback started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commenters informed Jarvis that cults are &lt;em&gt;not something you should joke about.&lt;/em&gt; Others, like this "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;pagan witch,&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@char.char_slide/video/7527026025599864078" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;posted videos&lt;/a&gt; about how the Waning Star was "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;spiraling out of control&lt;/a&gt;" or &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;becoming a real cult.&lt;/a&gt; So Jarvis, less than a week after she started her group, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/photo/7528239581473393933" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;announced she was shutting&lt;/a&gt; down the project. A week from cult to apology might be the world record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand why stopped, but I think it's a shame. Jarvis clearly wasn't trying to be a cult leader for &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, and Children of the Waning Star isn't the first (or the 10,000th) parody religion ever created. There's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Church of the Subgenius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Pastafarians&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism?ref=highexistence.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Discordian Society,&lt;/a&gt; and many more. None of these "spiraled out of control" or become "real" cults, even though they've been around for decades. Instead, they serve a real purpose by giving people a way to think and talk about unusual belief systems, and maybe provide tools to recognize the methods of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; authoritarian groups so they can be avoided.  Also: I really liked that Waning Star chose everything democratically. It would have been interesting to see the TikTok collective define and codify its spiritual beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-freeze-branding"&gt;What is "freeze branding"?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_brand" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Freeze branding,&lt;/a&gt; or cryo branding, is a method of using cryogenic materials, usually liquid nitrogen, to mark livestock. It's thought to be less painful and damaging than branding with heat. It was first practiced in 1960s, and it took all the way until 2021 for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8166665/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;a case of human freeze branding to be recorded in medical literature&lt;/a&gt;. The procedure has been gaining enough traction among body modification fans online lately for doctors to&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt; issue stern warnings against the practice&lt;/a&gt;. Although it doesn't seem that widespread. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are not a horse," dermatologist Dr. Andrea Suarez (known online as &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Dray&lt;/a&gt;) reminds us &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;in this TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, "This can result in a full thickness burn that puts you at risk for a deep infection called cellulitis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7494792376762862890"&gt;
    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dray sure is a &lt;em&gt;downer&lt;/em&gt;, but I assume she's right, and that no one should ever brand themself with liquid nitrogen because it's super, super bad—but I get why people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. The effect on cattle is cool: Freeze branding (animals) destroys pigmentation in hair follicles, resulting in white hair and/or white skin in the shape of the brand. There isn't much serious discussion online about how/if it's possible to cold brand people safely, but this video from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aD8w9_1VXzs" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;another online doctor&lt;/a&gt; reveals that doctors use liquid nitrogen regularly, so it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to cold brand people without disastrous consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-gen-z-stare"&gt;What is the "Gen-Z Stare?"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "Gen Z stare" is popping up all over &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/genzstare" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/what-is-the-gen-z-stare-all-about-the-latest-term-dividing-the-internet-11772963" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;non&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/gen-z-stare-latest-tiktok-170034069.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/07/17/gen-z-stare/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. It refers to the blank expression that is supposedly common among people between the ages of 13 and 28 years old, noticed especially often among &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6YXLBjW/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retail workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gen Z, it is said, responds to boiler-plate greetings and small talk with an inscrutable stare instead of a smile or nod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not a new term—&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghan.alessi/video/7397202641966746911" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this video explaining the phenomena is nearly a year old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;— it has gone &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; viral lately. Is this a real shift in cultural behavior, or a trendy age-based online carping campaign? It's hard to say when it comes to something as amorphous as people online reporting, "the barista looks at me funny when I order Starbucks," but it feels more like the "older generation" (Millennial) overblowing a small trait of Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of past generational moral panics, like &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-endanger-casual-dining-restaurants-2017-5" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Millennials killing casual dining&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and 100 other things), &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/the-waves/2022/10/youve-been-trained-to-distrust-womens-voices" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vocal fry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkem" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jenkem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gol-53Be2k0" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rainbow parties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/woke-m-ms-and-8-other-ridiculous-moral-panics-through-1850028075" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;switchblades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the "overly jaunty" rhythm of Bing Crosby's "&lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/639027/bbc-banned-bing-crosby-song" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deep in the Heart of Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;." (To be fair, that shit is fucking &lt;em&gt;jaunty&lt;/em&gt;.)

&lt;p&gt;I took a more &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-is-gen-z-stare" target="_blank"&gt;in-depth look at the Gen Z stare here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="viral-video-of-the-week-affair-caught-on-coldplay-jumbotron"&gt;Viral video of the week: Affair caught on Coldplay jumbotron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7527910323681070367"&gt;
    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rare for the entire internet to collectively agree on something, but this week, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, from Baby Boomers to Gen A, shared the same reaction to a viral video: "I'm glad I'm not &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; people." No one needs it explained, I guess, but you don't get more viral than this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video in question was shot at a recent Coldplay concert in Massachusetts. It begins innocently enough: The camera pans to a couple embracing tenderly, and the crowd cheers. But things go south quickly when the pair realize they’re on the Jumbotron and freak out. Their awkward attempts to duck and hide only draw attention to the drama. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin even narrates the moment: “Oh, look at these two,” he says from the stage, before pausing and adding, "Either they’re having an affair, or they’re just very shy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first one, Chris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet quickly identified the couple as Andy Byron, the CEO of tech company called Astronomer who is extremely married to someone who isn't Astronomer's "chief people officer" Kristin Cabot.In the following days, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/business/ex-employee-of-tech-ceo-andy-byron-claims-he-was-a-toxic-boss-before-coldplay-drama/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;former employees came out to shit talk their old boss&lt;/a&gt;, Astronomer's board launched an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/astronomer-andy-byron-coldplay-kiss-cam.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, more than &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/coldplay-kiss-cam-astronomer" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;15 million people read about the event online&lt;/a&gt; (that's as much exposure as the Diddy trial had), and Byron's wife &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/entertainment/astronomer-ceo-andy-byrons-wife-had-happy-family-photos-on-facebook-until-his-affair-was-exposed/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;took the family photos off Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As amusing as all this is, I can't help but feel sympathy for those involved. Imagine that everyone you know—your friends, your family, your co-workers, your second grade teacher—has video proof that you attended a Coldplay concert.&lt;/p&gt;

However, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24280-triclosan" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, triclosan can still be found in some toothpastes, deodorants, cosmetics and detergents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QNB4GKQUNVFZLMEMDLV4PXM4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recent study followed 347 mothers and their children from pregnancy through the children’s 12th birthdays. During that period, urinary triclosan concentrations in mother-child pairs were assessed through age 5, and then again at 8 and 12 years old. From ages 6 months to 12 years, caregivers (via survey) were asked about any allergy symptoms, including eczema, allergic rhinitis and wheezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3IMMZFABFBGDLEQUDJ5ZRK3IFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children with double the urinary triclosan levels were 12 percent more likely to show hay fever symptoms, such as sneezing or congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="54QZWY2VLFD4NIJJ6PJQ5Q5Z4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, the child’s sex appeared to influence the risk. Among boys, each twofold increase in the level of triclosan found in the mother’s urine during pregnancy was associated with almost double (1.9 times) the child’s risk of reporting allergic rhinitis symptoms, including sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes, the researchers reported. For that same increase in urinary triclosan, the risk of a female child reporting allergic rhinitis symptoms was 9 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGO6J6TOSZAD5IBMUERNLETXSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The reason behind the triclosan-eczema association remained unclear. “One hypothesis we have is that triclosan kills off helpful bacteria that live on our skin and in our bodies that help us form healthy immune responses,” said Hannah Laue, the first author of the study and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FQMWQR2EDJDJ5DCRUCSEDZI4PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article is part of The Post’s “Big Number” series, which takes a brief look at the statistical aspect of health issues.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out," says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/07/1236721063/the-world-is-facing-a-major-cholera-vaccine-shortage-amid-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trouble in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meeting this target.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries," says Russell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;any country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly how much of a 'game changer'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And one thing is clear to her. "You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak]," she says. "Vaccine can really be a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a "game changer" these stockpiles are — until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/about-us/our-people-and-structure/our-people/nick-scott/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nick Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the&lt;em&gt; British Medical Journal — Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's quite an amazing thing," said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?" says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/360/ruth-karron" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ruth Karron&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. "And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/investing/funding/resource-mobilisation/Gavi-Investment-Opportunity-2026-2030.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;financial planning documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott's team also found that speed really matters. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be," he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months," Russell says. "If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Everything is up for question'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01240-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/06/25/g-s1-74554/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. announcing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to "re-earn the public trust." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So obviously, everything is up for question," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rate at which our bodies age and wear down doesn't necessarily match our actual age, and the differences can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;help predict lifespan&lt;/a&gt; and disease risk. Now, researchers have developed a new tool for assessing biological age from a single brain scan taken halfway through our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool, put together by an international team of scientists, is based on a dataset of 1,037 people born in Dunedin in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. The health of these individuals has been carefully tracked over time, giving scientists a useful long-term database of stats that reflect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;the body's actual age&lt;/a&gt; – not how many birthdays have passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the researchers used those stats to assess biological aging, and train a tool they've called DunedinPACNI – Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging. That sums up its function, which is to match aging to markers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-breakthrough-brain-scans-predict-disease-up-to-9-years-early?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Breakthrough: Brain Scans Predict Disease Up to 9 Years Early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has the potential to quickly assess the body's age to a good degree of accuracy, and from there health and disease risks, including the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;chances of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than needing multiple tests over time, just a single brain scan is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ahmad Hariri from Duke University in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DunedinPACNI takes in 99 key brain measurements to make its assessment, including the thickness of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; – which affects language and thinking – and the volume of gray matter in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had developed DunedinPACNI, they tested it on a variety of data from other health research projects, covering more than 50,000 people in total. It was shown to work well at estimating biological age, and at predicting future health problems such as cognitive impairment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;and heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a tool that offers perfect accuracy each time, but it scores as well as or better than current biological age assessment methods, the researchers say. What's more, it was shown to be useful across different demographic and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/providing-cash-to-low-income-mothers-puts-their-baby-s-brains-on-a-new-wavelength"&gt;socioeconomic groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The link between aging of the brain and body is pretty compelling," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hariri. "It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168307" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3.jpg" alt="Brain scan differences" class="wp-image-168307 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3-600x315.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168307" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how brain structure matched biological age.

Changes in diet or exercise at that point could make a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are particularly interested in predicting the risk of the various types of dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. As people live longer across the world, rates of dementia are increasing, and the best way to tackle the condition could be to stop it developing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really think of it as hopefully being a key new tool in forecasting and predicting risk for diseases, especially  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="168303" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and related dementias, and also perhaps gaining a better foothold on progression of disease," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hariri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00897-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not into the idea of eating a raw banana peel? That’s understandable. But with the right prep and thoroughly washing the peels, they can be surprisingly versatile and tasty.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;: Boil the peel to soften it, then blend it into your smoothie with fruit, yogurt, and honey to mask bitterness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea: &lt;/strong&gt;Try boiling a peel in water for 10 minutes, straining it, and sipping it before bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baked goods&lt;/strong&gt;: Puree boiled or frozen peel and add it to banana bread, muffins, or pancakes for extra fiber and nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soups and curries: &lt;/strong&gt;Simmer the banana peel, then use that liquid to fortify soups and curries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Pulled pork”&lt;/strong&gt;: Shred ripe peels, sauté with onions, spices, and BBQ sauce, and use in sliders or tacos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chips&lt;/strong&gt;: Slice, season, and bake the peels for a crunchy snack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

These are tales of recovery, but also of the need for vigilance. For people experiencing mental illness, treatment is not about a cure, but effective management of life as it is. Whether through medicine, therapy or other support, people experiencing an intolerable crisis can find a way back. They must only take a step toward those who want to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;One inspiring story stands out. Years ago, just a few miles through the Itasca County woods where we both live, I met a great musician and a kindred spirit in the study of Iron Range history. At first, I knew nothing about his private battle with mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;As a kid in the 1990s and early 2000s, Sam Miltich became a self-taught jazz guitar phenomenon.

It’s about learning to trust the process, be gentle with yourself, and keep going even when it’s tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For the days when you feel like you should be further along. Save this for when the in-between feels heavy—and if you’re up for it, how’s your journey really feeling lately?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her post really resonated with other users, who left hundreds of comments about how they feel they are in a strange grey area of their jab journey, even if they have lost enormous amounts of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TikTokker @Swedish_Sandra was inundated with messages from other users 'in the middle' of their journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra is one of the thousands of people currently in the 'middle' of their weight loss journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'The middle is so hard, I have lost ten stone, which is a massive achievement but because I started out at 26 stone, it doesn’t look like the massive transformation I see on other people.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another added: 'The middle is hard. I’ve dropped 54 lbs but I still feel and see a fat girl in the mirror. Certain body parts bother me so much more now than they did before.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were scores of similar messages from other people who had found themselves not feeling familiar with their new, evolving, bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'80lbs with 40 to go, it’s great but it’s so odd to see my stomach now that loose skin is starting to take effect. I don’t feel like my body matches me and everything I do at all ,' said one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others admitted that they were finding this period 'soul crushing' and 'boring' as their final goal 'seems so very far away'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Middle is where I think we really do the work,. It’s triggering, falling into negative feelings and not giving up is the hard bit.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra, who has not revealed how much weight she has lost since starting on Mounjaro around five months ago, responded in the comments, and encouraged her fellow jabbers to keep pushing on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote:  'I completely get that, that initial excitement has died down but you’re not at goal weight yet. Sometimes it feels dull and slow. But those boring moments are the real, steady progress that doesn’t always get the spotlight, even though it’s what really lasts.'&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32ra001f3b6he6i8vunf@published"&gt;A few days ago a friend sent me the link to a porn video that stars the (recently) ex-girlfriend of a mutual good friend. The video is clearly shot in private, and although it shows her face it doesn’t have her name on it. This girl behaved really badly and completely shattered my friend’s heart, and while I don’t want to believe he would put something like this online, he is so hurt that it’s not outside the realm of possibility. She would lose her job and her career if this video was found, and she comes from a very conservative family. My questions: What are my obligations here? Do I ask my friend about it? Contact the ex? Part of me wishes I could forget that I saw it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="210" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32rm001i3b6h887rl3et@published"&gt;In my day people took sexy Polaroids of each other then hid them in the sock drawer. After a bad breakup, they took the pictures out of the gym sock and burned them. It’s too bad that one can no longer memorialize one’s hotness with such nonchalance. As my colleague Emily Bazelon&lt;a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html"&gt; recently described&lt;/a&gt;, this new plague of revenge porn is ruining lives and there is currently little legal recourse. (California just passed a law making&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/01/california-brown-anti-revenge-porn-bill/2906305/"&gt; posting such material a misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt;.) I talked to expert&lt;a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=028"&gt; Danielle Citron&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and author of the forthcoming book, Hate 3.0, about what can be done for this woman. First of all, contact your friend. If indeed he is the perpetrator, you should tell him that you have now seen the video. Tell him you know his ex did him wrong, but he should not compound the wrongdoing by exacting such vicious revenge. Citron says if he posted to a site where he controls his content, he could simply take down the video. Let’s hope it hasn’t been more widely disseminated and that her name hasn’t gotten attached. But if he gave it to a revenge porn website, then unfortunately he’s really lost control of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sa001r3b6hjwawcllb@published"&gt;You should also contact the ex-girlfriend. She’s entitled to know the bad news, which has the potential for painful professional and personal consequences. Citron says that if the video was a selfie, the woman would own the copyright. In that case it would be worth it for her to hire a lawyer to write a letter to the site operator where it’s being posted without her permission. But its being taken down is far from assured. If the woman is sure that the images were posted by her ex, Citron laid out other legal avenues she could explore, such as filing a civil claim of infliction of emotional distress or seeking criminal harassment action be taken against him. But Citron notes pursuing a civil lawsuit would be expensive and that law enforcement has taken a lax attitude toward these cases. Sadly, because of technology, people need to be aware when giving sexual photographs or videos of themselves to a paramour that love may die, but the images could live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

As I married a year ago, we field endless questions about when we’re going to have kids. My brother just had a baby. His sibling just had a baby. Going on Facebook is an endless parade of their kids from all of our relatives. Discussions are focused solely around their kids, then are turned to us. I keep saying, “We’re happily child-free,” but I’m losing my resolve. I’m constantly surrounded by something I’ll never get to have, but I don’t know how to broach the conversation with our families. I’m afraid the fertility-happy will try and tell us we just haven’t been trying long enough or that God will give us a baby when he sees fit. Based on our finances and the frequency of things falling through, adoption is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32s4001o3b6hr1ixa8vu@published"&gt;The only time I went through the X-ray machine at the airport, I miscarried the only pregnancy I’ve ever had. Since then, I’ve “opted out” (so has my husband, in solidarity) as we’ve been continually trying to get pregnant in the years since. Last time I flew, the TSA agent roughly groped my vagina and labia, and I had a panic attack. I’ve avoided flying since.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32s9001q3b6hi0ofvfv5@published"&gt;Further research about what exactly you’re exposed to when you get an airport X-ray might help set your mind at ease if you’re balking at the thought of another invasive pat-down. The timing of your last miscarriage is terrible, and your reluctance at the thought of getting X-rayed again is understandable, but the energy of the X-ray beam of an airport scanner is very low and does not penetrate the skin. According to the &lt;a href="http://hps.org/"&gt;Health Physics Society&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to radiation safety,&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sr00213b6hqo00f0tn@published"&gt;There is an American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard stating that people-scanning devices should expose an individual to no more than 0.25 microsievert per screening (one screening procedure generally consists of two scans). The two primary companies that sell people screeners say that their devices expose people to half that amount of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sb001s3b6hwy0bfir2@published"&gt;For perspective, 0.25 microsievert is also received by flying about a minute and a half (cosmic radiation during commercial flight exposes fliers to about 10 microsievert per hour). It is also received by living for 40 minutes (natural background radiation exposes people to about 0.35 microsievert per hour)…The American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard took into account the varying sensitivity of different groups of people who might be scanned. The authors first looked at a number of reports and published studies on the health effects of radiation. They then chose the 0.25 microsievert dose level to ensure that children and pregnant individuals can be safely scanned with these devices. The x-ray scanner uses a very low-energy and low-intensity radiation, so that an embryo/fetus is not exposed to any radiation that could possibly increase the developmental risks of radiation to the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32ro001k3b6hmc3yml5r@published"&gt;Getting informed is always a helpful bulwark against panic, but as a nervous flyer myself, I know it’s not always helpful to know something is safe when your brain is convinced you’re in danger. Learn more about anxiety treatments—anything from deep-breathing exercises to &lt;em&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/em&gt; —that you can perform on yourself when you’re feeling cornered in the security line. You can also apply for TSA Pre-Check, which may only require you to go through an old-school metal detector. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

And for the third time, my mom pressured me to name her after my late sister, “Paloma.” Like before, I told her no, and we went with our originally planned name. But now my mom is on a push about how I haven’t honored Paloma or shared memories with my kids about her, and that they’re being harmed by missing out on her as an aunt. My 6-year-old and 4-year-old know that I had a sister, but that she’s dead (classic blunt child response). But I haven’t really talked much about her. Now that my parents live closer and see the kids more often, my mom wants to change that. I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001f3b6hj6tdr3aw@published"&gt;Paloma was six years older than me. She died of complications from anorexia in her early 20s. Because of the age difference and her substantial impatient time, we weren’t that close. I honestly felt more relief than anything when she died, because her eating disorder tortured my parents almost as much as it tortured her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vt00183b6heg97eqrk@published"&gt;I know EDs and mental illness in general can be hell, but I genuinely have no good memories of her after she was about 15. She was deeply in the grip of the disorder, and it made her mean, self-destructive, judgmental, and secretive. I have distinct memories of her telling me from her hospital bed that I was fat and unlovable when I was going through puberty. And that’s probably the warmest interaction we had in my teens.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vz00193b6hls9xpux2@published"&gt;I recognize the memories I have aren’t the full version of who she was before she got sick. I loved her, but I didn’t like her. I don’t know what I could possibly pass on to my kids to share about her, besides one or two memories from when I was 7 or 8 years old. I recognize that my mom is grieving, and probably always will be. But I don’t really want to get into the details of Paloma until my kids are teenagers. Is that unfair?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wu001n3b6hgw7snl8j@published"&gt;Does your mom know how negative your relationship with your sister was? If not, it might be time to have a heartfelt but brutally honest conversation. Bring some of the specific examples that you shared here. Explain how you don’t really have any positive memories of your sister to pass on—and thus she isn’t a person that you feel you can truly honor in your family.&lt;/p&gt;

Your decision to be neutral about her is a way to be respectful—to both your sister and your mom.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wy001p3b6h8ii568cj@published"&gt;One olive branch you could consider is inviting your mom to tell the kids about Paloma. Of course, there may need to be some guardrails around these conversations. But I suspect your mom fears that Paloma is being erased or forgotten by the family.  That’s a devastating prospect for any parent. Telling her, “I can’t be the one to share Paloma with the kids, but you’re welcome to,” might give you the reprieve you need.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wd001c3b6hcdaqzckb@published"&gt;Still, even with your best intentions, your mom might not be able to hear any of this.  If that’s the case, you might consider whether family therapy could help you have this conversation more effectively. The Paloma you knew is, for all intents and purposes, not the same Paloma your mom knew and loved. She might need a neutral third party to help her come to terms with that painful truth. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

We have an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. The issue we’re facing is that my in-laws have a pool with no fence around it. Because of this, I have refused to let the kids visit their place without my husband and/or me present. My mother-in-law claims that because our kids know how to swim, a fence isn’t necessary—and that installing one would “spoil” her view of the yard. She’s been rather abrasive with me because I refuse to compromise. What can I do to impress upon her that tragedies can still happen, even to kids who know how to swim?&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, you’re the one who is responsible for your kids’ well-being, so &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get to decide what you’re comfortable with. There are so many tragedies with backyard pools that robust conversations around pool safety are a must. In the U.S., it’s the third cause of unintentional injury-related death for kids 5 to 19, which you might share with her, along with some of the harrowing stories shared by parents in this &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/child-drowning-pool-swimming-safety.html"&gt;Slate article about preventing such tragedies&lt;/a&gt;. If the science might sway her, you can point her to &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001047/full"&gt;studies that show that pool fencing&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces the risk of drowning. Or that organizations like the &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/shop-the-best-pool-safety-products-for-summer/"&gt;National Drowning Prevention Alliance strongly recommend them&lt;/a&gt; (plus they have suggestions on which to buy).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001e3b6h5q6h13ix@published"&gt;I confess that I am &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a pool owner, but I wonder if some compromise can be found. Would she be more amenable if she knew about the existence of removable fences—one that she can put up and take down at her leisure? Maybe not, since it’ll require additional work on her part. But she could presumably take the fence down if she plans to have company over, for example, or is having a weekend at home without the kids around. There are also &lt;a href="https://usglassfence.com/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-glass-pool-fencing/"&gt;glass pool fences&lt;/a&gt; that could help keep her “view” intact while still providing safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4x4001u3b6hjqh0241b@published"&gt;I wonder whether a broader conversation about all points of pool safety might uncover more common ground with your MIL than you expected. Take the opportunity to talk through other pool precautions the family should be taking beyond fencing. The experts quoted in that earlier Slate article, for example, point out that the most crucial piece of pool safety is close supervision when someone is in the water. They stressed that the person supervising “needs to be constantly attentive, close by (within arm’s reach for a novice swimmer, she says), capable of identifying drowning, and prepared to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4xa001v3b6hokjvgdvn@published"&gt;For the future, it might be worth considering where you’ll stand on the issue when your kids are a bit older. How long would the fence need to stay up for you to be comfortable? Is there an age where you don’t feel like a fence is needed? Perhaps the answer is no, and that’s OK, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wq001l3b6h0cw2xfnw@published"&gt;Realistically, she probably won’t budge, and neither should you. You say you recently just moved, so give it some time. Be kind in your insistence, and as patient as you can be when she expresses her refusal to change her yard, as is her right. Hopefully, she will (begrudgingly) get used to your rules. Demand safety, but don’t let the fence come between you if it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

The thing is, my parents are divorced and cannot stand each other—yet both want to be at the hospital, outside the delivery room, so they can see the baby immediately. I’m worried they will cause a scene (as they have at multiple family events) during what will already be a very stressful and emotionally fraught time. My husband says he doesn’t trust them to keep it together and wants to make them wait and see the baby separately in the hospital room. This will be their first grandchild. Should I give them a chance, or is my husband right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006t3b6htduj96mp@published"&gt;Let me clarify a few things. You say your parents want to be outside the delivery room so they can see the baby immediately. Have you done a hospital tour yet? I delivered in two different facilities, and in both cases, anyone not directly assisting with the birth was kept down the hall, through a secure door, in a designated waiting area—essentially “on hold” until the baby and afterbirth were delivered and mom was cleaned up. So before you make this decision, be sure you know your hospital’s procedures and set your parents’ expectations accordingly. (While you’re at it, you might also inquire whether the hospital has separate waiting rooms, where both parents could wait but stay apart.)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006u3b6hpr0ticrv@published"&gt;It’s also important to keep in mind that you have no idea how your birth is going to go. Most of the women I know experienced both intense joy and intense vulnerability in those post-first-birth hours. Some wanted to see people right away—eager to enjoy their baby with their loved ones. Others felt overwhelmed or in so much discomfort that they only wanted their spouse and child nearby. And for some, what they wanted after the baby was born was the opposite of what they’d planned beforehand. So be upfront with yourself and your loved ones that any plan you make is subject to change at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006v3b6hdslpi4yd@published"&gt;Which brings me to one of my two most important points in this reply: Your letter told me what your parents want, and what your husband wants. What do you want? Because, as the owner of the VIU (Very Important Uterus), the way this day goes is ultimately your call. It’s arguably the only time in your life when you can make demands that others must simply fulfill.  If you want your parents to meet the baby together, then brush up on your mediation skills and set some non-negotiable ground rules. If you’d rather tell everyone to take a chill pill and wait, that’s your prerogative, too. You get to decide what this looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006w3b6h8msvuppw@published"&gt;Since this is an advice column, though, I’ll give you my personal opinion. If it were me, I’d let the grandparents meet the baby first—before any other siblings or family who might also be in the waiting room—but only once I felt settled and ready. And I would have them meet the baby separately rather than together. This is a huge milestone, not only for you and your husband, but also for your parents (especially if this is their first grandchild). I wouldn’t want anyone to ruin that for you or themselves, and I would be nervous that putting them in a room together is setting them up to fail. I don’t want that for any of you. And I’d flip a coin (in advance and in full view) to decide who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006x3b6herj9fget@published"&gt;I will close with the second of my two most important points: This birth is just the beginning. Once the baby is born, your parents are going to want to be present for many more events, from birthday parties and religious rites to band concerts. If I were in your shoes, I’d start demanding that they grow up and learn how to be in the same room with each other. Your child deserves no less, and your life will be much easier if you don’t have to keep asking versions of this same question over the next 18-plus years. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the only way I knew how to put it. So many things could set her off: new carpeting, air fresheners, plastic off-gassing, diesel. Perfumes were among the worst offenders. On top of that, she developed terrible food allergies. The sound of her sniffling became the chorus of my childhood. Some days she couldn’t get out of bed. I’d peek into her darkened room and see her face pinched in discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Her joints ached, her head swam. Doctors suggested that maybe she was depressed or anxious. “Well, you’d be anxious too if you couldn’t lick an envelope, couldn’t pick up your daughter in a car,” she’d reply. She tried allergists, got nowhere. Finally, she found her way to holistic health, whose practitioners told her she had something called multiple chemical sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As long as people have complained that man-made stuff in their environment causes health problems—migraines and asthma, exhaustion and mood swings—the medical establishment has largely dismissed them. The American Medical Association, World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy &amp;amp; Immunology don’t recognize chemical sensitivity as a diagnosis. If they talk about it at all, they tend to dismiss it as psychosomatic, a malady of the neurotic and health-obsessed. Why, these authorities wondered, would people react to minute traces of a huge array of chemicals? And why couldn’t they ever seem to get better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This isn’t some trivial affliction. Roughly a quarter of American adults report some form of chemical sensitivity; it lives alongside chronic pain and fibromyalgia as both evidently real and resistant to mainstream diagnosis or treatment. My mom tried a thousand things—elimination diets, antihistamines, lymphatic massage, antidepressants, acupuncture, red light therapy, saunas, heavy-metal detoxes. Sometimes her symptoms eased, but she never got better. Her illness ruled our lives, dictating what products we bought, what food we ate, where we traveled. I felt there had to be an answer for why this was happening. It didn’t take me long to learn that, if there was one, it’d come from a figure as unassuming as she is provocative: the scientist Claudia Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;On a warm&lt;/span&gt; Texas afternoon, Miller and her affable husband, Bob, lead me through the San Antonio Botanical Garden. A monarch flits by. “I’ve noticed so many fewer butterflies, so many fewer birds, even the last couple of years,” Miller observes. Her raspy voice comes out so quietly that, at times, my recording device fails to pick it up. People are perpetually leaning in close or asking her to repeat herself. At 78, Miller typically uses a cane, but Bob gets the walker out of the car so she can cover more distance. She wears her silver hair in a low side ponytail, fixed in place with a scrunchie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;With her wide, thin-rimmed glasses, Miller disappears into the scenery, but she’s a particularly visible presence in her field. Now a professor emeritus at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Miller has held several federal appointments, chaired National Institutes of Health meetings, testified before Congress, consulted for the Environmental Protection Agency, authored dozens of papers, and worked with the Canadian, German, Japanese, and Swedish governments. In all this, she has tried to make sense of and raise awareness for chemical intolerance. One patient advocate I interviewed called her “Saint Claudia” for her commitment to overlooked and misunderstood patients. Kristina Baehr, an attorney who defends victims of toxic exposures, told me, “To have experts like Dr. Miller tell them you’re not crazy, this is very real, is very life-giving to people. She’s able to validate their experience with facts, with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One such fact, Miller explains, is this: Over the past century, the United States has undergone a chemical revolution. “Fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas, their combustion products, and then their synthetic chemical derivatives are mostly new since World War II,” she says. “Plasticizers, forever chemicals, you name it: These are all foreign chemicals.” They’re everywhere you look, in homes and offices, parks and schools. They’re also, Miller believes, making people very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 1997, Miller proposed a career-defining theory of how people succumb to this condition. It came with a technical-sounding name, toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, and a convenient acronym, TILT. You can lose tolerance after one severe exposure, Miller says, or after a series of smaller exposures over time. In either case, a switch is flipped: Suddenly, people are triggered by even tiny amounts of everyday substances—cigarette smoke, antibiotics, gas from their stoves—that never bothered them before. These people become, in a word, TILT-ed. It’s not unlike developing an allergy, when the body labels a substance as dangerous and then reacts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQTE1VOFoxS3dibkJZUEZIQ1c1ODRuSXEzb1pGbEhOZE1PVUtHQUZxMHhTR1JiYjFMTUYxY1RYejVRMTh4UldMVnhLbUlCVnVaUlY3QmlKcDlFVFp2YjJmRmRycjNqcnFRWk1haVhPOVNBd3JfeV9qaTA4VnFTeHhwVVh1UGM</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）将死-有线 | Bryan Johnson Is Going to Die - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1wVno0X1g0QkxqWkpjMlpOYzRFa2VWUU5fWnZLbl91Z0FNcDBsbDlqY2lWY2Vac1hZaWVNSEZJUEJya0dBcjBjRnA4VVNKcDV4bnAwYUtlQl9WS25pUWVZaWlHV0JGZzg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;At first, the&lt;/span&gt; two bowls of fruit on Bryan Johnson’s kitchen island look perfect. They’re brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That estate, it’s worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson’s home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you’d assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body’s aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If the rotting fruit didn’t give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson’s stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father’s anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson’s blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson’s walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Performance, of course, is Johnson’s specialty. There’s the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there’s how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times investigation&lt;/a&gt; into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Over a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of Texas measles cases tied to a West Texas outbreak slows to a trickle, South Plains public health director Zach Holbrooks remembers the call from a colleague in an adjacent county six months ago that would change both his — and the state’s — entire 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Katherine was the first person to let me know there was a case,” said Holbrooks, referring to Lubbock’s public health director, Katherine Wells. A Mennonite child from Seminole’s Gaines County — one of four counties under Holbrooks’ charge — had been hospitalized in Lubbock with measles. “So that’s what got the communication rolling between me and Katherine and the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From that first case reported on Jan. 29, the outbreak in West Texas would make up the largest single cluster of measles cases since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, killing two and spreading to multiple states. As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;762 people have been infected&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the previous U.S. record from 2019, when an outbreak among the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City resulted in 649 cases. Nationwide, the United States is suffering its worst measles outbreak in nearly three decades with the West Texas outbreak making up more than half of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,309 cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While it’s been more than a month since a new case has been reported in Gaines County, cases traced back to West Texas continue to be reported across the state in East Texas’ Lamar and Fannin counties, where this week saw the addition of nine new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Technically, Gaines and Lubbock counties are no longer considered active outbreak counties. The spread here seems to have run its course. “They either got the vaccine, the booster or the real thing,” said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff of Seminole Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the region catches its breath and wait for the entire outbreak to end, health professionals like Holbrooks, Wells and Parkey, as well as the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), have all been considering what worked and what could be improved after working the first real infectious disease test, post COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their answers included better reporting of cases at the patient level, more help with streamlining the testing process at the start and surprisingly, a more balanced treatment approach that was not solely fixated on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As of Friday, DSHS has spent more than $10.6 million in outreach, testing and resource support to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;h3 id="47064a77-1074-4298-a283-63d19731e038" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;How the West Texas outbreak posed significant challenges &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After that first fateful phone call in late January between Wells and Holbrooks, the two looked not to the 2019 New York City outbreak as a guide in how to respond, but to an outbreak that occurred five years earlier, in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;They both pored over a&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295"&gt; New England Journal of Medicine article&lt;/a&gt; that detailed how that 2014 outbreak impacted a largely unvaccinated Amish population but was mostly contained from spreading. In that case, two unvaccinated men who had traveled to the Philippines to perform relief work had returned to their community with measles. Eventually the outbreak would spread to 383 residents over nine counties before being declared over four months later. Like the West Texas outbreak, about 90% of those infected in Ohio were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I kind of wanted to just wrap my mind around how long, what kind of response are we going to be looking at?” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Surprisingly, the bulk of the spread in Texas occurred in a four month period, also.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That timespan and the fact that Ohio’s involved a branch of Anabaptists, a 16th century Christian movement that believes strongly in separation of church and state, was helpful to Holbrooks. He grew up in Seminole, home to a large population of Mennonites, also a part of the Anabaptist denomination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both Amish and Mennonite communities have no formal opposition to vaccination but many of their followers are unvaccinated, prompting Holbrooks to immediately seek out community leaders to help spread the word about the outbreak and that vaccination was the best weapon to keep measles from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the Ohio outbreak seemed a better comparison than the New York one because it occurred outside a large metro area, there were sharp differences between the 2014 cluster and that in Gaines, underscoring the unique challenges Texas health officials and beyond were up against.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Ohio, most measles cases were located in areas that reported an overall 95% vaccination, enough to ensure herd immunity. More importantly, the Ohio outbreak had occurred before the coronavirus pandemic, years before vaccination fatigue from a global pandemic set in.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By comparison, Gaines County’s vaccination rate had dropped far below the herd immunity level, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/04/west-texas-measles-outbreak-mennonite-seminole/"&gt;to 82%&lt;/a&gt; and the number of seventh graders who had filed a conscientious exemption for at least one vaccination with local schools, had grown from 2% in 2014, long before COVID-19,of seventh graders had a vaccination exemption. In 2024, it was nearly 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas outbreak also involved a more mobile population. Seminole in Gaines County is located 35 miles from New Mexico and involved a largely unvaccinated population that traveled often long distances: to Mennonite communities in Mexico and Canada as well as those located in northeastern Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their penchant for traveling made it harder for public officials to contain the spread, which eventually would lead to cases in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Oklahoma, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas, Illinois, Colorado and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5741ba72-fa6a-494f-917e-c9c134b4777a" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Undercounting of measles cases&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;To better track the spread and stop it, the state has worked with local providers and health departments to carefully document exactly how many measles infections occur. To do that, public health officials rely on local providers and hospitals to inform them when there is a case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, that number is likely an undercount because it is based on patients treated, not those who ride out the virus from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Statistically, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/measles-is-making-a-comeback-can-we-stop-it-202503063091"&gt;up to three measles cases per every 1,000 &lt;/a&gt;measles results in death. Gaines had two deaths, which would indicate the number of infections were far greater than the 441 reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Not everybody who gets sick goes to the hospital,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Among the more popular places for infected Mennonites to seek out health care was with Lubbock physician Ben Edwards, who treated hundreds of patients in a temporary clinic in Seminole. The Mennonite’s skepticism of mainstream medicine elevated Edwards — who denounced vaccines and promoted vitamin A and budesonide, something more commonly used to treat asthma, as alternative prevention and treatment options — to a medical hero for the religious community.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the local hospital in Seminole regularly reported to Holbrooks’ office every measles patient it treated, information from local providers, such as Edwards, was tougher to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was frustrating,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Reporting cases quickly to local health authorities helps them respond more quickly to keep disease from spreading, as well as to keep cases from becoming more serious where hospitalization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Emails obtained by The Texas Tribune through a public information request hint at how Holbrooks’ office had to spend extra time retrieving that information from Edwards, who like all physicians&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/investigation/Reporting-forms/notifiable-conditions-2025-bw.pdf"&gt; are to report “immediately” to local or regional health officials&lt;/a&gt; measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’ve seen multiple news reports indicating that your clinic in Seminole has treated upwards of 300 individuals for measles in Gaines County,” Holbrooks wrote Edwards in an April 14 letter, three months after the first measles case. “After reviewing our records, we have not received any corresponding case reports from your office.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually Holbrooks’ office received a list of patient names and their dates of birth but few other details. Edward apologized for the lateness, attributing it to a communication error with a community translator who was assisting him with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She and I had a miscommunication, as I had instructed her to send that list to the local health authority but she thought I had sent it,” Edwards told the Tribune. “Once I was made aware of this oversight, it was immediately corrected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5909fc21-1383-4b0c-8256-f06fb014ea06" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Lessons learned &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials’ measles messaging focused on getting the word out on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Once he reached out to community leaders, Holbrooks worked to get public health messaging aired in both English and the Mennonites’ dialect of informal or Low German.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Holbrooks had wanted to put more vaccination and field clinics closer to the Mennonites but quickly saw that doing so would attract too much attention. News of the outbreak brought a sudden influx of national reporters to tiny Seminole, forcing many locals to shy away from pop-up vaccination clinics where TV cameras and photographers were stationed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually, Seminole health workers moved to a drive-through vaccination clinic through their local show barn, a local livestock exhibition facility used by youth groups, allowing more privacy for those interested in obtaining a measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even 75 miles north in Lubbock, Wells, the city’s public health director, found that public vaccination spots, while often a hallmark of back-to-school events in August, were not as big a draw in the larger city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both she and Holbrooks recognized later that focusing on vaccination from the start could have sent a message that vaccines were the only option for treatment, possibly dissuading more susceptible residents or those with milder measles cases from asking questions or getting more help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have one more of a treatment clinic [model] and had more boots on the ground, working with churches … to engage better with the Mennonite community,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;These vaccine clinics could have been made less clinical and paired with other options, such as checking oxygen levels and passing out Pedialyte to help infected patients stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Such an approach could have invited more visitors and conversation, resulting in better triaging of residents and letting them know to seek more help from the local hospitals, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have found a way to set up something that was free, kind of caring for people with measles, not saying you’re like this infectious person,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From inside Seminole Memorial Hospital, Parkey said his facility was fending for itself as measles cases began arriving in force in February and March.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He would have liked more outreach to the private medical care sector from state and local public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We couldn’t stop seeing people. Someone could [have] come out and talk to us,” Parkey said, adding that his experience with public health during COVID was similar. “No one talked to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He wished he had more help with offering &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;faster test results to patients&lt;/a&gt;. Most hospitals either contracted with local testing labs or sent patient samples for testing in the state’s lab in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Parkey said the emphasis at the start of the outbreak on vaccines didn’t change minds, especially among his Mennonite patients and he believes it may have hardened the vaccine skepticism of many. In both measles-related deaths, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;anti-vaccine outfits&lt;/a&gt; like Children’s Health Defense stoked doubt about whether the virus was the cause of the children’s fatalities or if it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The group’s founder, current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/29/texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/"&gt;came to Seminole&lt;/a&gt; after the death of a second child and met with Mennonite families. Although Kennedy is no longer with the group, his history of &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/factcheck-org-kennedy-cites-flawed-paper-in-bid-to-justify-vaccine-autism-link/"&gt;false statements about vaccines&lt;/a&gt; together with that personal visit reinforced for many the view that the government should stay out of individual health decisions particularly related to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Anywhere you have a bunch of people who don’t believe in vaccines, you’re going to see it,” he said of downplaying measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells admits that one of the lessons from COVID is that public health officials had a &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;hard time learning to bend and pivot quickly in reaction&lt;/a&gt; to both the ever-morphing virus and the growing knowledge about who was at the greatest risk. By not communicating effectively and immediately when restrictions and advice changed, the public felt a constant whiplash of conflicting information and quickly began tuning out medical updates and vaccination alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of measles cases began to taper in April and May, so did the messaging, a sign perhaps that public health is learning to pivot more quickly to a community’s reaction to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vaccination was — and is still — touted as the best preventive measure against becoming infected by local and state public health officials. But, by &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/west-texas-measles-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;early April&lt;/a&gt;, three days after Kennedy’s Seminole visit, the state health agency posted guidance about vitamin A dosage in response to requests from infected residents for ways to ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We kind of shifted to harm reduction,” said Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We always want to give the message that’s going to do the most good to people. If that means vaccination messaging takes a back seat, then we have to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;

I was getting closer to what I would describe as a nebula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a big cloud of colors moving that were changing. Everything was vivid stars. I was just floating peacefully.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna initially dismissed her symptoms as the flu which her children had recently recovered from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna suffered a major heart attack—also known as a 'widow-maker' heart attack given its scarily low survival rate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not once did I remember or relive any bad parts of life. Everything that I thought about was the connections I had made with people or places while I was alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was just all the good stuff.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, family members had called emergency services—medics arrived just 13 minutes later and were able to resuscitate her, saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Referring to Ms Tanner as a 'miracle' case, her cardiologist said: 'In a 20-year career and over 4,000 surgeries, I've never seen anything like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't even know people could survive this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Ms Tanner arrived in hospital, cardiologists implanted a heart pump and a stent to widen the narrowed artery—a procedure which usually requires heart bypass surgery—and restore blood flow to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after just ten days in hospital—six of which she spent in intensive care—the mother-of-three walked out on her own, unaided by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet her recovery has been far from easy, seeing her gain almost three stone—which she has since lost—and suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna's X-ray shows a blockage in the LMCA, which supplies most of the heart muscle with life-giving blood and oxygen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fire department reached Jenna's home within 13 minutes, providing a life-saving service which saw Jenna walk out of hospital just 10 days after suffering a serious heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has to take thirteen different types of medication to manage her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fire department, which came to Ms Tanner's rescue as it was closest to where she lived, has since received an award for reaching her in record time and providing life-saving care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A widowmaker heart attack occurs when a blood clot completely obstructs the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the most critical artery of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, this can cut-off life-giving oxygen to the heart and the muscle can die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if a person receives immediate treatment, this sort of heart attack can cause irreversible tissue damage that can permanently affect the functioning of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now urging health authorities to update current guidelines so more people can be tested for early warning signs—potentially saving thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner’s case comes amid a worrying rise in premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes, which last year reached their highest level in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has previously reported that the number of under-40s treated by the NHS for heart attacks is also climbing, with soaring obesity rates and related health issues believed to be key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, around 420 people of working age die of as a result of heart disease each week, totalling an alarming 21,975 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is America's number one killer and nearly 1million people die of it every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said.

Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c</guid></item><item><title>青少年正试图大量摄入蛋白质补充剂。父母应该注意什么？ - NPR | Teens are trying to bulk up on protein supplements.

                &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/a&gt; last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals.

   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school, and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine," he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: "My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of body building and the gyms."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Protein supplements are big on social media, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;influencers are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day," says &lt;a href="https://chear.org/people/faculty-investigators/sarah-clark" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sarah Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist and co-director of &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good," she says. "We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy," she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78474" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietician Abriana Cain says.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much is enough? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is also such a thing as &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;protein, says Abriana Cain, a &lt;a href="https://www.childrensnational.org/get-care/departments/clinical-nutrition-services/meet-the-team" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric dietician with Children's National Hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt, and a cup of black beans.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidney and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. "They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. &lt;a href="https://nagatalab.ucsf.edu/people/jason-nagata-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act%20(DSHEA)%20amended%20the,has%20not%20been%20chemically%20altered." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so they're not tested, and their ingredients aren't verified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle building supplements and products," he says. "I would just be very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Eating disorders are up&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Separately, Nagata is concerned that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7483647/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein craze is contributing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812520?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2023.46012" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarming &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813513#:~:text=A%20study%20in%20Canada%20of,of%20improved%20screening%20and%20detection." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase in eating disorders among boys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past two decades, worldwide. He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports.

Dyslipidemia is a condition characterised by abnormal deviations in lipid levels in the blood, including elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or increased triglycerides.

The body does not react to cholesterol build-up in the arteries until there is a blockage, which can lead to heart attacks (reduced blood flow to the heart) and stroke (oxygen being cut-off to the brain).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If not treated on time, it can lead to disability and even death. In fact, as per a WHO estimate, raised cholesterol levels are behind 2.6 million deaths and 29.7 million disability-adjusted life years globally each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/12/17/550x309/h_1671275024049_1671275057480_1671275057480.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Cholesterol are fat-like substances that help in the making of hormones.

However, high amounts of cholesterol can cause cardiovascular diseases.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of symptoms in conditions like dyslipidemia leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, missing the critical window for preventive intervention and lifestyle correction. Most patients do not seek medical help until it is too late, mainly because the symptoms which have been enlisted below are too common place and ranges from:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling out of breath during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart Palpitations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about the condition in an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Nihar Mehta, interventional cardiologist at Jaslok Hospital in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mumbai, shared, “Dyslipidemia is a highly treatable condition and can be managed with proper medication and lifestyle changes. Total cholesterol test looks for levels of LDL (bad cholesterol), HDL (good cholesterol), and Triglycerides. For high-risk population, those with familial hypercholesterolemia, obesity and diabetes, an inherited disease that causes high LDL levels, routine lipid profiling, especially in high-risk or sedentary individuals, is essential to detect dyslipidemia early and initiate timely management to avoid long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The optimal lipid level varies depending on the individual’s age, sex and other risk factors but generally, the following ranges are recommended:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; more than 40 mg/dL for men and more than 50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triglycerides:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 150 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 200 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to beat this deadly cholesterol disorder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting healthier habits can significantly improve lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular risks. Dr Mehta suggested, “Lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage but not necessarily cure dyslipidemia. Regular medication adherence is essential for better outcomes. If lipid is higher than optimal, avoid foods high in cholesterol, saturated fats, trans fats, added sugars and salt. Make sure to exercise for at least 150 minutes every week. Maintaining a healthy weight and body mass index, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake are all recommended.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/07/04/Pictures/_84664e3e-41a0-11e6-8e05-c384b245cd95.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="NAFLD can also lead to insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease can affect lipid levels or increase the risk of cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is important to remain compliant with all medications and be consistent with follow-ups with your healthcare provider. A proactive approach is essential for preventing complications and protecting long-term heart health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer compounds, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team used a specific bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T, to ferment stevia leaves. They compared the fermented version (which they call FSLE) to regular stevia extract and found that FSLE performed better in every way they tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Masanori Sugiyama explained, “To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They optimized the fermentation process and found that stevia was most effective when fermented for 72 hours, at 37°C, without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: fermented stevia effectively killed pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) while barely affecting healthy cells, even at higher doses. This selectivity is crucial for safe cancer treatments. Instead of an immediate kill, FSLE sometimes slowed down cancer cell growth, making them look weak and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia also showed strong antioxidant properties, which is essential since oxidative stress is a big factor in cancer development. It neutralized free radicals more effectively than the non-fermented version, achieving a 94% scavenging power in one test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the takeaway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that fermentation transforms compounds into more active versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a compound called chlorogenic acid is converted into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME) during fermentation. CAME was found to be more effective than regular chlorogenic acid in halting cancer cell growth and triggering cancer cell self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its potency was significant: the dose needed to kill half the cancer cells was much lower for CAME compared to regular chlorogenic acid. CAME works by blocking the cell cycle and forcing cells into apoptosis, their self-destruct mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a genetic level, CAME influenced genes associated with cell death, activating pro-apoptotic genes while shutting down those that prevent cell death. This supports the observed effects, showing that CAME doesn’t just kill cells randomly; it drives them into a specific self-destruction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up in simpler terms, this research suggests that fermented stevia could be a promising new avenue for effective cancer treatment, particularly for hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is stevia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is a sweet sugar substitute that is about 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It is extracted from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant (shrub) native to tropical and subtropical America, and areas of Paraguay and Brazil. The active compounds in stevia are steviol glycosides, and the leaves may be used as a calorie-free substitute for sugar. Stevia is heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than just a sweetener:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is not just a substitute for sugar anymore; it’s stepping up its game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to fermentation, researchers have discovered that stevia extract can be transformed into a compound that fights cancer while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This exciting change is linked to specific enzymes from a bacterial strain called SN13T. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Danshiitsoodol, “This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that this new compound, CAME, is more effective at harming cancer cells and promoting cell death in PANC-1 cells than chlorogenic acid alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The way ahead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for this research? The team has plans to take their work from the lab to the real world, with mouse studies coming up. This will test if fermented stevia can work within living systems, which have complex immune responses and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Danshiitsoodol, “The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going by this research, with the right microbes, even a simple leaf like stevia could become a powerful weapon against cancer.

step you take during the day will be a fast-paced, outdoor stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are these slower steps still valuable to our health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Dr Milica McDowell, a doctor of

Walking for exercise falls into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pJzCsoW2u6F95s4aGbq6zi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pJzCsoW2u6F95s4aGbq6zi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are cardiovascular and muscular conditioning benefits to intentional walking: your heart rate increases, your stress levels decrease and your mood lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you and I were to go out for a 10-minute intentional walk, we’re getting into a rhythm,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re breathing rhythmically, our arms are swinging and the pelvis is rotating a little bit. Your nervous system is getting into a rhythm with all that movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentional walks don’t have to be particularly long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A five-minute walk is called a micro walk,” says McDowell. “If you can add even five more minutes of walking a day, you will still see a difference in your longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute intentional walk could help you get an extra 500 steps, which can have a big impact on your health, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;showed that increasing daily steps by 500 (from a 2,500 baseline) reduced the chances of death from cardiovascular causes by 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell also suggests partnering up for your intentional walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inviting someone along on a walk will generally make the walk longer, therefore more effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnered walks also have a positive impact on mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it’s great to have a certain step count and it’s great to do it in the right shoes, by walking with someone we can also take care of filling up our social cup and making sure that we’re engaging with our community, which can have positive impacts on mental health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ambient-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ambient walking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell explains that ambient walking is the kind of walking you do when wandering around your apartment or letting your pet out to toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ambient walking is typically broken up, which is why we categorize a longer duration walk as intentional because you are priming your entire system and getting into a steady state” says McDowell, “versus ‘I’ve got up to go and get coffee,’ or ‘I picked up my newspaper,’ or ‘I took the dog for a spin around the block’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those ambient walking steps still count, but they provide a different type of benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t get the cardiovascular and muscular conditioning boost that you would from an intentional walk, but ambient walking still contributes to calorie burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as you’re walking, we’re happy,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambient walking steps also reflect time that you aren’t spending sitting still, which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for long periods is associated with a slower metabolic rate, which leads to issues with blood sugar, blood pressure and fat breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sitting is the new smoking,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting up and wandering around your office space or getting a cup of coffee can break up longer periods of sitting and mitigate some of the negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware that to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase your step count safely&lt;/a&gt;, you need to increase it slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are walking 2,500 steps a day, you should only increase by a maximum of 250 steps a week to avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surgeons at Duke University have resuscitated a 'dead' heart on the operating table after it stopped beating for more than five minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organ was later transplanted into the chest of a three-month-old child, saving their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant with the donor heart continued to show normal cardiac function and no signs of organ rejection at six months of age, according to a brief report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-personality-changes-sometimes-happen-after-organ-transplants?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Eerie Personality Changes Sometimes Happen After Organ Transplants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story is proof that the concept of 'on-table reanimation' works at preserving hearts for transplantation – at least for infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the consent of the donor family, surgeons reinvigorated a small donor heart on the operating table using an oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, and a hanging reservoir to collect expelled blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contraption had to be custom-designed, as current care systems that keep organs alive outside of bodies are too big for infant hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in the United States, up to 20 percent of infants in need will die waiting for a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most organ donors must be declared brain dead before donation. Only 0.5 percent of pediatric heart transplants are donated after circulatory death, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when the heart stops beating and blood stops circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some critics do not think it is morally correct to take &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/100950"&gt;a terminal patient off life support&lt;/a&gt;, get their heart beating again, and then remove it for transplantation. Concerns arise over declarations of death, and how to reanimate organs in an ethical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After circulatory death, donor hearts can be re-oxygenated while they are still in the donor body, or they can be resuscitated on the operating table using machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png" alt="Organ Donation" class="size-medium wp-image-168331" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-683x415.png 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-768x467.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-600x365.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Organ donation sources and techniques.

They also note that using organs after circulatory death has the potential to increase the donor pool by up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another team of surgeons at Vanderbilt University has a different idea. They have devised a way to avoid the most common ethical concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their technique doesn't seek to immediately reanimate donor hearts; instead, it preserves them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent brief report, the team explains that with&lt;span&gt; an aorta clamp and a cold-preserving flush of liquid, they successfully recovered three donor hearts for transplantation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By clamping off the heart's circulatory system, the team kept their work separate from the donor's brain (which raises ethical concerns over resuscitation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our technique flushes oxygenated preservation solution to the donor heart only, without reanimation of the heart and without systemic or brain perfusion," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In initial surgeries, the technique showed "excellent early postoperative outcomes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three donor hearts were successfully transplanted with healthy function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This method of heart recovery offers the possibility of broad application," the Vanderbilt surgeons &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503487"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; reports were both published in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It might actually protect your heart! This humble cup of tea might just be the heart’s best-kept secret. Yes, that’s right. Beyond its comforting warmth and rich aroma, black tea may have many health benefits that keep you healthy later in life. Scientists now believe that this popular beverage may hold the power to reduce the risk of life-threatening conditions like heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Edith Cowan University (ECU) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.318408" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, black tea is good for cardiovascular health. But how does a simple brew wield such strength? Let’s take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Put the kettle on!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Black tea has many heart-protective properties, thanks to its flavonoids. Flavonoids are naturally occurring substances found in many common foods and beverages, such as black tea. The protective effects of black tea are long known; however, the ECU research found that they may be even better for us than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the health benefits of black tea, the researchers observed 881 elderly women (median age of 80), who consumed black tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that these participants were far less likely to have an extensive build-up of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) as they consumed a high level of flavonoids in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAC is the calcification of the abdominal aorta, the largest artery in the body, which supplies oxygenated blood from the heart to the abdominal organs and lower limbs, and is a predictor of cardiovascular risk, such as heart attack and stroke. It is also a reliable predictor for late-life dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Not a fan of tea? Don’t worry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A daily cup of tea could help you to enjoy better health late in life, however, what if you’re not a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/warning-drinking-too-much-tea-can-cause-heart-palpitations-anxiety-and-other-health-risks/articleshow/122422561.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; drinker? Well don’t worry, there are other things you can add to your diet. The researchers found that you can still reap the benefits by adding certain foods and beverages, which are rich in flavonoids. “In most populations, a small group of foods and beverages, uniquely high in flavonoids, contribute the bulk of total dietary flavonoid intake. The main contributors are usually black or green tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, red wine, apples, raisins, or grapes, and dark chocolate,” Ben Parmenter, who led the study, and is a researcher at the ECU Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The mighty flavonoids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids are a diverse group of phytonutrients (plant-based compounds), known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of flavonoids, such as flavan-3-ols and flavonols, which the study indicated appear to also have a link with AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants who took high amounts of total flavonoids, flavan-3-ols and flavonols were 36% to 39% less likely to have extensive AAC. Black tea was the main source of total flavonoids in this study and it was associated with significantly lower odds of extensive AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who had two to six cups of tea per day had 16% to 42% less chance of having extensive AAC, compared to people who are non-tea drinkers. However, a few other dietary sources of flavonoids such as fruit juice, red wine, and chocolate, did not show a significant beneficial association with AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Not just tea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though black tea was the main source of flavonoids in the study, the researchers said people could still benefit from flavonoids without putting the kettle on. “Out of the women who don’t drink black tea, higher total non-tea flavonoid intake also appears to protect against extensive calcification of the arteries. This implies flavonoids from sources other than black tea may be protective against AAC when tea is not consumed,” Mr Parmenter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Supreme Court Pushes Central Govt to Finalise FOPL: What It Means &amp;amp; Why It Matters? | Explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that looking at other sources of this was important as it allows non-tea drinkers to still benefit from flavonoids in their diet. “In other populations or groups of people, such as young men or people from other countries, black tea might not be the main source of flavonoids. AAC is a major predictor of vascular disease events, and this study shows intake of flavonoids, that could protect against AAC, is easily achievable in most people’s diets,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxQSXU4V2c1cl9OZ2hPSEtKWTgzMk9zSGVQYmlxejU4clp6RzBCbE1aT0NaOGlCd29Td3RsZUMzQjQ2R181ZF9uSVNuUFphMlQ1OUd4RGlUOVhBbW9YSjNQdUdCV0FSbjR5UmUxeGxKbGRlT1F5dFZKNlVONlhobUlGV0dfSGFxR09QYWNPTlB4aDBzTVhMOWljT3BtQ1gtRDVSQWdOQ1ZUNHlEODZVMWh5ZHFfT0ctQ1J6OXJ5NHFYYUVTWnVVcXdCeC1hTHVYajBmNDcwSksyWVhYamhPVjhqRzFLNnQ2OWVwcU1rTm1SUnpHT29mUWExeHY3NTlUdw</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：美国胃肠病学家分享6种可以降低结肠癌风险的零食想法-印度时报 | Colon Cancer: US Gastroenterologist shares 6 snack ideas that can reduce colon cancer risk - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is increasingly common, especially among younger adults.

One clinical trial (published earlier this year in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/18/4/235/754306/Systemic-Inflammation-and-the-Inflammatory-Context" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) showed 28 g of walnuts daily reduced inflammation markers and vimentin levels, proteins tied to aggressive colon tumors.

The combination of antioxidants, fiber, and hydration supports digestion and reduces carcinogen exposure in the colon. Moreover, you can enjoy them fresh, in smoothies, or sprinkled in salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made of over 90% water, watermelon aids hydration and regular digestion. This luscious fruit is not only crucial for colon health, but the lycopene and antioxidants in watermelon contribute anti-inflammatory benefits, slashing the risk of colorectal cancer considerably. What’s more?

    &lt;p&gt;Semen, sperm, spunk, cum, ejaculate, pre-cum, seminal fluid. These are just some of the many words we use to describe what comes out of an erect penis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these terms can be used interchangeably, but they’re not all the same. Do you know the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is sperm?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"&gt;male reproductive (sex) cells&lt;/a&gt;. The word “sperm” can refer to spermatozoon (singular) or spermatozoa (plural).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are tiny cells with an oval-shaped body and a long tail. They measure just &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/andr.12500"&gt;1/20th&lt;/a&gt; of a millimetre in length and can only be seen with a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are produced in the two &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23964-testicles"&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt; (testicles). The testes are glands located inside the scrotum (the skin sac underneath where the penis is attached to the body).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The testes begin producing sperm at puberty. Sperm production then continues &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"&gt;throughout adult life&lt;/a&gt;, beginning to decline around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4818633/"&gt;age 40&lt;/a&gt;. The testes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10095/"&gt;make about&lt;/a&gt; 200 million sperm every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop, sperm &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10889116/"&gt;need a temperature range&lt;/a&gt; of 34–35°C, which is lower than core body temperature (usually &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/fever"&gt;between 36 and 37°C&lt;/a&gt;). This is why the testes are located in the cooler scrotum and not in the abdomen or pelvis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each sperm carries &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Chromosome"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, which are made up of DNA and genes. When a sperm cell fertilises a female reproductive cell (an ovum or egg), the genetic information of the sperm and ovum combines to form an embryo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is semen?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculated sperm has to reach the uterine (&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/inaccurate-and-misogynistic-why-we-need-to-make-the-term-hysterectomy-history-257972"&gt;fallopian&lt;/a&gt;) tubes to fertilise an egg. This is a long journey, so sperm are carried in a fluid that nourishes and protects it (seminal fluid). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen is the mix of sperm and seminal fluid together. It is Latin for “seed” &lt;a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/semen"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;serere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “to sow”. Semen only exists outside the body, because sperm and seminal fluid only combine at the point of ejaculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seminal fluid is &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;made in&lt;/a&gt; the sex glands. These are the seminal vesicles and prostate, which sit just behind and below the bladder, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Semen is about 10% sperm.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/male-reproductive-system-median-section-127210979"&gt;Alila Medical Media/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;seminal vesicles&lt;/a&gt; produce a thick, gel-like substance. It clumps the sperm together immediately after ejaculation and provides the sperm with energy (fructose) to survive their journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fluid is alkaline – the opposite to acidic – which protects sperm in the &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/vaginal-ph-balance"&gt;more acidic&lt;/a&gt; vagina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prostate secretes a &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;thinner, milky fluid&lt;/a&gt; with acids that &lt;a href="https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001105"&gt;liquefy&lt;/a&gt; the semen. This helps the sperm to separate from the initial clump so they can travel through the cervix and uterus to the uterine tubes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prostate also provides &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589359/"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, which is essential for sperm survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculating &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538429/"&gt;secretes these fluids and sperm&lt;/a&gt; into the urethra, the narrow tube that runs through the penis and also transports urine. At this point, they combine as semen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;is about&lt;/a&gt; 10% sperm and 90% fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What happens after ejaculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;Ejaculating&lt;/a&gt; usually produces between 1.5 and 5 millilitres of semen, and each mL contains anywhere between &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/normal-sperm-count#:%7E:text=A%20typical%20sperm%20count%20ranges%20from%2015%20million,sperm%20count%20is%20often%20referred%20to%20as%20oligospermia."&gt;15 and 200 million sperm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If semen is ejaculated into a vagina, sperm have to travel &lt;a href="https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/clinical-anatomy-of-the-uterus-fallopian-tubes-and-ovaries/item/1"&gt;around 15 centimetres&lt;/a&gt; to reach the uterine tubes, which is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23184-fallopian-tubes"&gt;most common site&lt;/a&gt; for fertilisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest and healthiest sperm travel this distance – about 3,000 times their body length – in &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/ss/slideshow-conception"&gt;only 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a human of average height, this equates to swimming about 5 kilometres in half an hour. That means sperm can swim twice as fast as the current &lt;a href="https://www.worldaquatics.com/news/2657419/wellbrock-and-cunha-claim-open-water-5km-fina-world-championship-titles"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; for a 5km open water swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does ‘pre-cum’ have sperm in it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aroused and erect penis can secrete up to 4mL of pre-ejaculate (pre-cum), which is completely different to semen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-ejaculate is produced by different sex glands – the small &lt;a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bulbourethral-glands"&gt;bulbourethral glands&lt;/a&gt; that sit just under the prostate. It is a mucus fluid that lubricates and flushes out the urethra in the penis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, pre-ejaculate doesn’t contain sperm. However, one small &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3564677/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found the pre-ejaculate of about 40% of men they studied contained sperm, though in very low numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of getting pregnant from pre-ejaculate is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782424002506"&gt;very low – but not zero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can semen say about your overall health?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen is usually creamy-white or pale grey. It often has a faint ammonia or bleach smell, because of its &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326242#:%7E:text=Normal%20semen%20is%20slightly%20alkaline,or%20ammonia%2C%20which%20is%20normal."&gt;alkaline pH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However its colour, consistency and smell &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/facts-about-semen-an-indication-of-health-status-2328524"&gt;can vary between people&lt;/a&gt; and even on different days for the same person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If semen has a foul odour, it &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326242#semen-health-tips"&gt;may indicate an infection&lt;/a&gt; and should be checked by a doctor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Contraception and fertility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/vasectomy"&gt;vasectomy&lt;/a&gt; is a form of male contraceptive.  This involves cutting &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22763-vas-deferens"&gt;the two vas deferens&lt;/a&gt; – the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the urethra. After a vasectomy, ejaculating will produce slightly less semen and it won’t contain sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(24)00523-7/fulltext"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have also started for a new potential &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-enters-clinical-trials-for-the-first-time"&gt;male contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt; that blocks sperm production in the testes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4429439/#:%7E:text=Oxidative%20stress%20resulting%20from%20excessive,to%20standard%20male%20fertility%20investigation."&gt;Oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress"&gt;an imbalance&lt;/a&gt; of too many damaging chemicals and not enough antioxidants – has a negative impact on sperm health and strongly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7222198/"&gt;contributes to male infertility&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has published a range of values for semen volume and sperm number, concentration, movement and structure among fertile males. However, low sperm count does not always mean lower fertility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20905998.2024.2421626#abstract"&gt;keep sperm healthy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s recommended to eat a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and not smoke, use recreational drugs or drink a lot of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Too many streaming services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/little-things-deeply-unhappy-people-have-in-their-homes-streaming-services.png" alt="unhappy man with too many streaming services watching TV" title="too many streaming services little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Prostock-studio | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many streaming services or screens are some of the little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy — not just because they negatively affect mood, productivity, and mental health, but because they're expensive and draining in the face of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/2025.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;a Deloitte report&lt;/a&gt;, the average person spends nearly $70 a month on streaming services alone, even though they often don't use all of them on a regular basis. Not only can this add up substantially, especially for people in an already uncertain financial situation, but indulging these subscriptions and services on a daily basis out of guilt for spending on them can negatively impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does mindless entertainment and passive activities like watching TV &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939997/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tend to damper our mood and well-being&lt;/a&gt;, trying to cope with insecurity, discomfort, or emotional turmoil with distractions like turning on the TV &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/1/zmad056/7582213" rel="nofollow"&gt;or doomscrolling on our phones&lt;/a&gt; can be incredibly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-brilliant-people-do-whenever-tempted-doomscroll"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Things Brilliant People Do Whenever They're Tempted To Doomscroll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

They may feed into trend cycles and adopt toxic consumerist habits to feel like they belong — like buying clothes from social media — even if it adds more financial strain and isolation to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-with-great-emotional-intelligence-usually-have-these-things-in-their-home"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People With Great Emotional Intelligence Usually Have These 11 Things In Their Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Not only do they lack the nutrition their bodies and minds need to thrive, they tend to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/news/how-much-fast-food-prices-have-changed-end-2019"&gt;financially strain people amid rising costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition and a healthy diet is more important for mental health, brain cognition, and general well-being than many people realize.

Not only is it a constant reminder of a habit you're struggling to keep up with, sparking shame and guilt in your everyday life, it's expensive and financially draining, especially for people already struggling with money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it may be one of the last things an unhappy person wants to indulge, it can be the difference-maker for breaking bad habits and disrupting the cycle of depression they've fallen victim to. Like &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847" rel="nofollow"&gt;a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; suggests, even the most basic habits — like walking or stretching before bed — can be realistic treatments for people struggling with their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/tiny-social-cues-reveal-someone-just-pretending-like-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Tiny Social Cues That Reveal Someone Is Just Pretending To Like You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also "frustrated and annoyed" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She called on people to heed public health guidelines and "protect the ones that can't protect themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025," Ms Birch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZw</guid></item><item><title>与癌症疾病相关的刷牙.. -大安得拉邦 | Brushing Teeth Linked To Cancer Disease.. - Great Andhra</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNOTJ2LVVhT253Y0xTSkxKU2tUaHlBajB1RW1Id1poN1Nrb3hVR2RlUGV2Rm9ydTk0MmxqYnZXMFZ3R1hKQ0Y3elFVaWxXQzNyRXJQbWEtc01OM011aHo1MkJnMkdDTFB5allRMHUxOHRtLU9FY3F4TjQ5NHRWUXJEMWI2b1B5RS1ralBNX2NFcmdhVkZzSlVucnpSVDlrdTlYcUHSAZABQVVfeXFMTXhzSjNhdkYtak03WU9GZzNtY0VfY3gyYXdtdDhCQ0J2UG11Ukc4REFpQnV3WU5wNUhqRFBpUjJWT1NvUlp5bXRrLVBPVl9vcm5IMDV4RHlORE5jaEI1ZGpuYXlIZnQwd2p0aDJXaVJHWlRCT1ZoWTB6X2JleGxoMTJSbzZfYVptT29VQ1VqU0N6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="unselectable"&gt;

					
						
												&lt;p&gt;A recent AIIMS Delhi study highlights the critical role of oral health in preventing and managing serious illnesses, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasized that oral hygiene practices must be integrated into all levels of healthcare, not just at the primary level, to improve overall health outcomes and reduce disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence links poor oral hygiene with conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and especially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gum disease, in particular, shows strong association with cancers of the head, neck, lungs, breast and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from international studies revealed that routine dental care, like brushing daily and visiting the dentist annually; can reduce the risk of head and neck cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment, especially radiotherapy, significantly affects oral health. Patients with poor gum health face higher complications after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, maintaining oral hygiene before, during and after therapy is essential for better recovery and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study calls for better data from South Asia, awareness campaigns, school-based brushing programs and policies restricting sugar and tobacco promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recommend that WHO South-East Asia Region implement affordable, evidence, based oral health programs to reduce cancer risks and health inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public awareness, supervised brushing and policy changes could help transform oral healthcare in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Had we not met Dr Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben Trotman, 43, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022, is now showing no signs of the disease after being administered an immunotherapy drug in a world first two years ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most patients with the aggressive form of brain cancer typically die within 12-to-18 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Trotman went on to have the current standard treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He also undergoes quarterly cans, which continue to return clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We obviously don't know what the future holds but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trial, from University College London Hospital's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, follows a previous one on the same drug which closed because of lack of recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dame Siobhain McDonagh MP lead a fundraising campaign to raise more than £1million to cover the costs of the new trials after her sister, Baroness McDonagh, died from glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dame Siobhain said: 'My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Changing this was Margaret's final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret's Trial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland said: 'When I met Margaret she said to me 'what can I do to support you to cure this disease?'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland with Dame Siobhan McDonagh.

The tend to come on really, really quickly, within a matter of seconds. You don't usually have a warning and they will knock you down to the floor until they're over.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller, who lives in Montana, spent much of his adult life suffering attacks up to four times a day for months at a time until they suddenly disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His clusters have slowed in recent years, but like the 1 in 1,000 Americans with the disorder, Zeller waits for the next attack with limited tools at his disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his newly released book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction – and a Search for Relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Zeller detailed his decades–long search for cluster headache relief, along with the wackiest things he's tried to quell the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Journalist Tom Zeller Jr's new book explores treatments and causes of cluster headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never wanted to write this book, to be honest. I did not want people to know I had headaches. It's just terrible to be seen in this way,' Zeller told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I also felt like if you're going to write a book, they say, "Write about what you know." I realized that I know headaches.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cluster headaches are extremely painful and strike quickly in frequent attacks, or 'clusters,' lasting weeks or months at a time, earning the grim nickname 'suicide headaches.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder usually causes sharp and stabbing pain in or around the eye, restlessness, tears and eye redness, forehead sweating, swelling around the eye and eyelid drooping. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14579791/migraines-surprising-cure-effects-doctor-free.html"&gt;close relative of migraines&lt;/a&gt;, they're far less common. About 0.1 percent of Americans have had a cluster headache attack at some point in their lives, while 15 percent – most of whom are women – have migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Zeller, the attacks drove a wedge in his journalism career, often forcing him to 'retreat from opportunities in the newsroom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not easy. The book talks about how any sort of headache disorder is kind of a drag on the momentum of your life. They're always slowing you down,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I wasn't having the headaches, I felt like I was pretty bold and pretty accomplished as a journalist. But when the headaches would come on, I would sort of disappear and I would work from home a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cluster headaches affect one in 1,000 Americans and cause debilitating pain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a lot of stigma attached to headaches in a weird way. I tried very hard to make sure that no one knew that I had these headaches. You start to hide and that meant hiding from opportunities at work too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the book, Zeller detailed a laundry list of unorthodox treatments he tried or researched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was being ground down by the relentless injections, self–administered into an abdomen bruised and pockmarked by previous jabs, and overuse of the medication was likely driving an endless cycle of rebound attacks,' he wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given this unappealing tableau, why not shrooms?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, has been shown to alter how the brain processes and perceives pain signals and is thought to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also tried inhaling capsaicin, an extract in chili peppers that gives them their signature heat. Some research suggests it helps desensitize nerve fibers in the nasal passages that transmit cluster headache pain to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller also rented oxygen tanks from a welding supplier as a 'really fast way to abort a cluster headache attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also remember a forum saying that if you just tried to chug like 60 glasses of water a day, or some absurd amount, it would cure your headaches. I was willing to try, but all I did was visit the toilet a lot with headaches,' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller said many patients with cluster headaches have to rely on bizarre hacks because of the lack of medications geared specifically toward their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is the cover of Tom Zeller Jr's book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing that surprised me most, and what probably prompted the book, was that so little research was out there on primary headache disorders,' Zeller explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are often prescribed beta blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants and other drugs manufactured for other illnesses, as they can treat headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the advent of CGRP drugs has changed the picture. Approved by the FDA in 2018, these preventative drugs block or reduce the effects of CGRP, which causes migraine and cluster headache pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of times you'll find a drug or remedy that does kind of work, but the body adapts. We're very plastic, and over time, those things start to wane,' Zeller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller uses the CGRP medication Emgality, the only FDA approved medication specifically designed for cluster headaches and migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cluster headache dose of Emgality is significantly higher than the migraine dose – 300 milligrams compared to 120 milligrams – and both versions are given through a subcutaneous injection just under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cluster headaches are their own unique animal, so once the headaches start happening, it does seem to be pretty hard to stop,' Zeller revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I think three times in I'm sort of convinced that the CGRP blockers work for me to stop a bout from happening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The book opens with him tripping on magic mushrooms for cluster headaches (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like migraines, cluster headaches often become less frequent and severe with age, which some research suggests could be due to hormonal fluctuations and altered blood vessel function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller's clusters in recent years have slowed and can now fall years apart, but he's far from being in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think I, or anyone really, is out of the woods yet,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Zeller said he hopes his new book will help improve cluster headache awareness and provide a sense of community for readers with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his research, he spoke with several cluster headache and migraine patients who at first were 'guarded' and wary of speaking about their experience over fears of it being trivialized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But throughout the interviews, they became excited because they had 'this pent–up desire to just unload about it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope they feel seen by the book,' Zeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Someone out there is paying attention and you can take heart in that, and if you're able to buy time between painful bouts, I hope that you know the book will be affirming in that you know you're not alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds provide fiber, omega-3s and antioxidants that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are versatile, cost-effective and easy to incorporate into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating plant-based foods, exercising and not smoking are also important for better cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, lifestyle changes are key. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292224/high-cholesterol-diet-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, or hypercholesterolemia, occurs when excess cholesterol is present in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vandanasheth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt; says, “High cholesterol is linked to diet, genetics and lifestyle. Over time, this can increase your risk for heart disease.” The good news is that even just a few simple tweaks to your diet can make a big difference in managing your cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, adding a sprinkle of chia seeds to your meals is an easy way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boost your intake of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats—key nutrients for lowering cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, one review showed that consuming 35 grams (about 2.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds per day led to noticeable reductions  in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here, registered dietitians explain why chia seeds are the #1 food to eat more of if you have high cholesterol, along with other strategies for managing your levels. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are the edible seeds of the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica&lt;/em&gt; plant and are an impressive source of dietary fiber, plant-based protein, antioxidants, omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and easy to incorporate into meals and snacks. Here are some of the reasons why adding chia seeds to your diet may be beneficial if you have high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide an Ample Amount of Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are rich in fiber, with a 2-tablespoon serving providing 10 grams of fiber, including 1.5 grams of soluble fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to help lower cholesterol by binding to cholesterol in the small intestine and removing it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When chia seed is mixed with water, the soluble fiber forms a gel called &lt;em&gt;mucilage,&lt;/em&gt; which can help transport cholesterol out of the body through the digestive tract,” says &lt;a href="http://kristydelcoro.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that consuming at least 5–10 grams of soluble fiber per day may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5.5–11 mg per deciliter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another impressive benefit of chia seeds is their rich concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Chia seeds are rich in plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, which positively support heart health,” says Sheth. Research suggests that ALA can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also help increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, though the findings weren’t significant.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are simple to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate into a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and are relatively inexpensive—especially if you buy them in bulk. Akerman notes that while the price varies by brand, chia seeds are generally cost-effective as you’ll likely only use a tablespoon or two at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds can be added to virtually any dish, from creamy overnight oats to dinner-sized salads. “Add chia seeds to a smoothie, mix into a yogurt, soak overnight in soy milk (also good for lowering cholesterol) to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;make a chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; or use [them] in granola. Powder form can be used in baked goods, bread or cracker doughs, oatmeal or smoothies,” says Del Coro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight chia seed pudding is Sheth’s favorite recipe for a delicious, heart-healthy breakfast or snack. She varies up the milk (almond, soy) and adds fresh fruit (berries, mango, stone fruit) and a small handful of chopped nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds). You can also sprinkle chia seeds over a slice of avocado toast, add them to a classic PB&amp;amp;J or use them to make a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-protein-powder-11713647" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure to add chia seeds gradually into your diet and drink plenty of water to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like bloating or gas. Sheth notes that this is particularly important if you’re not used to eating a high-fiber diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unopened, chia seeds can last up to 5 years when stored in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cabinet. Once opened, Akerman recommends storing chia seeds in an airtight container in the fridge to extend their shelf life and prevent them from going rancid. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain risk factors for high cholesterol, like your genetics, age and family history, are outside of your control. However, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help lower your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health. Here are three strategies to try:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat more plants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sheth recommends filling your plate with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7943524/plant-based-low-cholesterol-dinner-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; and heart-healthy fats, like olive oil, to help lower cholesterol. Whole, minimally processed plant-based foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes, are packed with beneficial nutrients for heart health and cholesterol levels. In addition to providing fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals, they’re also typically low in saturated fat. Compared to omnivorous diets, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegan and vegetarian diets&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with lower total and LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Move your body  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Akerman highlights the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;importance of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Regular exercise is shown to increase HDL and lower LDL levels. To help prevent or reduce high cholesterol, the American Heart Association recommends engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense cardiovascular exercise per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swimming, cycling, running and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; are all classic examples of aerobic exercise. Dancing, hiking, vigorous yard work and gardening also count. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Do not smoke  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoking and vaping can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Smoking can also increase the risk of heart disease by increasing triglyceride levels and other health conditions associated with high cholesterol, like diabetes and high blood pressure. If you currently smoke, reach out to a healthcare professional for guidance and resources on how to quit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain soluble fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, all of which can help improve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support overall heart health. Besides being incredibly nutritious, these tiny but mighty seeds are also easy to use, versatile and relatively inexpensive, making them an excellent addition to your pantry (or fridge). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no one food&lt;/a&gt; can magically improve your cholesterol levels. Eating an overall healthy diet that’s rich in minimally processed plant-based foods, moving your body daily and not smoking are also key. Cholesterol-lowering medications may also be necessary for some folks. Regardless of where you start, identify at least one or two changes you can make today to start moving towards a more heart-healthy lifestyle.

Controlling blood sugar levels can help benefit the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes and obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes and obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/experts-reveal-5-step-approach-healthier-gut-stronger-immunity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research published in the journal Nutrients found that patients who followed the meal sequencing method — eating vegetables before refined carbohydrates — showed a significant improvement in glycemic control and blood sugar after a five-year period, while the group that did not follow the approach did not show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What causes the sugar spikes is eating too many carbs," Sandra J. Arevalo, a New York-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating them alone makes it even worse," she cautioned. "When eating them together with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, we are cushioning their effect by slowing their absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that eating protein before refined carbs promotes the secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the gut, which delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat other foods first — mainly fiber-rich foods — and then you &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink water&lt;/a&gt;, the fiber from the foods helps you feel satisfied, thus decreasing your appetite," Arevalo told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And let’s not forget that fiber also helps to reduce the absorption of sugar in the blood, helping to cushion your sugar levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex carbohydrates — such as most vegetables, beans and legumes — are rich in fiber and slow to digest, which causes a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates — such as sugar, white rice and white flour — have higher glycemic levels, which are easier to break down and contribute to faster blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrition experts pointed out, eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;during digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower during digestion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assist with healthier food choices and to monitor blood sugar levels after a meal, experts recommend using a food rating system called the glycemic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rating scale determines how quickly certain foods can cause blood sugars to rise and fall, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, Susie laid out the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with eating non-starchy vegetables first, as the fiber slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat protein and healthy fats.

			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression.

Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods. (Ekaterina Kapranova/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think something in the way that omega-3 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327816302198"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and keeps vital brain processes &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3820"&gt;ticking over&lt;/a&gt; might be helping regulate aggression. There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but the team suggests there's enough evidence to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154"&gt;the studies that show&lt;/a&gt; that medications derived from fish oil can help reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks, strokes, and other heart health problems, and there seems to be plenty of upside to adding some omega-3 to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 is not a magic bullet that is going to completely solve the problem of violence in society," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But can it help?

There has been a consistent yearly growth rate of 10.7% in this sector, showed the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts offer a slew of reasons for this rise, ranging from better awareness of heart diseases, new parameters for measuring hypertension as well as the increasing population of senior citizens. “There is no doubt that cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but at the same time, access to care and diagnostic tools has improved," said Dr Ajay Mahajan, head of the cardiology department at KEM Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Medical guidelines have since changed and even readings above 120 are considered hypertensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart care until a few years back mainly meant lipid-lowering medications, the prescriptions for other drugs meant to control unstable heart rhythm or heart failure have also increased. “Cardiovascular medications are interrelated because they target different but connected pathways of disease,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda. “For example, anti-hypertensives lower blood pressure to reduce the strain on arteries and the heart. Lipid-lowering drugs like statins reduce cholesterol helping prevent arterial blockages. Anti-anginals improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain caused by narrowed arteries. These medications are often prescribed together," said Dr Panda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the frequent reports of cardiac arrest deaths among common people as well as celebrities and fitness enthusiasts, KEM cardiologist Dr Charan Lanjewar said underlying factors are almost always involved. “There’s a lack of data to identify a single cause in many cardiac arrest cases. The reasons are multifactorial, but lifestyle, stress, and consumption habits play a vital role,” Dr Lanjewar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aging population is more prone to heart conditions. Senior cardiologist Dr Akshay Mehta said, “The lifespan of the Indian population has increased and with a growing aging population, we are seeing a higher incidence of heart disease. Along with rising incidence, we also have better diagnostic tools now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 22:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>编辑《花花公子》，与帕金森一起生活-《泰晤士报》 | Editing Playboy, living with Parkinson’s - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPazZ2X3FPb01lc1pwVEs5SVJzd3Vpemo4VWI2VGJ5a1llVlp1RFY0Y3RrRF9HUVZPR3JUQmgtS0hlWmJrdG1MaHZhdHV3bUlpRG8zeEp0OG1mMDBGTlBUY3VrTzMydDBPSXdNNHVETlFDcHAwdDAtWnhXOGpMQlBlTHhLZDgwWUF1ejh1YUdlV0pKRkNkdkx0Vnk0ZDhCd005bUI2MHUwZ0k2OGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It was among the “high rollers” at one such symposium that Jan Heemskerk, then the editor of Dutch Playboy, found his compatriot Playmate on set in floods of tears. Apparently, his star model and the photographer were at loggerheads. “I took the woman for a beer to talk it through,” recalls Heemskerk, 62. “It was literally only afterwards, as I walked away, that it dawned on me she was&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; completely naked. I thought: I’ve been in this job too long.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If Heemskerk — a well-known media figure who, before helming Playboy, launched the Dutch version of the lads’ monthly FHM and another glossy called MAN — was inured to the excesses of men’s publishing during its sozzled last hurrah in the Noughties, his family history may hold the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/lily-phillips-interview-sex-101-men-sxpfdhhkj" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lily Phillips: Don’t blame me for how men have sex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His father, Jan Heemskerk Sr, had been the editor of Dutch Playboy before him, even causing a political scandal in the mid-1980s when he published photographs of two (very!) liberal Dutch parliamentarians eyeing each other up in the House of Representatives, then disporting themselves in bed and in the shower. Heemskerk says his dad was less than enthusiastic about his son assuming the Playboy mantle — “F*** no” was his response to news of the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both men had dealings with Playboy’s founder, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/hugh-hefner-widow-crystal-marriage-brainswashed-wm0kzmh6c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Hugh Hefner&lt;/a&gt;. “He was a small guy — the translator towered over him but when he started talking he was mesmerising,” recalls the wiry Heemskerk. “He oozed power and intelligence … and then the other side of him was just a dirty old man.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.5"&gt;&lt;div id="12a72786-de23-4b3f-a8c3-a0527eeb5035"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;In his Playboy days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Heemskerk resigned in pique from his editorship of the Dutch organ in 2012, half a decade before the Playboy empire would have to reckon with fallout pertaining to the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/playboy-founder-high-hefner-accused-of-drugging-and-secretly-filming-bunnies-5ksxzsp8p" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;most sordid aspects of Hefner’s life&lt;/a&gt; — among them allegations of drugging, coercion and using his power to silence women — in the wake of #MeToo. During Heemskerk’s tenure, the principal challenge for Playboy was one of competing with what we shall euphemistically refer to as “the possibilities of the internet”. Newsstand cover lines from the period before his departure — “The jokes page is back!” — speak to escalating desperation in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The rustic home Heemskerk Jr shares with his wife, the De Volkskrant newspaper executive Corinne van Duin, is half an hour’s drive from Amsterdam in the village of Nederhorst den Berg and is a far cry from the Playboy Mansion. This being Dutch farmland, the water feature I must navigate is a bucolic dyke rather than a lagoon pool. In fact, the only clue to Heemskerk’s former life is a bunny-emblazoned security pass lanyard that now dangles from the charge card for the family’s small electric Fiat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These days, Heemskerk — who has three grown-up sons of his own — is an ambassador not for Playboy but for a certain defiant approach to having Parkinson’s disease, for which he has written a book: &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners&lt;/i&gt;. Its millennial pink cover shows a caricature of Heemskerk flipping the bird, his middle finger vibrating with the involuntary “shakes” that are the best-known manifestation of the disease. Heemskerk describes his approach as “on the offensive”. It wasn’t always this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/crystal-hefner-the-playboy-mansion-was-riddled-with-black-mould-6hthpsltr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Hefner: ‘The Playboy Mansion was riddled with black mould’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nine years into a post-Playboy portfolio career that included founding a short-lived crowdfunding platform for glamour photography, Heemskerk was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2021 after multiple people — a producer on a daytime TV show, his parents — noticed him staring into space or dragging his feet. He duly went to see his GP who, concerned by Heemskerk’s performance in a balance exercise, referred him to a neurologist in Hilversum, the town 15 minutes away that is the epicentre of the Netherlands’s media industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In “Hillywood” the Parkinson’s diagnosis came instantaneously, after which a shocked Heemskerk resolved to hunker down and exist in ignorance. It seemed to him uniquely unfair that he should be saddled with a degenerative disease after having cleaned his act up so comprehensively. Since leaving Playboy he had renounced his former routine of “parties that go on deep into the night, lots of red meat and alcohol” in a body-and-soul makeover chronicled via two self-help books published under the umbrella title &lt;i&gt;Als Jan het kan&lt;/i&gt; … (&lt;i&gt;If Jan Can Do It …&lt;/i&gt;). For the first book he reformed his diet, renounced booze and shed nearly four stone after Van Duin made disparaging remarks about his waistline. For the second he investigated meditation and other wellness practices in an attempt to cure the insomnia that had dogged him for years — something he now suspects may have been an early sign of Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Affronted by the diagnosis, he delegated all reading on the subject of Parkinson’s to Van Duin, who was instructed only to relay the “good” news — of which there seemed precious little. Then, after almost two years with his head in the sand, Heemskerk decided it was time to face up to the matter at hand. &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners &lt;/i&gt;is his attempt to make up for lost time and — in keeping with his new role as spokesperson for the Parkinson’s charity Parkinson NL — spread awareness about what is now the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world, affecting between seven and ten million people globally, with estimates predicting a doubling of cases by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.14"&gt;&lt;div id="befed110-3033-4e11-91ac-14db7b519971"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Jan Heemskerk Sr in 1977&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On a cellular level the disease is caused by the abnormal accumulation of a protein that prompts the death of nerve cells in a metabolically active part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a deficit in dopamine, a chemical that plays an important part in controlling movement and maintaining posture. Everything from memory and sight to swallowing and speech can be affected, and the standard treatment remains Levodopa, a dopamine replacement agent in use since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While there is a small hereditary component — if a first-degree relative has Parkinson’s, you have a 2.4 per cent chance of developing it, as opposed to 0.8 per cent otherwise — the biggest culprits by far, Heemskerk says, are likely to be environmental. Parkinson’s is emphatically a disease of industrialised nations, with pesticides likely playing a role. As with the wine-growing regions of France, residents of the celebrated Bollenstreek — the bulb-growing swathe of the Netherlands with vividly striped tulip fields that draw millions of visitors — have an elevated incidence of Parkinson’s, with farmers and gardeners as a group 2 to 2.5 times more likely to get the disease, according to Professor Bas Bloem of Radboud University in Nijmegen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/parkinsons-disease-symptoms-creativity-h9vz9sfmc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parkinson’s and me: on good days I convince myself that life is as it was&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Luckily, the Netherlands punches above its weight when it comes to Parkinson’s research. Leiden University Medical Centre is using the Netherlands Donor Faeces Bank to investigate whether faecal transplants can help slow the progression of Parkinson’s. And this year Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC) will launch Plants for Parkinson’s, a programme to investigate whether the positive impact of plant-based nutrition — which the hospital found could be just as effective as painkillers and anti-inflammatories in alleviating symptoms for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis — extends to Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keen to get ahead of the game, Heemskerk switched to a vegan diet in the course of writing this book and enlisted the Amsterdam Nutritional Assessment Center and a UMC-affiliated dietician to monitor his progress over several months. The results, detailed in the book, are encouraging, with Heemskerk showing marked improvement across metrics including hand-grip strength (an indication of overall muscle function) and a timed chair stand, which determines balance and risk of falling. The hardened carnivore party animal is now, by his own admission, “an advanced vegan”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Resplendent in charcoal grey athleisurewear, Heemskerk says he now feels overwhelmingly grateful for the midlife health kick that stood him in such good stead for his diagnosis. His beloved golf may no longer be viable (“I kept losing the ball”) but he has stuck with his Fit20 brand of high-intensity strength training and — a reformed dog-hater — delights in taking the family labradoodle, Pippa, for 10km walks. He has found solace in membership of a sea-shanty choir. But he’s not peddling &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/salt-path-scandal-how-it-happened-raynor-winn-wn0rb7w5n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salt Path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style miracles. In the book, he describes crying in frustration and admits that life with Parkinson’s can be tough: “I am borderline deaf, blind as a bat, always losing everything and never know what day of the week it is.” Today is the hottest day of the year and he’s clearly finding speech very difficult — with Van Duin stepping in to interpret when his stammer becomes too muddy for me to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is at his most animated when I ask about the causes of Parkinson’s and what he considers our collective complacency with regard to industrialised agriculture.

By analyzing brain scans from young adults, researchers found that individuals with higher levels of psychopathic traits showed distinctive patterns of structural connections in the brain. These patterns, in turn, were associated with behaviors that involve acting out, suggesting that the brain’s wiring might help explain some of the behavioral tendencies linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is often associated with impulsivity, aggression, and antisocial behavior. While past studies have focused heavily on how different brain regions function in people with psychopathic traits, less is known about how these regions are structurally connected. Structural connectivity refers to the physical links between brain areas—similar to the brain’s wiring system. The researchers aimed to go beyond earlier work that focused only on specific brain circuits and instead look across the entire brain to identify any structural patterns linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially interested in understanding whether structural differences in the brain might explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Previous models have suggested two possible brain-based explanations for these behaviors. One theory emphasizes problems in how people process emotional threats, while another highlights difficulties in attention control. Both theories have some support, but no study had comprehensively examined how structural brain networks might connect psychopathy with real-world behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 82 young adults who participated in the Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body study. All participants were screened to rule out medical or psychological conditions that might affect the results. Psychopathic traits were assessed using a questionnaire designed to capture both interpersonal-affective characteristics (like manipulation and lack of empathy) and behavioral traits (like impulsivity and rule-breaking). Externalizing behaviors were also measured with a separate questionnaire that included items on aggression, defiance, and similar tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent high-resolution brain imaging using diffusion MRI, a technique that maps the white matter tracts—essentially the brain’s wiring—connecting different regions. The researchers used a method called connectome-based predictive modeling, which relies on machine learning to identify patterns in the brain’s structural connectivity that relate to individual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method allowed them to identify two kinds of networks: positive networks, where stronger connections were linked to higher psychopathy scores, and negative networks, where weaker connections were related to those same scores. They also tested whether specific connections within these networks helped explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psychopathic traits were significantly associated with both stronger and weaker connections in different parts of the brain. The positive network—made up of connections that increased with psychopathy—was better at predicting psychopathic traits than the negative network alone. But when both networks were combined, the prediction became even more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the connections in the positive network were located within the brain’s frontal and parietal lobes, which are involved in decision-making, emotional processing, and attention. These connections included pathways like the uncinate fasciculus, which links the frontal cortex with areas involved in emotion, and the arcuate fasciculus, which supports language and auditory processing. Other connections involved the cingulum bundle, associated with emotional regulation and social behavior, and the posterior corticostriatal pathway, which plays a role in reward processing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the negative network involved fewer connections, notably in regions like the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus on the left side of the brain. These tracts are important for attention control and integrating information across different senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at whether specific connections in these networks could explain the link between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. They found that one connection in the right hemisphere—part of a tract involved in emotion recognition—was associated with both psychopathy and higher levels of externalizing behavior. A second connection in the left hemisphere—related to attention control—was linked to both psychopathy and lower levels of these behaviors. Mediation analyses suggested that these two connections acted as pathways through which psychopathic traits might influence externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that structural differences in how the brain is connected may play a role in how psychopathic traits are expressed behaviorally. Some connections—especially those involved in emotion and reward processing—may contribute to difficulties in recognizing and responding to social and emotional cues, which could make aggressive or impulsive behaviors more likely. Other connections, especially those related to attention control, may affect a person’s ability to process competing information, potentially influencing how they respond in complex or emotionally charged situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that people with higher psychopathic traits did not always show weaker brain connections. In fact, some brain networks showed increased connectivity. This is different from earlier findings that have mostly focused on reduced structural integrity in white matter. The current study used a different measurement—counting the number of streamlines between regions—which may capture broader patterns of connection rather than subtle changes in tissue structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also emphasized that the results support a dual-pathway model of psychopathy. One pathway involves problems with emotional processing, and the other involves attention control. These two types of brain circuits may work independently or together to influence how psychopathic traits are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer new insight into the brain’s role in psychopathy, there are several limitations. The participants in the study were young adults from the general population, and most had relatively low levels of externalizing behaviors. This limits how much the results can be applied to people with more severe or clinical forms of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not include behavioral or cognitive tasks that could directly link the brain’s structural features to performance in real-world situations. Including such tasks in future studies could help clarify how these brain differences translate into specific deficits in emotional or attentional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study treated psychopathy as a single dimension. But research suggests that different components of psychopathy—such as callousness versus impulsivity—may be linked to different brain circuits. Future studies could look at how structural connectivity relates to specific traits or subtypes of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study’s sample size was relatively small, and the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations, including those with higher levels of psychopathic traits or histories of criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70158" target="_blank"&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Peiyang Guo, Cheng Cheng, and Xiangyi Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 20:20:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa1RmT1dUN0xmWnpMalFZTU9vV3ZyMHA0UW9tTG12Y3lZWjU1blJBQW52S1diWnd3QVBFcG9VWmNmZG82dU1PZ0RzX0V1NXlfVTBTSG1Fa2s4bDUtWWE1VUhVeTRTVEZsYjFBSUN6SEJoVE10SFBvQmVQNkRSLWJ0dVI4UnNPbDNNQXpTd29fOWU4NHJ4anpHWVlZMWRJOUtabmkwWFBkRkEwbzQ</guid></item><item><title>卫报对线粒体捐赠的看法：试管婴儿创新导致谨慎的基因胜利|社论-卫报 | The Guardian view on mitochondrial donation: IVF innovation leads to a cautious genetic triumph | Editorial - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPNDNucG05UnJmV0VNTW5jR21hM1ZyQlZUZ3NEeEZTcXd2Rjd3dFNCNjNZb0QxbjMydUF4Yi02NlNjUGlacTFNQzBiZlJwR0gwMUcweUhEbG9zOGEyRmNWS014TVU1NUVXeFNpWXpZUHVYLTZHU3I3NzEyaXAySXQ1T0ZTZGsxNnlwYVYtRzQxUnRRMjhWUldUTTE3X0Rwdmc1LUhSbGdrU3BOUGF2d0VYUGFyamlQUnFMNy0wNC1wWDF6ckV0MGxSVFpXUy1QOGlxVVFrNkI2SFJQd2tlUjM3VF9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/16/eight-healthy-babies-born-after-ivf-using-dna-from-three-people" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Eight babies&lt;/a&gt; have been born free of a disease that can lead to terrible suffering and early death, thanks to pioneering scientists in the UK employing a form of genetic engineering that is banned in some countries, including the US and France. Ten years ago, when the government and regulators were considering whether to allow mitochondrial transfer technology, critics warned of “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/15/mitochondrial-disease-gene-cure-ivf#:~:text=The%20technique%20involves%20taking%20an,has%20worked%20in%20animal%20studies." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Frankenstein meddling&lt;/a&gt;” that would lead to three-parent children. It’s hard now to justify such hostility in the face of the painstaking work carried out by the scientific and medical teams at Newcastle, resulting in these healthy babies and ecstatic families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria, like tiny battery packs, supply energy to every cell of the body. Their DNA is handed down in the egg from mother to child. In rare instances, there are genetic mutations, which means the baby may develop &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02276-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mitochondrial disease&lt;/a&gt;. About one in 5,000 people is affected by it, making it one of the most common inherited disorders. As the cell batteries fail in various organs, the child can experience a range of symptoms, from muscle weakness to epilepsy, encephalopathy, blindness, hearing loss and diabetes. In severe cases, they die young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"commentisfree","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"Blog","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/genetics","type":"Keyword","title":"Genetics"},{"id":"society/ivf","type":"Keyword","title":"IVF"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"education/newcastleuniversity","type":"Keyword","title":"Newcastle University"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/biology","type":"Keyword","title":"Biology"},{"id":"science/reproduction","type":"Keyword","title":"Reproduction"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/editorials","type":"Tone","title":"Editorials"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"profile/editorial","type":"Contributor","title":"Editorial"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/opinion","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Letters and Leader Writers"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"commentisfree/2025/jul/20/the-guardian-view-on-mitochondrial-donation-ivf-innovation-leads-to-a-cautious-genetic-triumph","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no cure yet, so the aim is prevention. Women who have some damaged and some healthy mitochondria can have IVF and pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) to select embryos that are clear of mutations or only slightly affected. The options for women with 100% mutated mitochondria used to be limited to donated eggs or adoption – until parliament changed the rules to allow the technology in 2015 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/16/first-licence-to-create-three-person-baby-granted-by-uk-fertility-regulator" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Newcastle Fertility Centre&lt;/a&gt; was granted a licence by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to use it in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The process does indeed involve three people. The would-be mother’s egg and a donor egg are both fertilised by the man’s sperm. The nucleus of the donated egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus of the woman’s egg, but its healthy mitochondria remain. This composite egg is inserted into the woman’s uterus. The resulting baby’s DNA will be 99.9% from the parents and only 0.1% from the donor. &lt;a href="https://www.eara.eu/post/mitochondrial-donation-the-animal-research-that-paved-the-way" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Hardly a three-parent child.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet there are controversies. Some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_germline_engineering" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; will not permit use of the technology because of concerns over human germline genetic modification. The lab-mixed DNA will be passed to future generations, with who knows what consequences. And a question hangs over something called reversal, or reversion. The results of the Newcastle research published in the New England Journal of Medicine show that some of the embryos with healthy donated mitochondria developed mutations somewhere along the line. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-two-papers-on-the-use-of-mitochondrial-donation-and-preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-mitochondrial-disease-as-published-in-nejm/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mutations formed in 12% of one baby’s mitochondria and 16% in another’s&lt;/a&gt;. That was not enough to affect the babies, who were healthy, but previous work by other scientists has suggested that mutations can increase with time, and nobody yet understands why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Newcastle scientists and medics have been highly praised for their slow and methodical work. They have brought joy to some families and hope to others. But this is still experimental technology and caution is absolutely valid. And inevitably there are cost issues. People who can afford it will no doubt pay, but the &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/12/mitochondrial-donation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://cdn.nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/Novel_techniques_for_the_prevention_of_mitochondrial_DNA_disorders.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unlikely&lt;/a&gt; to be able to help the rest. Nonetheless, this groundbreaking research must surely be allowed to continue, albeit only in the same careful fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 20:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPNDNucG05UnJmV0VNTW5jR21hM1ZyQlZUZ3NEeEZTcXd2Rjd3dFNCNjNZb0QxbjMydUF4Yi02NlNjUGlacTFNQzBiZlJwR0gwMUcweUhEbG9zOGEyRmNWS014TVU1NUVXeFNpWXpZUHVYLTZHU3I3NzEyaXAySXQ1T0ZTZGsxNnlwYVYtRzQxUnRRMjhWUldUTTE3X0Rwdmc1LUhSbGdrU3BOUGF2d0VYUGFyamlQUnFMNy0wNC1wWDF6ckV0MGxSVFpXUy1QOGlxVVFrNkI2SFJQd2tlUjM3VF9n</guid></item><item><title>据营养师介绍，最佳减肥高蛋白午餐- EatingWell | The Best High-Protein Lunch for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNYzV4UUxhaU5ZaXFXaExaeVAwSlJaeXQ0cXdvWkVKVGNaZC1hU2p2QUJWcWpXdGVzcVRzSFVRWjVXaHpKcU5CTVR4eXBhTnZseGpBVjg4cHpPZHlhVy1xOXNtV2VaYkp0dFh6T1hpSmpDa1dHVXQyVk1ka3lSUmM1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This high-protein chicken salad sandwich provides energy and keeps you feeling full longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tasty ingredients like Greek yogurt and sun-dried tomatoes make this healthy lunch fun and satisfying to eat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can enjoy this meal in different ways—on bread, in a salad or stuffed in veggies—so it never gets boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There may come a time in your life or that of a loved one where weight loss becomes a goal. It might have nothing to do with vanity, either. The emotional and physical toll of daily life can affect our health and weight. Whether it’s overeating as a way to cope with the loss of a job, or bingeing on junk food to manage the stress of taking care of family, we often turn to food for comfort. Luckily, there are strategies that can help you manage both your weight and your overall health. One of the best weight-loss strategies is choosing to enjoy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meals rich in nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that provide energy and promote satiety. One of my favorite lunch recipes that leans into that strategy is this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-chicken-salad-sandwich-11687670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s why I think it’s the best lunch for weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-the-marry-me-chicken-salad-sandwich-is-the-best-lunch-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why the Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich Is the Best Lunch for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason I love this lunch is that it’s packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. It provides more than 40 grams of protein per sandwich, thanks to the chicken and Greek yogurt. But why is protein so important for weight loss? &lt;a href="https://www.christywilsonnutrition.com/menu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christy Wilson, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says, “When it comes to weight loss, protein helps keep us feeling full and satisfied long after we’ve eaten.”  Wilson cites a recent study where participants did lose weight when protein was 16% to 45% of total calories consumed. High-protein diets appeared to increase satiety and energy expenditure while improving body composition by increasing the amount of fat-free mass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Ultra-Satisfying &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The protein makes the meal satisfying, but so does how it’s packaged. The chicken salad, for starters, is made with flavorful ingredients like tangy Greek yogurt and slightly sweet sun-dried tomatoes. There’s also the arugula, which adds color and a bright, peppery bite. Finally, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8045858/whole-grain-bread-vs-whole-wheat-bread/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-wheat bread provides texture&lt;/a&gt; as well as a variety of nutrients, including fiber, which benefits health and boosts satiety. Each bite is as delicious and satisfying as the next!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Be Enjoyed in a Variety of Ways &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love meals that can be reinterpreted or modified for enjoyment in other ways. This chicken salad sandwich is one of those meals. For example, during the warmer summer months, I prefer to serve the chicken salad over lettuce and include other seasonal vegetables as part of the meal. In the fall and winter, I’ll enjoy it as a sandwich but swap the bread for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sourdough-or-whole-wheat-bread-better-for-gut-health-11771656" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough or something whole-grain and hearty&lt;/a&gt; from my local bakery. Or I’ll stuff the chicken salad into a bell pepper and broil for a few minutes to enjoy it warm. Being able to reinvent the dish means I can enjoy it several ways without getting bored!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-things-to-do-to-help-support-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Things to Do to Help Support Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to consider the food you eat when it comes to weight loss, but there are other things you can do, even during lunchtime, to help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy your lunch with co-workers:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating by yourself or sitting at your desk staring at a screen is fine occasionally, but if you have the opportunity, I suggest &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025502/cooking-and-eating-together-impact-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dining with co-workers&lt;/a&gt;. Sitting down and talking with people during your meal gives you an excuse to slow down and enjoy your food while enjoying the company of others. This is good for digestion as well as boosting your mood—both of which can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a walk:&lt;/strong&gt; Either before or after your lunch, consider going on a walk. The benefits of movement go beyond weight loss, as research has proven &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;exercise makes you feel good&lt;/a&gt; and gives you energy. If a walk isn’t an option, consider finding some stairs to conquer, or just take a few laps around the office or your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sip water:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration plays a powerful role in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-drinking-water-help-you-lose-weight-11725115" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the opposite, dehydration, can trick your mind into thinking you’re hungry versus thirsty. Good hydration means you’ll feel better too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a mindful reset: &lt;/strong&gt;Use your lunch break as a time to hit the mental “reset” button. Use a wellness app to find a quick mediation to help you relax or do some deep-breathing exercises to clear your mind. Taking a moment to center yourself can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;prevent mindless eating&lt;/a&gt; or overeating and help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-habit-to-lose-weight-11766982" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;listen to your body’s cues for hunger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strategies you can use when looking to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. A great one is enjoying a lunch that’s delicious and satisfying. Choosing something high in protein that includes a variety of ingredients and textures is a great option, like my favorite Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich. But remember, it’s not the only way. Be sure to include movement and socialization time in your plan. Stay hydrated and carve out some time for a midday reset. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And remember, says &lt;a href="https://www.resetlifestyle.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wintana Kiros, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: While protein is the foundation that helps you feel full, preserves your muscle and keeps you strong during weight loss, you also need fiber-rich carbs, healthy fats and anti-inflammatory foods like colorful plants to bring balance. So don’t exclude these other foods, she says. “Think of protein as your anchor, not your entire ship.”&lt;br&gt;

By recording brain activity in epilepsy patients watching a TV episode, they found ripples marked event boundaries in the hippocampus while supporting information processing in cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This segmentation acts like punctuation, helping organize experiences into coherent episodes. The findings may inform therapies for memory impairments by targeting how the brain structures information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripple Waves Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Ripples mark memory episode boundaries in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturalistic Context:&lt;/strong&gt; Study captured ripple dynamics during real-life-like experience watching a TV show.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could guide strategies for memory disorders by enhancing information segmentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research team from the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Barcelona, the UB Institute of Neurosciences (UBneuro) and the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) has identified, for the first time in humans, and in a realistic environment, a key neurophysiological mechanism in memory formation: ripple-type brain waves —high-frequency electrical oscillations that mark and organize the different episodes or fragments of information that the brain stores as memories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, deepen our understanding of how memory is organized in the human brain and open up new avenues for addressing disorders related to memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111797"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/brain-ripple-memory-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results could also have important implications for understanding memory disorders and developing future therapeutic interventions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is led by Lluís Fuentemilla, a researcher at the IDIBELL and UBneuro Cognition and Brain Plasticity research group, and is part of the doctoral thesis carried out in this same group by Marta Silva, the article’s first author, who is currently at Columbia University (United States). Experts from the Epilepsy Unit at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona – August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Columbia University, Ruhr University Bochum and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany) also participated in the study.&lt;br&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;br&gt;The recollection of specific episodes is the basis of memory. Although experience is constant, there is evidence that the brain segments it when there are changes in the flow of information to convert it into memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These segments mark the point at which the brain closes one episode in memory and begins recording another. For example, when you are doing something and you receive a phone call or the doorbell rings, the brain identifies that there has been a change in the course of the experience and uses these events as if they were punctuation marks, a full stop in a sentence, to proceed to store what you were doing in the form of an episode”, says Lluís Fuentemilla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous studies in mice have indicated that ripples play a fundamental role in memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These waves are thought to coordinate information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortical regions — the temporal and frontal cortex — helping to integrate new memories. This neural signal is key to generating synaptic potentiation, allowing the brain to fix and consolidate a memory”, note the researchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pioneering experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although these signals have been extensively studied in animals, especially mice, their analysis in humans has been very limited. This is due to the difficulty of recording them, as they originate in brain areas that require the use of intracranial electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, however, researchers have managed to analyse these waves in a naturalistic context, i.e. in conditions close to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, they recorded the intracranial electrophysiological activity of ten patients with epilepsy — who had undergone surgery for clinical reasons — while they watched the first episode of the BBC series&lt;em&gt; Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;, which lasts 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of narrative format, as in real life, features scene changes that the brain identifies as event boundaries. The participants were then asked to recall and recount what they remembered of the plot”, the authors explain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed a dynamic pattern of ripple wave activation during memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that these waves occurred in both the hippocampus and neocortical areas. However, they followed a different temporal rhythm: in the hippocampus, ripple activity increased at the boundaries of events, reflecting their role in segmentation; in contrast, in cortical regions, their presence was higher during the internal development of events”, says Marta Silva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;​​​​​​​According to the researchers, this pattern suggests coordination between the two brain structures, as if they were “an orchestra”: the neocortical regions actively process information, and the hippocampus kicks in when there is a change of scene to “pack and consolidate” the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segmenting to remember&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings reinforce the idea of the importance of segmentation and structuring in memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we see, both in this study and in related work, is that it is not enough to pay attention and record information, but that it is equally or more important to organize it in the context of the constant flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, it is not just a matter of activating the brain’s machinery while it is recording information, but also of acting as an orchestra conductor who marks when the memory begins and ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These signals help not only to record what is happening as it happens, but also to organize the information coherently”, they point out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results could also have important implications for understanding memory disorders and developing future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To date, when faced with an amnesic problem, we thought of attention deficits or difficulties in acquiring information. Our results suggest that there could also be a failure in these segmentation signals, in how information is structured in the brain”, they note.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this sense, the study opens the door to exploring therapies that consider how information is organized at the brain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In older people, for example, who are beginning to show memory impairment, it could be beneficial to present information in a more structured way, with clear pauses between relevant events. Not only as a matter of cognitive rhythm, but because this could facilitate its correct encoding and storage”, they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dba9b4a8bab6baa9afb2b5bea19baeb9f5bebfae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rosa Martínez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ub.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rosa Martínez – University of Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60788-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A naturalistic study reveals ripples in the human temporal cortex track episodic memory formation&lt;/a&gt;” by Lluís Fuentemilla et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A naturalistic study reveals ripples in the human temporal cortex track episodic memory formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripples are fast oscillatory events widely recognized as crucial markers for memory consolidation and neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These transient bursts of activity are thought to coordinate information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortical areas, providing a temporal framework that supports the stabilization and integration of new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed a differential dynamical pattern of ripple occurrence during encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation, whereas higher ripple rates were seen within an event for cortical electrodes with higher ripple occurrence at the temporal cortex, reflecting whether an event was later recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the potential role of ripples in the encoding of an event, suggesting an impact on the formation of long-term memories of distinct episodes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 18:53:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1yMlZYVlhBV0V4QmhpcDA5YURHLWVMbUQwNWFKTXp5SHBHd1NXX3lGTGY4TXJYR0dnZmhRbjFOQmo3T2xuNWFzZElyMkp2U1ozSTBXeURiR1NXODlTZjM3R1BaQ21DMEpKa0V0Rw</guid></item></channel></rss>
