Researchers from Mass General Brigham found that when applying the new criteria, which expands upon the traditional use of body mass index (BMI) to include measures of body fat distribution, the prevalence of obesity increased from about 40 percent to about 70 percent among over 300,000 people included in their study. The rise was even more pronounced among older adults. Additionally, the researchers found that those newly added individuals also had a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Their results are published in &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.37619?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=101525\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;JAMA Network Open&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding,” said co-first author Lindsay Fourman, MD, an endocrinologist in the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. “With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Traditionally, obesity has been defined by BMI, which estimates body fat based on a person’s weight and height. But other anthropomorphic measures—such as waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, or waist-to-hip ratio—may further account for fat distribution and aid in differentiation between muscle and fat mass.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Under the new framework, a person is classified as having obesity if they have a high BMI plus at least one elevated anthropometric measure (a condition the authors term “BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity”), or if they have a normal BMI and at least two elevated anthropometric measures (a condition termed “anthropometric-only obesity”). The new definition also distinguishes between preclinical and clinical obesity with clinical obesity defined as the presence of obesity-related physical impairment or organ dysfunction. At least 76 organizations have endorsed the new guidelines, including the American Heart Association and The Obesity Society.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study analyzed participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program’s cohort of over 300,000 Americans. Obesity prevalence was 68.6 percent with the new definition, versus 42.9 percent under the traditional BMI-based definition. This increase was entirely driven by inclusion of individuals with anthropometric-only obesity. Obesity rates varied by sex, race, and especially by age—affecting nearly 80 percent of adults over 70.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Importantly, the study found that those with anthropometric-only obesity – who would not have been classified as having obesity by the traditional definition – had a higher risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality than people without obesity. About half of all individuals who met the new obesity criteria had clinical obesity, and this proportion was only slightly lower in the anthropometric-only obesity group compared with the BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity group.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We have always recognized the limitations of BMI as a single marker for obesity because it doesn't take into account body fat distribution,” said senior author Steven Grinspoon, MD, Chief of the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. “Seeing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this new group of people with obesity, who were not considered to have obesity before, brings up interesting questions about obesity medications and other therapeutics.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to better understand the causes of and optimal treatments for anthropometric-only obesity. The research team previously developed a therapeutic that reduces waist circumference and plans to explore the utility of different treatment strategies in this newly defined population.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Identifying excess body fat is very important as we’re finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk,” Fourman said. “Body composition matters – it’s not just pounds on a scale.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;quot;}}" id="text-d86e812d13" class="cmp-text"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers studied a new definition of obesity that moves beyond BMI to include measures of body fat distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applying the updated criteria to a national study population revealed a nearly 60 percent rise in obesity prevalence, affecting up to 80 percent of older adults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The prevalence of obesity in the United States could rise sharply under a new definition of obesity released earlier this year by the&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/clinical-obesity"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are overweight but have good muscle strength may be less likely to develop obesity-related heart, liver or kidney damage, new research has suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite a growing body of evidence that excess body fat can directly cause illnesses, from heart disease to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-40bdf8b0-a9b2-11f0-93ac-c9db3c873251"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, experts now say obese people with good grip strength may be less likely to die early, and are better protected against disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grip strength—which measures the force with which someone can squeeze an object—has long been considered a good indicator of physical health, with higher scores indicating a reduced risk of heart disease, arthritis and even certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now researchers, from Pennington Biomedical Research Center, say it's a 'powerful, early sign of who is most at risk' of developing obesity-related diseases among people with excess body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, using an individual's height and weight to assess their potential health risks, excess body fat refers to an abnormal build-up of fatty tissue that has an adverse affect on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;researchers looked at 93,275 participants from the UK Biobank with excess body fat—also known as preclinical obesity—to determine the link between grip strength and the development of obesity-related health issues or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that participants with a stronger hand-grip were significantly less likely to develop obesity and die during a follow-up period of just over 13 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yun Shen, an expert in metabolic disease and study lead author, said: 'This protective link was consistent in multiple checks using other muscle metrics, including the muscle-to-weight and lean-to weight ratios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People with excess body fat but more muscle may be less likely to develop organ damage or die from obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because grip strength is easy to measure and strength can be improved with weight training, the research points to a practical, low-cost way to identify at-risk individuals and to act early,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test your grip strength at home, experts suggest attempting to grip a heavy weight or object—around three quarters of your bodyweight, for one minute straight without any interruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the average man, this means selecting a weight that is around 85kg, while form women its 54kg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, 60 seconds should be easy enough, whilst 30 seconds is a reasonable target for women—with anything less than this indicating an increased risk of premature mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grip strength has long been used by doctors to identify patients at risk of developing various health problems early on, including cardiovascular disease and even dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14530873/Simple-DIY-test-die-early-health-expert-warns.html"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;involving nearly 7,000 people by University College London found that those who had weaker grip strength at the start of the 17-year study had a higher-than-average rate of premature death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another analysis of previous research, with nearly 140,000 people, found that weak grip strength is a more accurate predictor for early death than high blood pressure, reported The Lancet in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to one study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning last year, those with the least muscle strength were almost 150 per cent more likely to die early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A hand dynamometer is used to measure isometric grip force (hand grip strength)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To improve grip strength, the NHS advises performing muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups—including legs, hips, back,. abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms—at least twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No specific amount of time is recommended, but exercises should be performed to the point at which another repetition would be difficult without help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These may include push ups, bicep curls, glute bridges, squats and tricep dips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as new research has suggested that just five minutes of exercise twice a day can help boost heart health—especially for those who lead sedentary lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found that brief bursts of activity can significantly improve cardiovascular fitness, a key measure of how the heart, lungs and blood vessels deliver oxygen to the muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This effect was also true for obese people, suggesting that improving muscle strength could help protect against a number of obesity-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the British Liver Trust has estimated that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) may affect up to 40 per cent of people in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with MASLD have excess fat in their liver and one or more metabolic risk factors, which can include obesity, high blood sugar and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one in four patients has a more advanced form called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this condition, fat buildup has led to inflammation, cell damage and, in some cases, liver scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 1 in 5 people with MASH will progress to cirrhosis — advanced, irreversible scarring of the liver — which can lead to liver failure and increase the risk of liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When liver function starts to decline, though, patients can accumulate fluid in the abdomen, develop jaundice or experience confusion caused by a buildup of toxins in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;One of the pillars of modern medicine is showing its cracks, according to a new report from the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have turned once deadly infections into minor inconveniences. They make lifesaving interventions, from surgery to chemotherapy, safer. But every time this powerful tool gets used, there's a risk — antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Out of the billions of bacteria causing an infection in an individual, some small fraction may be naturally resistant to a given drug. Taking an antibiotic can clear the field for those resistant bacteria to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is just basic evolution," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/kevin.ikuta" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kevin Ikuta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician and researcher at UCLA. He says we need antibiotics, but "we are in this battle we're trying to lose as slowly as possible anytime we treat an infection."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Humans are losing that battle faster than previously thought. In 2023, roughly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B09585" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1 in 6 infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tested by labs worldwide were resistant to antibiotic treatment, according to WHO. The report says nearly 40% of antibiotics used to treat common urinary, gut, blood and sexually-transmitted infections have lost effectiveness over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Frankly, it's quite concerning," says &lt;a href="https://onehealthtrust.org/researchers/ramanan_laxminarayan/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ramanan Laxminarayan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president of One Health Trust, a non-profit. "We do see increases in resistance every year, but here we see a pretty sharp increase."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance is already directly responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.2 million deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a year and contributes to nearly 5 million, according to WHO. That toll could grow, says Laxminarayan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're sleepwalking into a disaster," he says. "I shouldn't say we are — we already have sleepwalked into a disaster."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot spots of resistance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The jump in resistance was sharpest in low- and middle-income countries with weaker health systems, the report found. Countries with less robust systems to track &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/14/853984869/antibiotic-resistance-is-still-a-top-health-worry-its-a-pandemic-worry-too" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tended to report higher levels, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For some of the most common infections that afflict tropical countries, nearly 50 to 60% of the infections are now drug resistant," says Laxminarayan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These higher numbers could reflect biased data, where weak surveillance systems only pick up the worst infections that are more likely to be resistant to antibiotics. But they could also reflect genuinely higher levels of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's probably both," says Laxminarayan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Weak surveillance systems tend to be coupled with weaker health systems. That means "you probably have less infection prevention and control, less vaccination, weaker water and sanitation system," he says, which can breed resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Easier access to basic antibiotics could be playing a role too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You don't necessarily need a prescription to get an antibiotic in a lot of countries," says Ikuta. That can lead to misuse, for instance &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/05/29/g-s1-1647/covid-pandemic-superbugs-antibiotic-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;treating a viral infection with antibiotics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which could give resistant bacteria a leg up without providing any therapeutic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less access, more resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While misuse is a problem in lower-income countries, the bigger problem is that effective antibiotics — especially those that wealthier countries use when more basic ones fail — are often out of reach for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the U.S., if the first two drugs didn't work for you, likely you could afford the third drug," says Laxminarayan. "That option is not available to someone living in Cote d'Ivoire or The Gambia." That can leave infections insufficiently treated, ultimately fueling the fire of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those dynamics are part of what's driving &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/11/07/1209109088/antibiotics-that-fight-deadly-infections-in-babies-are-losing-their-power" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics — especially carbapenems and fluoroquinolones — that target a wide range of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As resistance to those first-choice antibiotics grows, physicians are left with older and more potentially toxic medications, or newer drugs that aren't widely available, especially in lower-income countries, says Ikuta. "So we're either left with an untreatable infection or with a treatment where the side effects may be as toxic as the infection itself," he says. "It's quite the pickle, clinically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Getting out of that pickle won't be easy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For one, it'll require a clearer global picture of resistance. While more countries are submitting data to WHO to help track global resistance levels, there are still major gaps.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Last year, 48% of countries didn't report any resistance data to WHO. Among the countries that did, nearly half still lack robust surveillance systems, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Better surveillance data can help physicians narrow down which antibiotics to use, ensuring more effective treatments that minimize resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Physicians also need newer, better antibiotics. Developing drugs that target bacteria in novel ways can help humans get ahead of resistance, but &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the global pipeline of new treatments isn't flowing fast enough to meet the need.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking, says Ikuta. If progress isn't made and resistance continues to grow, medical care we take for granted could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not just the treatment of acute infections and sepsis, it's making sure surgery is safe and effective, and chemotherapy is available," he says "These advancements in medicine are on the back of antibiotics, so when we lose antibiotics, we risk losing those."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Each sample helps us track the spread of the disease and informs our strategies to manage it effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shea said he feared a “domino effect” if CWD took hold in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hunters have to send a head in for testing, they’re waiting on the meat, and if it comes back positive they have to discard the meat,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So we’re fearful the number of hunters of white-tailed deer will drop. Hunters are the major way we control deer populations in many areas of the country and if that goes away you’re still going to have high numbers of deer, [but] there’s going to be bigger impacts on vehicle strikes, and crop depredation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hunters provide one of the largest revenue sources that supports all fish and wildlife management in North America and if fewer hunters are hunting there’s less money that comes in to seed programs that help all wildlife, not just white-tailed deer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOdGMzNU9qeGMtNTRVNV9LaldrMTlZWnZIZ2ZSYU16TGtQTGlMZG1qMEswZ2MwQWVhaFRsb0lMVGh4WFZGVFJUVUtENHh0bDFfMW5tUkdCeDZyX3owamozd0JjU1FNQ3BtejRLeVIweVZaSW9WQVB1UGZJYnJLSEVESQ</guid></item><item><title>呼吸道病毒季节已经到来。今年接种疫苗的注意事项- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/health/flu-covid-season-vaccine-tips-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            It’s that time of year when the leaves are turning golden, there’s a chill in the air and the threat of respiratory viruses like Covid-19, influenza or RSV looms across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000a3b6nkhif38ry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the 2025-26 fall and winter respiratory disease season to have a similar number of peak hospitalizations due to Covid-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus as there were last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But there are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill with any of those circulating viruses this year – and vaccination plays a key role.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “One question or comment I get all the time from my own patients is, ‘Dr. Ren, I got the flu vaccine last year, or I got the Covid vaccine last year, but I still got Covid, or I still got the flu.

            “What I tell them is, if I get the flu shot and someone with the flu sneezes on me and I’m in direct contact, I may still get sick, but it would be a much lighter version of illness,” he said. “Vaccines are not just disease prevention, but it’s to prevent you from getting a severe form of the disease that sends you to the hospital or worse. Flu every year and Covid every year still cause significant mortality in the country.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The CDC estimates that about 1 million people were hospitalized with the flu last season, and there were up to 130,000 flu deaths, based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary data&lt;/a&gt; from October 2024 through May 2025. Similar &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggest that from October 2024 through September 2025, there have been almost 540,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations and up to 63,000 Covid-19 deaths.

            Here’s what to know about getting this season’s Covid-19, flu and RSV vaccinations.

            The CDC says people 6 months and older - including pregnant people - should consult a health care provider to get an updated Covid-19 vaccine this season. It’s a shift away from the broader push in previous years for most people to get a Covid-19 shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000j3b6nt8uns5yc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The difference this year is that there’s not an explicit recommendation by the federal government to get the booster,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000k3b6nf1jnz2xn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This fall, the CDC has not explicitly recommended the Covid-19 vaccine but has made it available to everybody 6 months and older in a process called shared-decision making, which means that people are supposed to talk to a health care provider about the risks and benefits,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgld2jcb00003b6n069lgtyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Types of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001933.htm" target="_blank"&gt;health care providers&lt;/a&gt; may include people like physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and physician assistants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000l3b6nqxyskqhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are three types of Covid-19 vaccines available in the US: Pfizer for ages 5 and older, Moderna for 6 months and older, and Novavax for 12 and older. Pfizer and Moderna’s shots use mRNA technology, and Novavax’s version is a protein-based vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl99n1r001z3b6n74p073bp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year’s vaccines have been updated to target coronavirus strains circulating more recently, and they are available at most pharmacies, some doctors offices and certain public health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000n3b6nfsubspc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many pharmaceutical places like your Walgreens or CVS should carry it,” said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Johns Hopkins and a spokesperson with the American Lung Association, who is author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/33262/medicine-greater-good?c" target="_blank"&gt;Medicine for the Greater Good&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000o3b6n3cc88o2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the CDC finalized the new recommendation this year, access to Covid-19 shots had differed from state to state as pharmacies and providers navigated new federal vaccine policies. CVS, which had previously limited access to Covid-19 shots in some places, said last week that it was “updating our systems to be able to offer the updated COVID-19 vaccines to patients nationwide” and that “prescriptions from outside prescribers will no longer be required in any states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000q3b6ndtkw85sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who may have questions about where to find updated Covid-19 vaccines in their area or how to get their children vaccinated, Galiatsatos suggested directing questions to their local city or county health department or finding a large academic medical center in their area where they may be able to receive the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000r3b6niyp72gvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And what we usually say is to get the updated vaccine that usually comes out in the fall, get it once it’s available, and then talk with your doctor if you should consider getting boosted in about six months,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000s3b6nnrcdocix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sarah Dupont, a family medicine physician at Emory Healthcare and assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine, recommends getting the Covid shot in October or early November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000t3b6nm89bttbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At least a few weeks before Thanksgiving, to be sure you are protected over the holidays. If you have had a COVID-19 infection recently, however, you probably want to delay your booster as you already have a boost in immunity,” Dupont said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000u3b6nktyk4wft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For most eligible people with insurance, vaccinations may be covered, but “a COVID booster at a retail pharmacy is about $220 without insurance,” Dupont added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnx1p0000003b6njflxze5n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The nation’s largest trade association for health insurers said its members – which cover more than 200 million Americans – indicated that the new CDC recommendations would not have an impact on policyholders’ coverage through the end of 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgny57z300053b6n987f42ki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement in September that its members would continue to cover all immunizations that the CDC’s advisory committee recommended as of September 1 at no cost to patients. This includes the updated Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000v3b6n7lxqwcmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year’s updated Covid-19 vaccines were found to be about 39% effective against Covid-19 hospitalizations and about 64% against Covid-19 deaths, according to a study of US veterans published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The Covid-19 vaccines do a better job at preventing severe disease than they do preventing mild infection, and so people at higher risk of severe disease benefit the most from the boosters,” Barouch said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h4" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmgl9bqth002b3b6n78dxi0j2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="can-you-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-flu-shot-at-the-same-time" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Can you get a Covid vaccine and flu shot at the same time?
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl9bo6200293b6nyireglii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 vaccines can be given at the same time as a seasonal flu shot, if people prefer to get both at once.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000x3b6n7o9ip1v0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no recommendations against it other than just personal preference,” Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7000y3b6n5ot10d0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With a lot of the vaccines, a lot of people may say they feel a little bit of fatigue,” he said of some of the side effects. “So if you’re getting multiple shots all at the same time, that effect could kind of compound.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700103b6ntkajnr5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people 6 months and older &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;should get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; every season, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700113b6nsotsl26b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For flu, there is no change from prior years in terms of guidelines,” Barouch said. “And according to the CDC, the annual seasonal flu vaccine is recommended universally for everybody 6 months and older.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700123b6nk6f5cmir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people need only one dose of the flu vaccine each year. But some children who are getting the vaccine for the first time should get two doses, spaced four weeks apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700143b6n9i03gf38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It won’t be clear how effective this season’s flu vaccine is until after the season has ended. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine was about 42% to 56% effective in adults during the 2024-25 respiratory virus season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700153b6nysfbcb54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu has a seasonality. That’s why we update it every year,” Galiatsatos said. “I usually recommend trying to get the vaccine at least two weeks before Thanksgiving, just so you can build up the immunity, because flu really kicks in in November and December and sometimes lingers into January, February, March.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700163b6nc07hohfy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            September and October are considered generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html" target="_blank"&gt;good times to get the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC, and ideally eligible people should be vaccinated by the end of October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700173b6nswxe44mc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So get the flu vaccine now, if you haven’t already,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro700193b6nark1k7ic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some public health experts describe this as “&lt;a href="https://emscimprovement.center/news/flu-boo/" target="_blank"&gt;flu before boo&lt;/a&gt;,” an effort to encourage people to get their flu shots by Halloween.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001a3b6n4wvpchb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is still okay to get it later than that (you will still get protection),” Dupont wrote in the email. “But it is better to get it before the winter holidays to avoid spreading illness among your loved ones.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgny55cy00033b6nrmwlzxb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people may be able to access flu vaccines at their local pharmacy, doctors office or even through certain public health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo276k0000c3b6njhsvi9sg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for the first time, many people in the United States who want to protect themselves against the flu can order a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/health/first-us-home-flu-vaccine-launch-flumist-astrazeneca"&gt;nasal spray vaccine to give themselves at home&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo26brn000a3b6n81saf8g1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AstraZeneca’s FluMist, the only nasal spray flu vaccine in the US that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is now available for home delivery in 34 states under the brand name FluMist Home. It can be self-administered by adults under 50 and to children as young as 2 with the help of a parent or caregiver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo2byol000k3b6nacuqm10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            FluMist has been on the market for more than two decades, receiving initial FDA approval in 2003. In September 2024, the FDA gave the green light for the nasal spray vaccine to be self-administered, but it wasn’t ready to reach the public in time for last respiratory virus season. However, the product is available for this season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001b3b6nnf3qoyp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eligible patients, the flu shot should be covered by almost all insurance programs, but without insurance, “a flu shot at a retail pharmacy may be as low as $30 for a regular dose and up to $130 for a high dose (which is recommended for those over 65),” Dupont said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgo1ryg600003b6nov98dipd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The at-home nasal spray flu vaccine option is covered by most commercial insurance, with an $8.99 fee for shipping and handling. The online ordering platform includes a brief medical screening questionnaire to be reviewed by a licensed health-care provider before prescribing the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001d3b6ntweso055@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RSV vaccines are recommended for adults 75 and older as well as those ages 50 to 74 who are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of severe illness&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. It’s estimated that one dose of RSV vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;provides protection against disease&lt;/a&gt; in older adults for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001g3b6n578e71vr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, to protect infants from severe RSV, immunizations can be given to mothers during pregnancy or to babies after birth as an antibody shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001h3b6nizgg8atc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re someone who is pregnant, between 32 and 36 weeks, consider getting it – because when you get that RSV vaccine, you’re going to pass those antibodies to your newborn, and they’ll be protected,” Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001e3b6nx02zzjhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The RSV vaccine is available for eligible adults at any time, but the best time to get it is typically late summer and early fall, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/media/images/2025/08/RSV-vaccine-chart-3272025_lc_08.15.2025_edit.png" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001i3b6nxlugjwcb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For mothers, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/media/images/2025/08/RSV-vaccine-chart-3272025_lc_08.15.2025_edit.png" target="_blank"&gt;RSV vaccine is usually available&lt;/a&gt; from September through January, according to the CDC. For infants, the antibody shot is typically recommended from October through March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001j3b6nze2l3ar7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They should start getting it now,” Dupont said. “It is just a one time shot currently.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001k3b6n5m3zsx5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eligible people with insurance, the RSV vaccine may be covered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001l3b6nvt6ko97s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without insurance, “an RSV vaccine may cost $350,” Dupont said. “But there are patient assistance programs that can significantly lower the price if you are paying out of pocket.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001n3b6nwz25jooc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Outside of respiratory viruses, other seasonal vaccines may help reduce the risk of getting sick this fall and winter, Galiatsatos said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001o3b6nrznzx1xv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial pneumococcal infections – including pneumonia – in older adults, infants and certain younger adults with underlying health conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001q3b6nnicozwq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In addition to vaccination, people should stay home when they’re sick to avoid spreading diseases, and if people want to protect themselves further, then they can avoid crowded indoor locations during the wintertime,” Barouch said. “People also always have the option to wear a mask if they wish to do so, both to protect themselves and to protect others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001r3b6nzsr749x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu, Covid-19 and RSV can spread through respiratory droplets, Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001s3b6n9dh66ye3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good hand hygiene – so frequent handwashing and hand sanitizing – is really important because if somebody might have sneezed and then touched a door handle or touched that carton of milk that you were going to grab, as gross as it sounds, that’s how illnesses can spread,” Ren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgl96ro7001t3b6nc9jeno5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to cover your mouth when you cough, “get plenty of sleep, eat colorful fruits and vegetables and/or consider a multivitamin to keep your immune system up,” Dupont said.

The benefits lasted at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clearing-brain-waste-dramatically-improves-memory-in-aging-mice"&gt;Clearing Brain Waste Dramatically Improves Memory in Aging Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These preclinical results don't guarantee success in humans, but they're an encouraging start, which the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; "heralds a new era" in drug research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The therapeutic implications are profound," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; the international team of researchers, co-led by scientists at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and the West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176794" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-642x361.jpg" alt="BBB IBEC" class="size-medium wp-image-176794" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-738x415.jpg 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Imagen-horizontal-3-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176794" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Amyloid-beta plaques (red) were cleared from the brains of treated mice (left) but not untreated controls (right).

It also keeps out much of our medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, drug researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;have tried&lt;/a&gt; to use nanoscopic packages, called nanoparticles, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;smuggle&lt;/a&gt; Alzheimer's drugs across the blood-brain barrier.

Their ultimate target is 'endothelial LRP1', which helps remove amyloid-beta plaques at the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature," &lt;a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/consiguen-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-ratones-con-el-uso-de-nanoparticulas"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; bioengineer Giuseppe Battaglia from IBEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta  accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing amyloid-beta and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease are proving tricky to find. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;latest drugs&lt;/a&gt;, which target abnormal clumps and tangles in the brain, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;produced mixed results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While drugs like lecanemab and donanemab can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-lifes-purpose-could-be-keeping-dementia-at-bay-study-finds"&gt;somewhat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sciencealert.com/this-fda-approved-drug-slows-down-alzheimers-we-finally-know-why"&gt;slow down&lt;/a&gt; Alzheimer's symptoms, they can't reverse the disease or stop its progression, no matter how scientists try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-says-expert"&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a rut. They argue we've been too focused on clearing plaques and tangles inside the brain, when Alzheimer's may actually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-start-at-the-brains-borders-scientists-discover"&gt;start at the brain's borders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the current study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's too early to say if this strategy will work in people. Mice don't have the same brain vasculature as humans, and the current study only examined a very specific subtype of dementia in a small number of rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dudley says the results add to growing evidence that "repairing the blood-brain barrier itself could offer a new way to treat Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This type of research – while still early – is crucial for taking us closer to finding a cure," she &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-amyloid-%CE%B2-clearance-in-a-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) — A person living in New York has tested positive for the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-mosquitoes-chikungunya-explainer-050e53750c8c041fc72b7cf62c01b92f"&gt;chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in what state health officials say is the first reported transmission of the mosquito-borne illness within the United States in six years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health said Tuesday that the virus, which has been &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-chikungunya-virus-outbreak-control-measures-3ee97c21152b05ed0912af646594eafd"&gt;spreading in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and elsewhere, was identified in a person living in Nassau County on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county’s health department, in a separate statement, said the person began experiencing symptoms in August after having traveled outside of the region, but not out of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how exactly the person, whom authorities have not named, contracted the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the person was likely bit by an infected mosquito, but they also say the virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and there is no evidence of ongoing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The type of mosquito known to carry chikungunya is present in parts of the New York City metropolitan area, including suburban Long Island. The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mosquitoes are less active during the fall’s cooler temperatures, the current risk of transmission is “very low,” said state Health Commissioner James McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, according to the state health department. Its symptoms include fever and joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling and rashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is rarely fatal and most patients recover within a week, though newborns, older adults and people with chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are at higher risk, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and its territories have not seen a locally acquired case of the virus since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state has had three other cases of the virus this year, though all were linked to international travel to regions where the virus is prevalent, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local mosquitoes can transmit other dangerous viruses, such as West Nile, Eastern Equine Encephalitis and Jamestown Canyon viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student found the duck earlier in the week, according to the Hawaii Department of Health. Laboratory testing confirmed the duck carried the H5 subtype of influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of avian influenza, or H5N1, is pending from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa, in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, officials said, the risk of infection to humans is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human infections remain rare and are primarily linked to direct animal exposure,” said health officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/avian-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; has been circulating worldwide, and is highly infectious among wild birds and poultry, with outbreaks on the U.S. continent affecting hundreds of dairy cattle herds in 18 states, including California.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, so far, has been limited in Hawaii, which has had no human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s first outbreak of avian influenza was &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3V1duhd" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed at Susie’s duck sanctuary &lt;/a&gt;in Wahiawa last November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Biosecurity confirmed that at least 10 birds on the property, including ducks, geese, and a wild zebra dove, died from avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 waterfowl, including some ducks adopted by a family at Pearl Harbor, either died or were euthanized in relation to that outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, officials also confirmed avian influenza in a &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3WCxRBP" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;wild duck&lt;/a&gt; tested at James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge in Kahuku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That duck showed no signs of infection when tested, and was swabbed and released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during an ongoing project on genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, no new avian influenza detections had been reported in the Hawaiian islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH, DAB, and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources are monitoring health reports, poultry farms and wild bird populations for any signs the virus has spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student had reported the sick duck to the Hawaii Wildlife Center, a nonprofit that saves and rehabilitates wild birds, including seabirds disoriented by artificial lights during fallout season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout season began in mid-September and lasts through mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”As Hawaiʻi enters migratory bird season, this latest case is a reminder that wild birds may carry diseases to the islands and the public should remain vigilant,” said officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials remind anyone who encounters sick or dead birds to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Avoid touching or handling wild birds, especially waterfowl or shorebirds. Upon finding a wild bird, follow &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/4om9aFH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Report multiple or unusual illnesses in poultry, livestock, or other wild birds to the DAB Animal Industry Division at 808-483-7100, Monday to Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 808-837-8092 during non-business hours and holidays; or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:dabic@hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dabic@hawaii.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7887628/healthy-taco-recipes-30-minutes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;delicious taco nights&lt;/a&gt;, your routine is probably down pat—chop some veggies, grab the salsa, brown the ground beef, warm the tortillas and call everyone to the table. But as one recent study suggests, there’s a very easy swap you can make in that meal that could help you reach or maintain a healthy weight, according to a new study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just swap in a hearty scoop of seasoned beans for some of that meat. You’ll still enjoy the same tacos and the same full plate, but making that substitution may help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835958/habits-you-should-break-if-you-re-trying-to-lose-weight/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lose weight without needing to count your calories&lt;/a&gt;. In a six-week randomized trial, men who made that kind of trade—beans instead of part of their red and processed meat—lost more weight without cutting calories, and their LDL cholesterol improved too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s the takeaway for the rest of us: you don’t have to eat less to make progress. Tweaking what’s on the plate—more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich beans&lt;/a&gt;, a little less meat—can quietly move the needle on weight and heart health while dinner still tastes like dinner. Let’s break down this study, which was recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a six-week randomized controlled trial in Finland with 102 healthy men. Participants’ average age was 38. The were assigned to one of two diets:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Meat group: This group ate about 760 grams per week of red and processed meat. That’s roughly the average intake for Finnish men, and that meat supplied about 25% of their diet’s total protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume group: This group ate about 200 grams per week of red and processed meat, which is the amount aligned with a planetary health diet recommendation. They also ate legume-based foods that matched the protein from about 560 grams of red meat. So, in their diets, legumes accounted for 20% of their diet’s total protein, while red and processed meat made up 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apart from these provided study foods, participants kept eating their normal diets. Researchers collected food records and measured blood and urine markers at the start and end of the study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of six weeks, the legume group lost more weight (around 2 pounds) than the meat group (around 0.5 pounds), though participants weren't told to restrict calories. In fact, the legume group ate around 240 more calories per day. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/weight-loss-heart-health-study-11757537" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Body mass index&lt;/a&gt; (BMI) also decreased more in the legume group, but the difference may not be clinically significant. Total and LDL ("bad") cholesterol also fell more in the legume group than in the meat group, which makes sense since legumes offer more fiber and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, researchers found that the legume group’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-b12-than-beef-11776277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B12 intake&lt;/a&gt; and blood levels dipped but remained adequate. Iron intake actually increased overall for the bean group—though this form is less bioavailable than animal-based iron, leading to equal iron levels in both groups—while iodine status stayed the same between groups in the short term. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has its limitations. The trial was relatively short at only six weeks. It also included only men. Participants self-reported food intake, which can introduce errors. Also, those in the legume group reported exercising more, which likely affected the results. Although participants in the legume group lost around 1.5 pounds more—consisting of small reductions in fat and muscle mass—compared to the meat group, there were no significant differences in body composition between groups, suggesting the observed weight change may reflect transient factors like hydration or bowel contents. While the design allows stronger conclusions than observational studies, longer trials in more diverse groups would help confirm the benefits researchers observed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need a full dietary overhaul to see benefits—just make space for beans. Try these easy swaps a few times a week:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For tacos and taco salads&lt;/strong&gt;, use spiced black beans or lentils for half (or all) of the ground beef.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re grilling&lt;/strong&gt;, make a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7886300/chickpea-beef-burgers-with-whipped-feta/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;half-and-half burger&lt;/a&gt; with some mashed beans mixed into lean beef (or go for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046362/best-vegan-burgers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a hearty bean patty&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade your pasta&lt;/strong&gt; and stir white beans into marinara for extra protein and fiber. Top each bowl with a sprinkle of Parmesan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For simple meal prep&lt;/strong&gt;, build a grain-and-greens bowl with a big scoop of beans, crunchy veggies and a simple dressing. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-grain-bowl-with-feta-tomatoes-11742803" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Chickpea Grain Bowl with Feta &amp;amp; Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make beans the easy choice: stash a few cans in the pantry and cook a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8047812/how-to-cook-lentils/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pot of lentils&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend so they’re ready for you in the fridge all week. Beans play well with all kinds of big flavors, so let them bring out your culinary creativity. Add lemon and olive oil, a little garlic, herbs and maybe some spicy peppers. Bean-based dishes can quickly become something you look forward to each week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a six-week randomized trial, men who swapped part of their red and processed meat for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bean-based foods&lt;/a&gt; lost more weight and improved their cholesterol—without being told to eat fewer calories.

			&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, the world can sometimes feel like a dark place. Under the cover of darkness, negative thoughts have a way of drifting through your mind, and as you lie awake, staring at the ceiling, you might start craving guilty pleasures, like a cigarette or a carb-heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of evidence suggests the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00879-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;human mind functions differently&lt;/a&gt; if awake at nighttime. Past midnight, negative emotions tend to draw our attention more than positive ones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.10.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dangerous ideas grow&lt;/a&gt; in appeal, and inhibitions fall away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers think the human &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; is heavily involved in these critical changes in function, as they outline in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt; summarizing the evidence of how brain systems function differently after dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-are-5-profiles-of-sleep-heres-what-yours-says-about-your-health"&gt;There Are 5 Profiles of Sleep – Here's What Yours Says About Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hypothesis, called 'Mind After Midnight', suggests the human body and the human mind follow a natural 24-hour cycle of activity that influences our emotions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, at certain hours, our species is inclined to feel and act in certain ways. In the daytime, for instance, molecular levels and brain activity are tuned to wakefulness. But at night, our usual behavior is put to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg" alt="An alarm clock in the foreground with a blurred person in bed " class="size-full wp-image-141228" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our species is inclined to sleep at night. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADEbULOUn4/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, this, of course, makes sense. Humans are much more effective at hunting and gathering in the daylight, and while nighttime is great for rest, humans were once at greater risk of becoming the hunted at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, to cope with this increased risk, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened at night. Where it might once have helped us jump at invisible threats, this hyper-focus on the negative can then feed into an altered reward/motivation system, making a person particularly prone to risky behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add sleep loss to the equation, and this state of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="177488" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; only becomes more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are millions of people who are awake in the middle of the night, and there's fairly good evidence that their brain is not functioning as well as it does during the day," &lt;a href="https://mgriblog.org/2022/07/28/researchers-call-for-new-studies-to-learn-how-our-brains-change-when-were-awake-after-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Elizabeth Klerman from Harvard University in 2022 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My plea is for more research to look at that, because their health and safety, as well as that of others, is affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the hypothesis use two examples to illustrate their point. The first example is of a heroin user who successfully manages their cravings in the day but succumbs to their desires at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is of a college student struggling with insomnia, who begins to feel a sense of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair as the sleepless nights stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A person sitting at a desk while it's dark outside, looking tired and trying to study " class="size-full wp-image-141230" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;At night, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened.

Suicide and self-harm are very common at night. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/neurologic/neurology/nocturnal-wakefulness-and-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; reports a threefold higher risk of suicide between midnight and 6:00 am compared to any other time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 concluded that nocturnal wakefulness is a suicide risk factor, "possibly through misalignment of circadian rhythms."&lt;br&gt;

In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395920301134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; at a supervised drug consumption center in Brazil revealed a 4.7-fold greater risk of opioid overdose at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these behaviors could be explained by sleep debt or the cover that darkness offers, but there are probably nighttime neurological changes at play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers like Klerman and her colleagues think we need to investigate these factors further to make sure we are protecting those most at risk from nighttime wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the authors said no studies have examined how sleep deprivation and circadian timing impact a person's reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we don't really know how shift workers, such as pilots or doctors, are coping with their unusual sleep routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six hours or so a day, we know surprisingly little about how the human brain works. Whether asleep or awake, the mind after midnight is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Network Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many of us head to the dentist with good intentions, but some of the things we do (often without realizing it) actually end up slowing down or disrupting the care we’re there to get. We spoke with several dentists to find out which habits they’d love their patients to stop, and what to do instead, so your next checkup is easier and more comfortable for everyone.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Perhaps the most common slip-up at the dentist’s office is patients stretching the truth about their oral hygiene habits. “I notice that patients often exaggerate about how frequently they brush and floss,” says Whitney White, DDS/DMD, a dentist and practice owner at Aspen Dental. “We always ask about oral hygiene during routine visits, and I think some patients feel like they have to say they floss daily and brush twice a day—whether it’s true or not. But their gums usually tell the real story!” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White says many patients feel embarrassed to admit they’re not flossing or brushing as much as they should, but she emphasized that honesty with your dentist is always best. “We make it a priority to create a judgment-free space where patients feel comfortable being honest about their habits. The goal is always to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/tips-to-brush-your-teeth-better-11778280" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help them improve their oral health&lt;/a&gt;—not to make them feel bad about it.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@6813b928" data-item-index="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as any orthodontic treatment, honesty (again) is just as important as consistency. “I frequently encounter patients who don't share that they haven’t been diligent in wearing their aligners or following directions,” says Nayson Niaraki, DMD, MS, an orthodontist and the cofounder of Smilebar. “It makes it much harder to help them achieve their goal when they are not giving us the whole story. We are in this together! Helping us understand what is happening when you leave the office ultimately will help you, the patient, to achieve the smile you’ve always wanted.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@7b858c27" data-item-index="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the simplest ways to practice good dental etiquette is actually the most obvious: Respect everyone’s schedule. “Dental etiquette is really a win-win: It protects your health, saves you money in the long run, and allows your dentist to deliver their very best work,” says Catrise Austin, DDS, celebrity cosmetic dentist and the host of the Let’s Talk Smiles podcast. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make sure you arrive on time, and do not head to the bathroom right as the office is ready for you. “Dental schedules run on precision,” says Austin. “Running late without notice or delaying once called in disrupts care for everyone. A quick call ahead makes all the difference.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@38f5de63" data-item-index="3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-skipping-the-appointment-altogether"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Skipping the Appointment Altogether &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skipping a visit without notice is one habit dentists say impacts both patients and providers. “By far the number one thing is patients not showing up for their appointments without letting us know,” says Jenna Chimon, DDS, lead cosmetic dentist at Long Island Veneers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It might seem like no big deal to skip an appointment, but that time slot that was reserved for the no-show could have gone to someone else instead of leaving us with an empty chair.” She notes that while they understand that unexpected things come up, a simple call or text allows the office to adjust the schedule and offer the spot to another patient.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@6f4699ee" data-item-index="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another common misstep is showing up without an appointment and hoping to be squeezed in. “Dental care isn’t like grabbing a latte—our schedules are carefully structured around time-intensive procedures,” says Austin. “Every time a patient pops in unannounced, it can push back the whole day and compromise care.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Her advice: Always schedule ahead, and if you have a dental emergency, call first to see how they can fit you in safely. In true emergencies, most offices will make every effort to prioritize your care without disrupting the treatment of other patients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another habit that frustrates professionals is when patients talk on the phone during an appointment. “Imagine working with tiny instruments in someone’s mouth while they’re chatting on speakerphone—it’s stressful and unsafe,” says Austin. “Appointments are short; it’s best to silence your phone and use that time for your health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chimon points out that a smaller, though still noticeable, issue is when patients attempt to talk to her while she’s working in their mouth. “Instead, I always tell patients to give me a thumbs up if they need a break or feel uncomfortable.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@60c6033a" data-item-index="6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list-sc-item_7-0" class="comp list-sc-item mntl-block mntl-sc-list-item"&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-being-negative"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Being Negative &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One dentist shared that there’s one phrase they hear far too often at the start of an appointment: “I hate the dentist.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We understand dental fear, but leading with negativity sets the wrong tone,” says Austin. “Instead, share what [about the process] makes you anxious so we can help make your visit more comfortable.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, it’s one thing to have concerns about the cost of treatment, but turning that concern into a complaint, such as “this is way too expensive,” can make the discussion less productive. “High-quality dental care reflects advanced training, materials, and safety,” says Austin. “Instead of complaining about fees, ask about financing options or preventive care to lower future costs. Investing in your oral health is like investing in your smile’s retirement plan.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@74be1a58" data-item-index="7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, some patients treat the dental chair like a living room recliner and kick off their shoes. “It happens more than you’d think!” says Austin. “It’s unsanitary and makes the environment less professional for everyone. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/shoes-inside-house" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keep shoes on&lt;/a&gt; and remember: A dental chair is not a recliner—it’s a medical environment.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed a case of rat lungworm disease in an individual on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease, a parasitic disease also known as neuroangiostrongyliasis, is known to be endemic on all islands in Hawaii. The diagnosed individual had no history of travel to other islands, outside the state or country, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual sought medical care after experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness and aversion to bright light. The Hawaii State Laboratories Division confirmed the diagnosis of rat lungworm, using newly available sensitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials, however, have not been able to identify the exact source of infection for this individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/rat-lungworm-neuroangiostrongyliasis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rat lungworm disease&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a roundworm parasite called Angiostrongylus cantonensis, affects the brain and spinal cord and can result in long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite is only found in rodents, but infected rodents can pass larvae of the worm in their feces, which can then be ingested by snails, slugs, and some other animals such as freshwater shrimp or prawns, which then become intermediate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, DOH said, most people become ill by accidentally ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite, but can also become infected via an intermediate host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said that from Jan. 1, 2014, to the present, there have been 102 cases of rat lungworm disease reported statewide — 78 from Hawaii County, 13 from Maui County, seven from Honolulu County and four from Kauai County, including this latest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases, 84%, have been in Hawaii County, while the other 16% have been cases reported in visitors. The last case confirmed on Kauai was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said early diagnosis is important in order to target treatment, and to reduce the long-term effects associated with this disease. Prevention is also important statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thoroughly inspecting and washing all fresh fruits and vegetables under clean, running water is the most effective way to reduce the risk of rat lungworm disease,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, state epidemiologist, in a news release. “Small slugs and snails on produce can be difficult to see. Cooking food thoroughly also kills the parasite that causes rat lungworm disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH provides the following recommendations to prevent rat lungworm disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wash all fruits and vegetables under clean, running water to remove any tiny slugs or snails. Pay close attention to leafy greens. This is important whether produce comes from a local retailer, farmers market or backyard garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Control snail, slug and rat populations around homes, gardens and farms. Get rid of snails, slugs and rats safely by clearing debris where they might live. Consider using traps and baits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maintain water catchment systems and replace filters regularly. Cover and protect catchment tanks, as slugs can crawl up the tank and get into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6t002d3b79sgqrerqk@published"&gt;I’m a 46-year-old, bisexual woman who is 10 years older than my partner. I have a ton more experience and kinks than him.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs4qxu00313b790k8riv2r@published"&gt;I’ve had to let the kinks go because it’s not in his nature. He’s also small compared to previous partners. He doesn’t have a micro penis, but it’s below average. You could say I was a size queen, as I used to only look for partners on the large end of the spectrum before I met him. I was also non-monogamous for five years before him. I had girlfriends, boyfriends, threesomes, and moresomes. It’s been eight years, and there’s no kink, no women, only one threesome, and a small penis.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6u002e3b79bcif00ay@published"&gt;I’m sad about all of this all the time. The sex is OK, and he puts in so much effort, but I miss the feeling of a larger penis. I love to give oral (so does he), but it’s a bummer that I can’t even use my hands and mouth at the same time. I can’t give him the full experience. I don’t try to have threesomes because I’m embarrassed by his size, and he would not be OK if I dated other men. I plan to be with him for the rest of my life; he is the best person I’ve ever met. However, right now, it’s me and my magic wand against the world. I don’t want him to feel like I have to use it every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002f3b797bzw61pg@published"&gt;Is there hope for me? How can I stop thinking about other, bigger penises all the time? I’m somewhat OK without BDSM, but I need something. I also find myself craving a relationship with a woman. We don’t have sex very often, which might contribute to the whole situation. Lastly, I’m conventionally attractive and get flirted with all the time. That does not help. I wish I weren’t experienced and “freaky.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002i3b799t6skhc8@published"&gt;There’s plenty of hope in several different directions. Our ability to control our thoughts is pretty limited, and mostly relies on mindfulness or actively thinking about something we want to think about instead of trying to push away the thoughts we hope to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002j3b79u2mvxcax@published"&gt;With direct answers to your questions out of the way, I have to point out: You sound pretty miserable. If you simply needed a place to vent, I’m happy we could provide that, and encourage you to consider who you might be able to trust to be that place for you in the future. You’ll want a friend who doesn’t know your partner, or at least isn’t socializing with them extensively, and who is able and willing to hold these frustrations without sharing them around town.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002k3b793rmp8gf1@published"&gt;Are you attracted to your partner? Your letter contained an extensive list of ways his physical attributes turn you off, and then a statement about him being the best person you’ve ever met, so I’m left wondering whether there’s anything about him that does turn you on but that you didn’t include.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002l3b79frhkurs0@published"&gt;If you aren’t attracted to him at all, in the sexual sense, could that be contributing to the infrequency of the sex you have together? I’m also wondering whether your description of kink as “not in his nature” means that you’ve made an assumption, and whether there might be more wiggle room there than you think. Have you given him the chance to decide for himself whether he’s up for any of the aspects of BDSM that you’re missing? Reading between the lines a little, men who are respectful, solicitous, and follow their female partners’ leads outside the bedroom often make great male doms with a bit of encouragement and support. What we might see as a man’s “nature” lending itself to sexual dominance can sometimes be an alpha identity or a more explicit tendency to be abusive. Give that some thought.&lt;/p&gt;

If any of that resonates, spend some time with the friend I suggested you talk with up top, or with a sex-positive therapist, working toward a clearer understanding of what you actually need and want. It absolutely might be the case that you stick with your choice to forgo the extremely novel and varied sex life you used to have. Regardless, I think you’ll have an easier time living with your decision if you’re thorough about arriving at one.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I have one problem with him: His dick is GIGANTIC. It’s both a length problem and a girth issue—it’s nearly as thick around as a soda can. Penis-in-vagina sex is possible for us, but it takes a ton of foreplay and lube to make it happen. Much of the time, I don’t orgasm outside of non-penetrative sex because it feels like I’m being stretched to the breaking point. Is there some way I can loosen myself up so we can make this work physically?&lt;/p&gt;

First, foreplay is fantastic regardless. Ideally, this foreplay includes at least one adequate-to-great orgasm for you, as that tends to help with relaxing the vaginal canal. You also might try very slow penetration at first, or even entering without thrusting at all, to give your body time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6514003l3b79irakxu97@published"&gt;Speaking of time, you’ve only been having sex with this man for a few weeks, so your body might do some adjusting of its own over the next few months. And you can work on letting the muscles in your pelvic floor relax. Try breathing techniques that encourage physical relaxation, and visualizing your body opening, until you find something that works for you or get fed up with the process. But do give each practice more than a single cursory attempt. Most likely, you’ll need a combination of these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

I really do not want to do this.

I haven’t given my husband a definitive answer on whether we will resume, but I know he’s going to be crushed when I tell him this is a chapter in our lives that I want to remain closed.

Your kids are going to get older and require less minute-by-minute care. They’ll start going to school for large portions of every weekday and participating in activities that don’t require your supervision in their free time. In a decade and a half, they’ll probably be out of the home entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

If you go to your husband with explanations for your decision that are fairly easy to work around, he’s almost certainly going to have hope that you’ll change your mind when the kids are older or if he finds a way to throw the party elsewhere. If you’re done with orgies for other reasons, get clear on that before you broach the subject with your husband and be prepared to share &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; reasons—even if it’s simply that you’re done and aren’t sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

The updated recommendations, published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility, identify kiwis, rye bread, magnesium supplements, and probiotics as promising options for improving bowel regularity. These are the first evidence-based guidelines to focus on food-based management rather than medications. With constipation affecting around 16% of adults globally, experts say the new framework offers a long-overdue, science-backed approach to managing the condition naturally and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is chronic constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation is typically defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week, while chronic constipation refers to symptoms that persist for more than three months. It’s a widespread digestive issue that can cause hard stools, bloating, abdominal pain, and even nausea. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, constipation leads to around 2.5 million doctor visits in the U.S. annually. While anyone can experience it, the problem is especially common among women, older adults, and people with sedentary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts warn that chronic constipation can take a toll on both physical comfort and emotional well-being if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods and supplements that relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend several targeted dietary changes to relieve symptoms and improve bowel function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiwis&lt;/strong&gt;: Eating three kiwis a day — with or without the skin — can help increase stool frequency. Studies show that kiwis contain enzymes and fibers that support digestive movement, though they don’t significantly change stool consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rye bread&lt;/strong&gt;: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day may aid stool frequency, though this quantity might be difficult for some people to manage daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements&lt;/strong&gt;: A daily dose of 0.5–1.5 grams can enhance stool softness, reduce bloating, and improve overall comfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;keyword id="29506441" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fiber-supplements" source="keywords"&gt;Fiber supplements&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements such as psyllium per day can increase bowel regularity. The dosage should be introduced gradually to avoid gas and discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: Specific strains like Bifidobacterium lactis and Bacillus coagulans may help balance gut bacteria and ease symptoms when taken consistently for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High mineral-content water&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking 0.5–1.5 liters daily, especially water rich in magnesium, can complement other dietary treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why diet plays a crucial role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although traditional advice often centers on eating more fiber and drinking plenty of water, researchers say those recommendations are too broad and not always backed by solid evidence. Eirini Dimidi, lead author of the new guidelines and associate professor at King’s College London, explained that many existing strategies rely heavily on pharmaceuticals rather than nutrition. “We realised that the dietary recommendations available were limited and lacked robust research,” she said. The new review aims to fill that gap by identifying specific foods and supplements that have demonstrated consistent results in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A step toward better digestive health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimidi and her team hope these guidelines will help both healthcare providers and individuals make more informed choices. “We want people to feel empowered to take control of their symptoms using evidence-based dietary strategies,” she said. Chronic constipation can deeply affect daily life — from limiting physical activity to causing discomfort and stress. By embracing these new recommendations, individuals can explore natural, research-backed options to restore regularity and improve their overall digestive health.

However, for the one in three people who are considered "&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/motion-sickness/#frequency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highly susceptible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;highly susceptible&lt;/a&gt;" to &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/yoga-wellness/motion-sickness-remedies-for-travel" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:motion sickness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;motion sickness&lt;/a&gt;, that journey can be a nightmare. But don't give up on that trip just yet, because according to a new study, there's one kind of music that could cure motion sickness for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In September, researchers from China's Henan Institute of Science and Technology published the findings of their study in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1636109/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looking into music's effect on motion sickness and which types of music may help the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To reach its conclusion, the team collected electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which measures the brain's electrical activity, from 30 participants who took part in a simulated &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/fall-road-trips-around-the-us-11807758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:driving experience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;driving experience&lt;/a&gt;. When the participants were "driving," the researchers measured their brain activity and built a computer model to tell when they were experiencing motion sickness. Once that model reliably detected motion sickness, the team then tested different types of music to see which, if any, could help ease it. They tested four kinds, including music they deemed joyful, sad, stirring, or soft, and compared the effects to a control group that recovered from motion sickness without the help of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After examining the data, they found that both soft and joyful music had the best effects, with soft music reducing instances of motion sickness by 56.7 percent and joyful music by 57.3 percent. These were followed by passionate and sad music; however, the team noted that "the alleviation effect of sad music was lower than that of the control group," meaning you can skip those tear-jerking songs on your playlist. As for why, the team explained in a statement that it's possible "soft music relaxes people, relieving tension which exacerbates carsickness, while joyful music might distract people by activating brain reward systems." Sad music, on the other hand, might have the opposite effect, further amplifying negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side effects such as drowsiness," Dr Qizong Yue of Southwest University, China, and corresponding author of the article, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shared;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt;. "Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the team noted that their study does have some limitations, namely the small sample size and the fact that it was only carried out with a car simulation. Still, Yue explained, their findings do offer one easy &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/long-haul-flight-attendant-hacks-11745211" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:travel hack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;travel hack&lt;/a&gt; to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief," Yue added. "The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/music-to-help-motion-sickness-science-study-11813175" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Travel &amp;amp; Leisure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Travel &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNNHhiTWd6bHJSb042QUU2OGx0cUh5RG0tdjM5QkRtdVBnbmtiSVlJMFhLdklXaTlKRGR2WlNpbXpROHppWk9pZnlfLVRfbFk2QTlIY0hsMl9ybUp6RDNhTGNyd2F6M0d6UXd5VjRjN3dUczdPZVNUc3lSdlJqRWN4MFVLY1c5SXFXWWZRdTdiWQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
