    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cracking the window open in vehicles can also help to 'improve airflow and reduce airborne virus concentration'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Detwiler recommends keeping your hands away from your face as your eyes, nose, and mouth are direct entry points for pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Moving through TSA security&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TSA security checkpoints are one of the dirtiest areas in an airport, Dr Detwiler warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says: 'Much like old days when public pay phones were the most handled (and contaminated) surfaces, today those plastic security bins harbor more respiratory viruses than public toilets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the spread of germs, he recommends using hand sanitizer immediately after touching the security bins, conveyor belts, or fingerprint scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advises carrying a paper boarding pass or use mobile check-in to avoid using touch screen monitors, which harbor germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you want to take your safety protocols up a notch, Dr Detwiler adds: 'You could consider wearing disposable gloves, but remember to remove them safely and sanitize afterward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Darin Detwiler previously served as a public health expert for the FDA specializing in foodborne illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Navigating the terminal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With thousands of travelers from all over the world passing through each day, Dr Detwiler says terminals are high-risk areas for airborne illnesses like measles, flu, and RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, the health expert says wearing a facemask is a good idea, despite being out of the Covid pandemic era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends KN95 and N95 masks, as both are rated to filter out at least 95 percent of particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don't feel comfortable wearing it all the time, Dr Detwiler says it is essential to where masks in crowded areas if you want to maximize your safety,&lt;span&gt; 'particularly at security, near gate seating, and in restrooms'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other tips he offers to avoid germs is to maintain distance &lt;/span&gt;from anyone visibly ill (especially in boarding lines), to use your phone instead of self-check-in kiosks and shared touchscreens and to stay hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elaborating on his last tip, he explains: 'Dry air suppresses your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection, so it's best to keep a drink with you at all times.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Safely enjoying airport lounges &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Detwiler says premium airport lounges may offer a quieter atmosphere, but they're not immune to contamination, 'especially when it comes to shared food stations and high-touch surfaces'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, he advises avoiding self-serve buffets and opting for&lt;span&gt; packaged or made-to-order meals instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also recommends disinfecting tables and seating areas before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another area of airport lounges he says is riddled with germs is the washroom and shower facilities, so he always uses a napkin or paper towel to open bathroom doors and touch faucets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Boarding the flight and being on the plane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once you step onto a plane, you're in close quarters with hundreds of people for hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Detwiler says High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters used on planes remove 99.9 percent of airborne particles such as dust, bacteria, and viruses, the biggest risk is proximity to other passengers - especially if you're sitting close to someone coughing or sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former FDA employee who is also an ardent traveler, says when he flies he always picks a window seat as &lt;span&gt;you'll have fewer encounters with passing passengers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then always keeps his air vent open and directed slightly downward to 'create an airflow barrier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And before taking his seat, he uses sanitizing wipes to clean high touch areas, including the tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Dr Detwiler's biggest no-nos while flying is using the seatback pockets, because he says they are rarely disinfected and may harbor bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Arrival and post-flight precautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Think you're safe once you've landed? Think again, says Dr Detwiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that the baggage claim area, customs, and ground transportation all present new risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plus, he highlights that 'exhaustion can make you more vulnerable as you are less alert and it is easy to let your guard down'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep your health in check, he says the first step is sanitizing your hands after collecting your luggage, as your 'bag has been tossed around and handled by multiple people, moving along on conveyor belts, trolleys, and cargo holds'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then says it is best to keep your mask on in customs and baggage claim as these areas are still crowded with travelers from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On returning home or arriving at a hotel, the final step is to shower and change into clean clothes as soon as possible - especially after long-haul flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:33:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>North Texas pastor celebrates school's lowest vaccination rate in the state: 'We'll take it' - WFAA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxPcFh3bThxVkREbE8xUkxTc1FqbWtvbGhPTGl2dTRWeUtsZGh1bFJweHVXNHhWUUNoM1RVcHEyRllnS0ViYlpxQ0NsNnF2Q0F1T1gyQU15c0t4bEdLazB5TXpjVjExZ0p2V2ktRWF6Zm1vY2xWd2RiUlF0UktzMF9jUFlXc0xFeHoteXpIOVRwZ1ZycVlaU3JpN2toTHM5T1ZJYzg2NklaU0w1TFVrZW81OElvY0tSenpVVS1zSXNYeVRiMHJBM0kwam04aEV3RFdaQnlJZ29aUnlhLWFHTVphSDdwRV9nSy1DSktCeEo0Z1FXbFVFM1ZjME9aT2FENXJmaFVLRkw1dldXMGtHdlV5Q2w1Qk9nYlZFY0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, posted a video on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas — A Fort Worth pastor is celebrating his school's distinction as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the least-vaccinated school&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1I-g-xAPx/?igsh=MTJtaTdsemV1b2Nwcg%253D%253D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;posted a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; congratulating Mercy Culture Prep families "that embrace freedom of health."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not allowing the government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life," Schott said. "I know the entire world was shut down with insanity and people were fired from their jobs for forced vaccinations, and freedom is something we take seriously."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schott was posting the video in front of balloons and as he posed with a t-shirt that declared Mercy Culture Prep as the least-vaccinated school in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture Prep's vaccination rate -- which is required to be reported to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services -- drew attention last week amid heightened awareness over a measles outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFAA's previous reporting showed that Mercy Culture Prep had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in Texas, at 14.29%, among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas," Schott said in his video. "We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas – there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County) – public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed 11,745 adults over 14.5 years and found that those who used NSAIDs long-term had a 12% reduced dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, short- and intermediate-term NSAID use did not provide the same benefit, nor was the total cumulative dose linked to risk reduction. These findings suggest that sustained anti-inflammatory effects may play a role in protecting against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term NSAID Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Associated with a 12% lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Use:&lt;/strong&gt; No significant protective effect was observed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support inflammation’s role in dementia progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past research has suggested that inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of dementia and that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications may help protect against dementia due to their anti-inflammatory effects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108060"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12% reduced risk of developing dementia.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new large prospective study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt; provides additional evidence, showing that long-term NSAID use is linked to a decreased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the population-based study of 11,745 adults with an average follow-up of 14.5 years, 9,520 participants had used NSAIDs at any given time, and 2,091 participants developed dementia. Long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12% reduced risk of developing dementia. Short- and intermediate-term use did not provide benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the cumulative dose of NSAIDs was not associated with decreased dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that prolonged, rather than intensive, use of anti-inflammatory medications may help protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides evidence on possible preventive effects of anti-inflammatory medication against the dementia process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a need for more studies to further consolidate this evidence and possibly develop preventive strategies,” said corresponding author M.

Pictured with wife Jasmin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But the 35-year-old chef said he was repeatedly told it 'wasn't serious' and should pass 'in a week or so'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Robinson is urging others not to be put off seeking help for potential signs of colon cancer, amid an explosion in cases of the disease in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how the initial signs of his cancer were dismissed he said: ' I thought it was stress related, because it had come on rapidly while we were getting stuff ready for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were planning on a "princess wedding" but we were working very, very hard for it and I was working a minimum of 60 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It got really bad and I passed the most insane amount of blood so I phoned my GP and they told me to go to A&amp;amp;E straight away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I saw the doctor I mentioned to him that my great nan had died of colon cancer but he said there was no chance and that I was too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The wedding was so consuming and I was being told by every health professional that I definitely didn't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were saying "you're fine, don't worry, go and get married" so I took their word for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, after experiencing rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cbbd1ec0-fa88-11ef-a0ed-7d508a30f2b9" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; following his wedding, Mr Robinson was still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only after he suddenly passed 'an insane' amount of blood a month later in June that he rushed to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions.

I was told I had stage four colon cancer, which had spread to my liver. It was the worst news possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It absolutely crushed my wife. Aside from it happening to her, it was the worst possible news I ever could have had.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He immediately started immunotherapy, a treatment where medics use drugs to help the body's immune system identify and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Robinson said his medics were shocked when they found this had shrunk the tumour by 90 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even my oncologist was stunned, she was over the moon,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans revealed he had a tumour the size of an orange in his colon and he was diagnosed with stage four cancer — the most serious kind that means it's spread elsewhere in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he added: 'But if they'd found it in May then they might have been able to give me a treatment before it had spread to my liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back on his battle to get a diagnosis he said it was 'frustrating' to know more could have been done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was 34 at the time so I know when something's not right, you know your own body,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I rang the GP, I thought they would have made more of a thing of it but it just seemed like they didn't want to know.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Hertfordshire and West Essex Integrated Care Board, who oversee NHS GP services in the area, said: 'People are often the best judge of what's "normal" for their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-da6cf280-fa77-11ef-b956-698b44c9d439"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; advice is always to encourage anyone with worrying symptoms to seek advice and to ask again if they are still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are concerned or unhappy about the care they receive from their GP practice, we encourage them to first of all contact their practice's patient services team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they feel that the practice hasn't resolved their concerns, they can then get in touch with the integrated care board's patient experience team who will discuss the options open to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard of “mommy makeovers” — but now the menopause makeover is the latest trend shaking up the wellness industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.drsmita.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smita Ramanadham&lt;/a&gt; told The Post that her plastic surgery practice in New Jersey, once bustling with young women looking to bounce back after having children, is now seeing a fresh wave of middle-aged patients eager to address the aesthetic woes tied to “the change of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My only regret is not doing it sooner so that I can enjoy it longer,” said Jennie Rodriquez, one of Ramanadham’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after going under the knife. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The menopause effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most women begin the menopausal transition between the ages of 45 and 55, a process that may last several years, a period known as perimenopause. You officially reach menopause when you haven’t had a period for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings are typically associated with the transition, but menopause can also cause many bodily changes that affect your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said one of the most common complaints she hears from patients is weight gain due to hormonal fluctuations that change how fat is distributed in the body, particularly in the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of patients say they haven’t really changed their lifestyles in terms of diet or exercise, but it’s harder for that weight to come off compared to what worked for them in the past,” she said. “That leaves them feeling sort of frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham is also seeing more menopausal women seek out breast reductions after their busts grow larger during the transition, causing a wide range of problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s back pain, but it also starts to interfere with their lifestyles, especially if they’re more active, like runners,” she said. “A lot of patients say they have to double up on sports bras or that they can’t find a bra that fits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I saved for an entire year to do this … I knew [it] was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jennie Rodriquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Jennie’s journey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a total hysterectomy sent Rodriquez into menopause at just 38, she immediately noticed a change in her weight distribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For basically my whole life, I’ve been a smaller person,” she said. After having children, Rodriquez noted that she gained some weight, but a GLP-1 medication helped her shed 50 pounds in three months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I got down to what was the perfect size for me,” she said. “Then I got the hysterectomy, and I gained all the weight back and couldn’t lose it again on my own. Even when I went back to the medication, it didn’t work like it had before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham offers cosmetic surgeries and noninvasive treatments, like Botox. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Rodriquez found herself out of breath doing normal activities, like going for a walk, and struggled to fit into her clothes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was especially self-conscious about her stomach and knew she wanted a tummy tuck with liposuction to address her concerns — two procedures that Ramanadham said are staples of the menopause makeover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To afford the procedure, Rodriquez had to take on a second job. “I saved for an entire year to do this,” she said. “But it was something that I knew was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after undergoing the procedures. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reversing wrinkles,  under-eye bags,  saggy necks and droopy noses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menopause can also wreak havoc on your skin. “Collagen declines in our early 20s and 30s, but there’s more of that rapid decline in the perimenopausal period,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show women can lose up to 30% of collagen in the first five years after menopause, causing a loss of skin elasticity and firmness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We also lose water concentration, so our skin gets very dry as well,” Ramanadham noted. These changes often result in fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin, particularly around the eyes and neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the eyes, a significant drop in estrogen during menopause weakens the muscles on the upper lids, creating a hooded effect that can make you look tired and older. The withdrawal of estrogen also causes eye puffiness, where fat under the eyes moves forward, forming bags.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said surgical options like upper and lower eyelid lifts and brow lifts are common. For those wanting a less invasive approach, dermal fillers, Botox and platelet-rich plasma injections can promote collagen production, helping with under-eye bags, wrinkles and dark circles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Menopause can cause a significant drop in collagen, leading to wrinkles and sagging skin. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Alessandro Grandini – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As for the neck, a neck lift is the go-to solution for correcting sagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We remove the excess skin, address some of the underlying changes that happen, like with the muscles, and reposition the soft tissue and remaining skin,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to avoid going under the knife, Botox, microneedling and radio frequency skin tightening can also help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“None of these nonsurgical options are going to address the actual changes that occur structurally, but they can help soften the appearance,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drop in estrogen can even cause noticeable sagging in the soft tissues of the nose.  “Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy,” Ramanadham said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of stigma around plastic surgery. Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this, a traditional rhinoplasty, or nose job, can correct the sagging snout. But if you want to avoid surgery, a liquid rhinoplasty using dermal fillers can smooth out bumps, add volume or correct asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When to consider surgical solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The menopause transition typically lasts around seven years. While it’s a personal choice when to pursue cosmetic procedures, Ramanadham advises patients to wait until the changes in their body have stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, if you’ve gained weight and you’re actively trying to lose it, we don’t want to operate on a moving target,” she said. “I always tell my patients to get to a stable, happy baseline weight that they can maintain long term first.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, if you’re unhappy with your appearance, starting a conversation with a board-certified plastic surgeon is a good place to begin. “They can tell you if you’re a good candidate and if surgery can provide the goals that you’re looking for.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham is a double board-certified plastic surgeon in New Jersey &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shifting perceptions &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every woman goes through “the change” — so why is the menopause makeover trending today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham believes social media has played a large role in raising awareness about the cosmetic options available and reducing the stigma around them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there was still a lot of stigma around plastic surgery,” she said. “Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People are also living longer and want their outward appearance to reflect the youthful energy they feel on the inside. Ramanadham has patients in their 70s who, despite initial doubts, find that age isn’t necessarily a barrier to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We of course make sure all of your doctors are on board and you’re safe for surgery, but if you’re active and this will make you a better version of yourself, then let’s do it,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Rodriquez, now 43, the decision to get cosmetic surgery was a personal one that she has no regrets about — even if it took two or three weeks post-op before she could climb the stairs to her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We only have one life, and you should enjoy it to the fullest, ” she said. “Whether it’s something as major as surgery or as simple as Botox, anything that helps you feel better about yourself and stand a little taller at the end of the day is all that really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm"&gt;most common causes&lt;/a&gt; were infectious diseases — pneumonia, diphtheria, dysentery, measles, and other illnesses ran rampant through households, and children were especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cities, in particular, were “cauldrons of infection,” Samuel Preston, a demographer and co-author of the book &lt;em&gt;Fatal Years: Child Mortality in Late Nineteenth-Century America&lt;/em&gt;, told me. But around the country, communicable diseases were “rites of passage of childhood, some of them far worse than others, but all of them causing serious morbidity, and a lot of them causing death,” said Howard Markel, a historian of medicine who has studied epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today, by contrast, less than 1 percent of children die before the age of 5, and &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, once-common childhood diseases like measles were essentially unheard of in the US. What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Better sanitation and understanding of germ theory are part of the story, but one key factor that’s transformed American childhood over the past century is the widespread adoption of vaccines. Today, children in the US are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;routinely vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, some types of pneumonia and meningitis, and more. Other vaccines, including for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/typhoid.html"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, are in use around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This public health victory has saved hundreds of millions of lives and prevented billions of cases of disease. On a list of “the 10 greatest hits of medicine,” Markel said, at least nine would be vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That message has been getting lost lately, thanks to a &lt;a href="/policy-and-politics/2022/10/6/23389145/covid-19-anti-vaccine-legislation"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/technology/2023/9/16/23875579/facebook-meta-vaccine-covid-19-misinformation-study"&gt;anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/2023/6/22/23768539/rogan-rfk-hotez-debate-vaccine-deniers-better"&gt;sentiment&lt;/a&gt; around the US and the world, exemplified most recently by the &lt;a href="/politics/399801/w"&gt;confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;. one of the country’s most prominent vaccine skeptics, as the secretary of Health and Human Services. Just weeks into Kennedy’s tenure, a &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; has sickened more than 100 people and killed an unvaccinated child in Texas, the first death from measles in the US in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyderx4v8go"&gt;nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this time of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;falling vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; and rising risks of preventable disease, I wanted to flash back to the long period of human history before vaccines were available. Childhood in the centuries before vaccination was marked by illness, yes, but also by grief and loss in a way that we tend to forget now that disease outbreaks are more of a rarity. Understanding that can teach us about the consequences, for families and society, of the choices we make today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-sickness-and-death-were-the-norm" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When sickness and death were the norm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the years before vaccines, the prevalence of illness meant untimely death touched nearly every family. “Most parents as late as 1900 could expect to lose at least one child to disease,” Steven Mintz, a history professor at UT Austin who has studied childhood, told me in an email. That meant most children could expect to lose at least one sibling — sometimes more, given the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4847a1.htm"&gt;large families&lt;/a&gt; of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;James Marten, a historian who has studied childhood, recalls a gravestone with three names on it in his family’s local cemetery: “They were my grandfather’s sisters and brothers that all died within a week or two of each other,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a misconception that larger family size and the near-inevitability of childhood disease made the loss of a child less devastating for those who survived. In fact, “parents suffered extraordinary grief” when children died, Mintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After the death of her son Willie from typhoid fever in 1862, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/teachers/historyonline/usdeath1.cfm"&gt;Mary Todd Lincoln wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a letter, “My question to myself is, ‘can life be endured?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nor were children spared this grief. They might join in mourning — a &lt;a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Story-Memory-and-Mourning-Death-in-the-Gilded-Age#:~:text=The%20recommended%20length%20of%20time,the%20service%2C%20were%20also%20common."&gt;late-19th century photograph&lt;/a&gt; of heir Helen Frick as a young girl shows her wearing a locket containing a picture of her dead sister. They might also encounter constant reminders of their loss in the form of a new brother or sister with the deceased sibling’s name — a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00277738.2018.1536186"&gt;common practice in a time of high infant mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Though sickness struck people from all walks of life, poor children and children of color faced additional risks. New sanitation infrastructure like sewers, that limited the spread of disease, were installed in wealthy, white neighborhoods first, leaving poorer families vulnerable, said Nancy Tomes, a history professor at Stony Brook University who has studied the history of disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/30/us/native-american-boarding-schools.html"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of Native American children&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, were sent to boarding schools, often by force, where poor sanitation led to &lt;a href="https://exhibits.library.gsu.edu/health-is-a-human-right/displacement/american-indian-boarding-schools/"&gt;frequent disease outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/indian-boarding-schools-deaths-investigation-82645234fe9d7ce689e8375a51d7e161"&gt;a staggering number of deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Death and serious illness are staples of literature for and about children in the 19th century, often inspired by real-life loss. The illness and death of Beth, from complications of scarlet fever contracted from a baby, in Louisa May Alcott’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt; mirror Alcott’s own sister’s death in 1858, writes &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/fever-dreams"&gt;pediatrician Perri Klass&lt;/a&gt;. Laura Ingalls Wilder’s older sister Mary went blind in 1879 (when Laura was 12 and Mary was 14), likely from meningoencephalitis, an episode that shows up in Wilder’s book &lt;em&gt;By the Shores of Silver Lake&lt;/em&gt;: “the fever had settled in Mary’s eyes, and Mary was blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many infectious diseases disproportionately affected children, adults died too, and in the 19th century, as many as half of all children could expect to lose a parent by the age of 21, Mintz said. “The psychological toll was enormous.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There was also an economic and practical toll. Widowed mothers and their children, unable to support themselves, often had to enter almshouses or poorhouses in the 19th century, Tomes said. If a mother died, the father might send the children to live with relatives, or to an orphanage, which were “packed in this time,” Tomes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For those who got sick, meanwhile, the experience of disease itself could be painful and terrifying. Diphtheria, for example, causes a thick membrane to form at the back of the throat, making it very difficult to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The disease was called “the strangling angel,” Mintz said. If children made it through the first phase, they might die six weeks later of heart failure, Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even the survivors of infectious diseases could face lifelong effects. Polio, for example, could lead to paralysis, and some children spent weeks, months, or even years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/iron-lung"&gt;encased in an iron lung&lt;/a&gt; to help them breathe. (One of the last users of an iron lung, Paul Alexander, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238251518/iron-lung-polio-paul-alexander"&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt; after over 70 years with the device.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Devastating though they could be, endemic diseases like measles became expected in the years before widespread vaccination: “it was a fact of childhood life that you were going to get sick with one of these,” Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Polio, which arrived in the US &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/history/polio/timeline"&gt;in the late 19th century&lt;/a&gt; and led to more isolated, unpredictable outbreaks, caused more fear, Markel said. Parents kept children out of school, swimming pools, and movie theaters. “It very much shapes your daily life and what you do entirely once people learn about these things,” Merle Eisenberg, a history professor at Oklahoma State University who studies pandemics, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The polio vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination"&gt;introduced in 1955&lt;/a&gt;, put an end to those fears. Today, it’s one of a series of vaccinations that, together, allow most children in wealthy countries to grow up free from the infectious diseases that sickened and killed so many of their forebears. “We take it for granted the opportunities and the possibilities that children now have,” Eisenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These diseases aren’t gone, however. In higher-poverty countries where vaccine distribution is more of a challenge, preventable diseases still claim children’s lives, Rashida Ferrand, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine, told me. Cases of diphtheria are &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/navigating-diphtheria-resurgence-in-pakistans-conflictridden-and-disasterprone-area/759D1AF0BBBE6D8F3DA1949C9A3C28AA"&gt;on the rise in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, and polio remains endemic there and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1"&gt;in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the Texas measles outbreak shows, the diseases that devastated families for centuries can come back here too. And remembering the history of childhood before vaccines is especially critical now, experts say — a time when vaccination is being widely questioned, and the rampant disease and grief of the last several millennia of human history have faded from public memory (Covid pandemic notwithstanding).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s a past that we have largely forgotten, and it is so wretched a prospect, we should have it in mind as a possibility if we go down this road,” Preston said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This year’s flu season has been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/01/flu-season-children-hospitalized/"&gt;especially devastating for children&lt;/a&gt;, but doctors say vaccination can help protect kids from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/magazine/8-kids-on-what-they-saved-from-the-la-fires.html"&gt;The New York Times asked&lt;/a&gt;

The experiment involved mice born to live fast and die young, bred with a rodent version of progeria, a condition that causes premature aging. Left alone, the animals grow gray and frail and then die about seven months later, compared to a lifespan of about two years for typical lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GRFZJJCM6ZB3DFJ2CKHJZOBMYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Salk scientists had a plan to change the aging animals’ fate. They injected them with a virus carrying four genes that can reshape DNA and, in effect, make every cell in the rodents’ bodies young again. The scientists could even control the genes from outside the mice, turning them on and off to manage the safety and potency of the genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7BQEM6OFJA63IWBLGWABETVM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The experiment worked: The animals lived 30 percent longer afterward, a marked improvement, if not quite a normal mouse lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXADPNXNC5EYFM74XT2YR7HODE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And, with that, the longevity gold rush entered a new era. Tech titans and venture capitalists started throwing billions of dollars at labs exploring the technique, called cellular reprogramming. Experiments began on other mice, as well as worms and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57WCQ4FOYRFNLBO7GFBBAL53HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cellular reprogramming is now hailed by its supporters as&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most promising scientific approach to improving human healthspans and lifespans. Proponents claim it has the potential to reshape how — and whether — we grow old. And later this year,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a biotech company called Life Biosciences expects to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration to get approval for the first human trial of a version of the technique, according to Sharon Rosenzweig-Lipson, the company’s chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7L6IMPREVFGDI4XMF2THF3V7I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there have been serious side effects during some of the animal experiments,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;including gruesome tumors and even deaths. Some researchers worry the science is moving too fast, and basic questions about cellular reprogramming’s safety and effects for people and society still need to be addressed. What are the long-term health consequences? Who will benefit most: wealthy donors or anyone who’s aging or chronically ill? How much will it cost? And how far are humans willing to go for the possibility of more life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JDN5CA44ZVF3NCV5AQCPBW54FQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Honestly,” said Lucy Xu, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School who’s studied reprogramming in mice, “those questions keep me awake at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PJKIQTOE6RE7PCZDATLLHLIJKU" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PJKIQTOE6RE7PCZDATLLHLIJKU"&gt;Reversing aging in our cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6CTY6R3ZVBJRDBWTAYCLSVFJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’ve never heard of cellular reprogramming, you’re hardly alone. A relatively new field, it began with the jaw-dropping 2006 revelation that just four genes could return even the oldest, most decrepit cell to a state resembling youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M7OP5JB46BDNFGKTKZYIOHYCOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those genes and their effects were discovered by the Japanese scientist, Shinya Yamanaka, who won the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2012/yamanaka/facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 for his work and had the genes named after him. They became known as Yamanaka factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I5NXYNAMJJDENFIWOUYSG32AJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When introduced into a cell, the Yamanaka factors rapidly strip it of the outer layer of its DNA, known as the epigenome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAUGBNZZRJH2VEMLQISGZQ62QA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our epigenome is the key to cellular reprogramming and also, frankly, life itself. If you’ve ever wondered how the cells in your heart know to be heart cells and not skin, bowel or some other cells, you can thank your epigenome. It’s what gives every cell its identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D76UMGCTLZHSDEZE42RILGR35Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our DNA starts out alike in almost every cell. But almost immediately, tiny clumps of molecules known as methyl groups start attaching themselves like mollusks to the outside of various genes, with different configurations in different cells. Depending on the number and patterns of these molecules, the genes beneath will be able to receive biochemical signals telling them to turn on, or they won’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CW3KDYEC5DNTK5NVVD4OGJKOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This process, called methylation, is probably the most important part of our epigenome. Methylation continues throughout our lives and reflects those lives, for better and worse. Smoking strongly influences methylation patterns. So does exercise, although in almost opposite fashion. Ditto for stress, nutrition, parenting, illness, air pollution and many other choices and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LWGSR5AE6JGQLNHCHEBKWCKHKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Through methylation, our epigenome functions, in effect, as our bodies’ diary, with the tiny molecular doodles on our DNA recording what we’ve been doing with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IOXBKLEO5FE4HGWAK2SQ3W6CZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But nothing affects methylation as much as aging. The patterns of methylation during infancy are distinctly different than during childhood, adulthood and old age. Many longevity researchers believe these changes in methylation don’t just record our aging process, they drive it, meaning our evolving epigenome may be responsible for aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6NMF72GWBJGXFJ4NPYHTN56L5Q" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="6NMF72GWBJGXFJ4NPYHTN56L5Q"&gt;Rapidly growing monster tumors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I7ZOWOB6QFCJ7N3SDEYLISNAPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In petri dishes, cellular reprogramming works just as expected. Add the Yamanaka factors to skin cells from a wrinkled centenarian — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22056670/" target="_blank"&gt;as scientists have done&lt;/a&gt; — and many of the cells will shed their methyl marks and turn back into newborn cells, or what scientists call pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XYPTMB434BBXNBZCC5OHMZ7R2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With no cellular memory of having been skin, these cells can become almost any type of cell, with the right coaxing. Pluripotent stem cells from donated human cells are routinely used today for tissue engineering and other medical and research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFI3X4XR7JEBPBFN6HQKEJ2ZL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the process isn’t efficient or benign. In a dish containing millions of elderly cells, many will become youthful stem cells after exposure to Yamanaka factors. But many others won’t, for reasons that remain mysterious. Some resist the process. Some die. And some, almost invariably, transform into huge, rapidly dividing growths known as teratomas or monster tumors. These develop when a stem cell doesn’t know what to become and turns into the wrong kind of cell. With a teratoma, teeth cells can wind up growing in a pelvis or bone cells in an eyeball. Although rarely malignant, teratomas often swell to massive sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2JNOMZ7NGRDHTFIGQSW2VOGGWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers can eliminate teratomas in petri dishes easily enough. But in living creatures, the growths create real-life horror films. When Spanish researchers activated Yamanaka factors in healthy mice for an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12586" target="_blank"&gt;early cellular reprogramming experiment&lt;/a&gt;, many of the animals died within weeks, sprouting teratomas and other cancerous tumors all over their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCSWM4ZBKNDMRCFP6V645GNL5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’ll always have teratomas” during cellular reprogramming, said Paul Knoepfler, a professor at the University of California at Davis, who studies epigenetics, stem cells and cancer. “It’s part of the process.

(Sinclair retains equity.) In April 2023, the company &lt;a href="https://www.lifebiosciences.com/life-biosciences-presents-groundbreaking-data-at-arvo-demonstrating-restoration-of-visual-function-in-nonhuman-primates/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; at an ophthalmology conference that they had successfully used this version of partial cellular reprogramming in the eyes of monkeys with a type of optic nerve strokes. The company said the experiment restored aspects of the monkeys’ lost vision and altered some of the nerve cells’ epigenomes — meaning the cells resembled those of younger animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y7PWFX3GDRB5DCHPTMIEHZASQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was the first time partial reprogramming had been attempted in primates.

Optic nerve strokes are relatively uncommon in people, typically affecting about 6,000 adults a year, but can be debilitating. The loss of vision in the affected eye is sudden, often total and usually irreversible, although some eyes improve on their own. There is no treatment. (In a statement to The Post, the FDA declined to comment on any interactions with Life Biosciences.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JW6FUZ2TARG77F63PVZVTRNYPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If the FDA approves its application, the company will repeat the methods from the mouse and monkey experiments, Rosenzweig-Lipson said. Scientists will inject volunteers’ eyes with Yamanaka factors that can be turned off or on with the antibiotic doxycycline, Rosenzweig-Lipson said. The hope is that the cells in people’s damaged optic nerves will grow more youthful at an epigenetic level, and their vision will improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVSSMME3KVD4TNGKHU4XYCY724" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The company thinks its partial reprogramming won’t result in tumors, since its protocol omits the most carcinogenic of the Yamanaka factors, Rosenzweig-Lipson said.

At the Salk Institute, scientists had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00183-2" target="_blank"&gt;followed up&lt;/a&gt; their studies of progeric mice by creating mice that had extra copies of the four Yamanaka factors engineered onto their DNA that could be activated with doxycycline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFU55KNUK5GLPMZGKSMAKJVBJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After several months, most of the fully reprogrammed mice were dead. The partially reprogrammed rodents were still alive and didn’t experience any teratomas. And in the adult animals, their kidneys and skin were biologically “younger,” according to tests of their epigenomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX5H2XBD6RFRLK33C2N3XTRHAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;None of the animals lived longer than normal, which was the main point of the experiment.

(A company spokesperson for Altos&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;declined to comment about the current status of its research or the possibility of human experiments in the future.) They’ll focus on specific diseases related to aging, such as diabetes, arthritis, optic nerve stroke, glaucoma, dementia and others, not aging itself, since aging isn’t a disease, according to the FDA, and drugs and other therapies can’t be approved to treat it, although once approved, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/15/rapamycin-longevity-drug/" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; can be used off-label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3WMXOYP6VEJJPF7XHTAFI3AB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear, though, whether treating damaged eyes or sore knees will satisfy wealthy funders who’ve been pouring billions into the hunt for longer lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G7SZWUSWNRD5FHHXTENR7M72T4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, some researchers worry safety concerns remain insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGKGUJQVLVA5TOKGBDH22VDTWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t believe there can be reprogramming,” even partial reprogramming, in living people without serious side effects, said Charles Brenner, a diabetes and cancer researcher at City of Hope research center in Duarte, California, and frequent critic of reprogramming studies. “Reprogrammed cells divide rapidly.

&lt;p&gt;Advancements in &lt;strong&gt;3D bioprinting&lt;/strong&gt; have taken a bold new step: a team of researchers from &lt;strong&gt;China, Japan, and the United States&lt;/strong&gt; has successfully &lt;strong&gt;3D-printed&lt;/strong&gt; a fully functional &lt;strong&gt;penis&lt;/strong&gt; and implanted it into &lt;strong&gt;rabbits and pigs&lt;/strong&gt;, with promising results. This cutting-edge breakthrough in regenerative medicine could transform treatments for penile malformations, erectile dysfunction, and other sexual disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Engineering a Functional Organ with 3D Bioprinting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was led by scientists at the &lt;strong&gt;South China University of Technology&lt;/strong&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The study represents a collaborative effort between international researchers working in bioengineering, regenerative medicine, and tissue printing. This advancement builds on decades of research into the bio-printing of soft tissues for functional organ regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3D printing in medicine has already enabled the creation of customized prosthetics and the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/human-body-replace-itself-every-7-years/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77687" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;repair of human tissues&lt;/a&gt;. However, replicating an entire, complex organ like the penis marks a scientific milestone. The research team used an &lt;strong&gt;advanced bioprinting technique&lt;/strong&gt; to construct a penile model using hydrogel, a material that mimics human tissue and supports cell growth and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The printed model contained key components of a real penis, including the corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and tunica albuginea, all crucial for achieving erection and sexual function. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tunica albuginea&lt;/strong&gt;, in particular, plays a vital role in sustaining an erection, and the scientists successfully engineered a synthetic version of this tissue called &lt;strong&gt;artificial tunica albuginea (ATA)&lt;/strong&gt;, composed of polyvinyl alcohol, which mimics the natural tissue’s elasticity and structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overcoming the Biggest Challenge: Blood Flow&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The major hurdle in printing a &lt;strong&gt;functional penis&lt;/strong&gt; was recreating its vascular system, which enables rapid blood inflow and erection. Without proper blood circulation, the implant would be useless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To solve this, the scientists incorporated endothelial cells, the cells lining blood vessels, to form a network of functional blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vascularized tissue allowed the implant to receive adequate blood supply, leading to a functional erection. According to the study, “the erection of the penis returned to normal after suturing the ATA at the injured part, and the long-term prognosis was satisfactory.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This suggests that synthetic tissue can effectively &lt;strong&gt;replace natural penile function&lt;/strong&gt; and could be applied to human treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Successful Animal Trials: Erections and Reproduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test their innovation, the researchers implanted the 3D-printed penile structures into B&lt;strong&gt;ama miniature pigs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rabbits&lt;/strong&gt; suffering from penile malformations. The results showed that the animals not only regained erectile function but were observed &lt;strong&gt;mating&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reproducing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This success suggests that bio-printed organs could soon offer real solutions for human patients. Specifically, this technology could help treat conditions such as Peyronie’s disease, which affects five percent of men between &lt;strong&gt;40 and 70&lt;/strong&gt; and leads to painful, curved erections due to scar tissue buildup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3D Bioprinting: A Booming Frontier in Medicine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field of 3D bioprinting is advancing rapidly, with emerging technologies like &lt;strong&gt;xolography&lt;/strong&gt;, a light-based 3D printing method that enables the fabrication of living cellular structures. Scientists are now exploring ways to print entire organs such as kidneys, muscles, and blood vessels, potentially transforming transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The artificial tunica albuginea also holds broader medical potential, as its biomimetic design could be adapted to repair other load-bearing tissues, including blood vessels, intestines, corneas, bladders, tendons, and myocardium (heart tissue).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Future of Bioengineered Sexual Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough in 3D printing opens doors to a future where personalized, bioengineered implants could restore lost or impaired functions in millions of patients. But with such advancements come ethical and regulatory challenges, as well as the need for more research to guarantee safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, signals that the future of regenerative medicine is closer than ever. If human trials prove successful, &lt;strong&gt;3D-printed organs&lt;/strong&gt; could soon redefine the way we treat congenital disorders, traumatic injuries, and sexual dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For now, the success in rabbits and pigs is a thrilling glimpse into what could become a medical revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgIrfiyK4x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

The highly contagious norovirus is rampant in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Norovirus has torn through the United States this winter, peaking early in some parts of the country but taking hold in South Florida over the last few weeks. It arrives with cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dizziness and fatigue, symptoms that set in about 12 to 48 hours after exposure to viral particles. On average, one person with norovirus will infect two to seven others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s a tough illness to have to deal with,” said Dr. Maria Garcia, an emergency medicine physician at Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Garcia is seeing firsthand what &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=d3ff13c4&amp;amp;target=Noro_G2&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22North%20Miami,%20FL%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22d3ff13c4%22%7D" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Florida wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; over the most recent 21 days confirms: Norovirus concentration levels through the state are high. Federal surveillance data only shows reported outbreaks in Florida through the end of January. Florida, like most of the south, had higher levels than in previous years as of Jan. 31, according to the Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Among those who caught the virus is Leslie O’Shea, of Fort Lauderdale, who said she missed three days of work last week due to the symptoms. She even slept on the bathroom floor, feeling lightheaded and struggling to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“This was the sickest I have been in a long time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Similar experiences fill social media posts, with photos of people in bed declaring “I wouldn’t wish norovirus on my worst enemy” and “This virus is straight from the pits of hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Experts say the surge of cases is being driven by a new dominant strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a strain that had been around for decades. Lower population immunity to this new strain could explain this year’s harsh wave of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This new strain, the CDC said, is linked to cruise-ship outbreaks in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Indeed, South Florida’s proximity to cruise ports may be exacerbating the spread. According to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vessel-sanitation/cruise-ship-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Vessel Sanitation Program&lt;/a&gt;, nine voyages that have departed from or docked in Florida this year have&lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/11/cdc-tracks-another-norovirus-outbreak-on-florida-based-cruise-ship/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; resulted in outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; — seven were confirmed to be norovirus. Passengers exposed to norovirus often have overnight stays in Florida and travel through local airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;So, what to do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Medical experts want Floridians to know that hand sanitizer does not kill norovirus. You need to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Norovirus is also hard to kill on surfaces, where it can live for days to weeks. If someone in your household vomits in the bathroom, you need to clean every contaminated surface with a disinfectant (typically bleach). The virus also can spread through &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/12/21/norovirus-is-rampant-blame-oysters-cruise-ships-and-holiday-travel/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;contaminated food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh article start my-32"&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__content"&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--start"&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;Spend your days with Hayes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__subheadline"&gt;Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--finish"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 25" class="fXDgxBh__success-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M9.6 18.326L3.6 12.326L5.292 10.622L9.6 14.93L18.708 5.82205L20.4 7.52605L9.6 18.326ZM12 0.32605C10.4241 0.32605 8.86371 0.636439 7.4078 1.2395C5.95189 1.84255 4.62902 2.72647 3.51472 3.84077C1.26428 6.09121 0 9.14345 0 12.326C0 15.5086 1.26428 18.5609 3.51472 20.8113C4.62902 21.9256 5.95189 22.8095 7.4078 23.4126C8.86371 24.0157 10.4241 24.326 12 24.326C15.1826 24.326 18.2348 23.0618 20.4853 20.8113C22.7357 18.5609 24 15.5086 24 12.326C24 10.7502 23.6896 9.18976 23.0866 7.73385C22.4835 6.27794 21.5996 4.95507 20.4853 3.84077C19.371 2.72647 18.0481 1.84255 16.5922 1.2395C15.1363 0.636439 13.5759 0.32605 12 0.32605Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;You’re all signed up!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? &lt;strong&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/newsletters/" class="ui__button--call-to-action" data-tbtevent="link" data-tbtcategory="Newsletter Sign Up Form" data-tbtlabel='{"element":"All newsletters link"}'&gt;Explore all your options&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 19 19" class="fXDgxBh__link-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M18.2334 9.32605C18.2334 11.713 17.2852 14.0022 15.5974 15.69C13.9095 17.3778 11.6203 18.326 9.2334 18.326C8.0515 18.326 6.88118 18.0933 5.78925 17.641C4.69732 17.1887 3.70516 16.5257 2.86944 15.69C1.18161 14.0022 0.233398 11.713 0.233398 9.32605C0.233398 6.9391 1.18161 4.64992 2.86944 2.96209C4.55726 1.27426 6.84645 0.32605 9.2334 0.32605C10.4153 0.32605 11.5856 0.558842 12.6775 1.01113C13.7695 1.46343 14.7616 2.12636 15.5974 2.96209C16.4331 3.79782 17.096 4.78997 17.5483 5.8819C18.0006 6.97383 18.2334 8.14415 18.2334 9.32605ZM3.8334 10.226H11.0334L7.8834 13.376L9.1614 14.654L14.4894 9.32605L9.1614 3.99805L7.8834 5.27605L11.0334 8.42605H3.8334V10.226Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Hand washing is key after you use the bathroom and before you prepare food,” said Dr. Indulekha Gopal, medical director for infectious diseases at Broward Health North. “The main way it spreads is person to person and not washing your hands properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Here’s what else you need to know, according to medical experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=""&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It doesn’t take much of the virus to make someone sick. Only a small particle is needed to pass on the infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors recommend that adults and children stay hydrated with Pedialyte. “Pedialyte is less irritating to the stomach than Gatorade and people tolerate it better,” Gopal said. “Make sure to sip it frequently.” Dehydration can lead to other symptoms, like dizziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zofran or antinausea medications may be necessary to curb the vomiting and fluid loss and allow you to take a fever reducer. However, antidiarrheal medications can be tricky, said Garcia from Baptist Health South Florida. “Some bacterial infections present similar symptoms and antidiarrheal medications will worsen them. You need to discuss it with a healthcare provider,” she said. “My recommendation is to avoid them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can’t get norovirus from someone coughing or sneezing, so masking won’t help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Symptoms from norovirus usually last one to three days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can still spread norovirus for days after you’re feeling better. “If you are preparing food and had norovirus a few weeks ago, you may be still shedding, so adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols,” Gopal said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Most people get better after a few days. But not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“If you are dizzy, weak and the vomiting is out of control, you may have to seek medical attention,” Gopal said. “Dehydration can be problematic for young children, the elderly and anyone who is immunocompromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for norovirus, and while there isn’t currently a vaccine, drug manufacturer Moderna is working on one. Any norovirus vaccine would require an educated guess as to which strains would be likely to circulate in a given year, which is the same concept behind the annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Additionally, it is possible to get norovirus more than once in a season, Garcia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“If there are multiple strains around, you might have had the virus and created immunity to one strain and someone is around you with another strain and you get infected again,” she said. “That’s why washing your hands is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tampa Bay Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 10:11:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQM0JMdmxYaWJpNnFvX2t5a2tQWV9zdTRjQnRRQU9jbWhnWWlJN3JCQ0pueENqeVNiN1FUNG84R0xseTNKY2plVXNsVVVpaFJ1bjhfX3FROS1TQmRPUllnaG16SDRDS0NtNllKOEwxRF9VT1hzOEhHd1k4QW51MWZGUW5Vcl9Hc3VCanBCemRRd18xUEti</guid></item><item><title>6 Sources of Protein That Aren’t Meat - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9vcDl3aTg1S05ITXpLMjJNbjZBVEV0dXY1bVVLWm1HNU00bXZWamtrdXNjRjlQeHcwMGJiMXZxbWNBbE9WZlU3NFl1eFE5Q3NyZzVuWVczZ3B3T2I2TGlxdnhPRVBqMXd0elozTG1FTkF4V21DTWprZXl0TnZiUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have long known about &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/well/eat/red-meat-diabetes-study.html" title=""&gt;the downsides of red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt;. Eating them has been linked with increased risks of health issues like heart disease, some types of cancer and earlier death. And &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/well/eat/plant-based-diet-nuts-beans-grains.html" title=""&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that replacing those protein sources with nonmeat alternatives like legumes, nuts, whole grains and more can improve your health in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Such swaps can also be better for the environment — and your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You hear the argument that eating healthy is expensive,” said Sara Elnakib, a dietitian and public health expert at Rutgers University. But you can enjoy plant-based sources of protein like beans right out of the can or ready-to-eat whole grains heated in the microwave. “It can be really easy. That’s the point: Whatever way you can get them into your system, do that,” Dr. Elnakib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are six sources of protein that aren’t red or processed meat, and the reasons experts love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Beans, peas, lentils, peanuts — legumes are “affordable, nutritious and delicious,” said Julia Wolfson, an associate professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Federal guidelines &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/well/eat/protein-age.html" title=""&gt;recommend that most people&lt;/a&gt; ages 19 and older get 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day (though personal needs can vary).

After a period of smooth sailing, one day, seemingly out of the blue, you have achy knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You wake up in the morning and you suddenly feel old,” said Dr. Steve Hoffmann, a computational biology professor at the Leibniz Institute on Aging in Jena, Germany. “That’s sort of the takeaway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It turns out there may be a scientific basis for this experience. By analyzing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" title=""&gt;age-related markers&lt;/a&gt;, such as proteins and DNA tags in the bloodstream, some scientists are coming to understand that aging in adulthood is not a linear process, but perhaps one that jumps dramatically at certain points in one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what they’ve learned so far, and what it could ultimately mean for your health and life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-e0f5dac"&gt;What does ‘nonlinear aging’ look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have long suspected that aging may happen in bursts, but they only began using molecular signals to measure the pace of aging in the past decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;widely covered Stanford study&lt;/a&gt; published last year tracked several molecular changes associated with aging in blood samples gathered from 108 adults between age 25 and 75. By comparing samples from different subjects of different ages, it found that people seemed to age more rapidly around age 44, and again around 60. The clusters of changes in the first spike appeared to be mostly related to fat and alcohol metabolism, as well as muscle function, and the second spike mostly to immune dysfunction and muscle function. The first spike could help explain why people seem to have more trouble &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/well/alcohol-middle-age.html" title=""&gt;processing alcohol&lt;/a&gt; starting in their 40s, and why they become more prone to illness in their 60s, said Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics at Stanford Medicine and study coauthor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The flu “certainly is still around,” said &lt;a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/beth-thielen" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Beth Thielen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://med.umn.edu/bio/beth-thielen" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Beth Thielen&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be deceived by the changing weather, either. “I think we see quite a tail out into the spring, and people should be aware that flu circulates around the globe year-round,” Thielen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means there are still plenty of chances you could get sick. And if you are exposed, you might wonder how long it’ll take before the symptoms smack you (if they do at all). Below, medical experts share just how long it takes to come down with the flu after being exposed and what to do if you do get sick: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes one to four days to get sick with the flu after being exposed to the virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical flu incubation period, which is the time it takes from being exposed to a virus to coming down with symptoms, is “somewhere between one and four days,” Thielen said. “Maybe a peak around two days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly when you get sick does vary but “when you look at the collective data that is looking at household exposures, the mean time usually is around three days,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Elisabeth Marnik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist and contributor for Those Nerdy Girls, an online resource for factual health and science information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We list it as a range because there are sometimes exceptions. Some people get it faster, and for some reason, some people get it a little bit later. But I would say that two to three days would be the typical exposure window,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu spreads through respiratory droplets, which spray when someone coughs or sneezes, Thielen said. So if you are sick (or someone in your household is), it’s a good idea to wear a mask or stay entirely away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus also spreads through touch. “If somebody coughs or sneezes and then touches a surface like a light switch or a doorknob, they are leaving behind that flu virus on those surfaces that someone else can come along and pick up,” Thielen added. This makes proper hand washing important, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have flu symptoms (&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/flu-symptoms-winter-2025_l_678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="such as body aches, fever, fatigue and cough" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;such as body aches, fever, fatigue and cough&lt;/a&gt;) yet, you can still spread the illness. Folks who are infected can shed the virus roughly a day before having symptoms, Thielen said. If you know you’ve been exposed to the flu, consider wearing a mask when around others even if you don’t have any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people who are exposed to flu and are high-risk, talk to your doctor about preventative measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thielen, there are antiviral medications available for high-risk adults and children (generally kids under 5) that reduce the likelihood of developing a symptomatic flu infection after a flu exposure. The most well-known post-flu exposure medication is Tamiflu, which is also used as a flu treatment after someone has symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medications that decrease the likelihood of developing a symptomatic flu infection ― like Tamiflu, Xofluza, Relenza ― are really just meant for people in a high-risk group, Thielen noted. That includes children under 5, people over 65 and those with certain chronic conditions. If that’s you or your child, you can talk to your doctor about treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: miodrag ignjatovic via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;miodrag ignjatovic via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;You can test yourself for flu with at-home flu tests.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re not high-risk, there are other precautions you can take if you’ve been exposed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been around someone with the flu but aren’t at risk of severe disease or hospitalization, buy yourself an at-home flu antigen test, Marnik advised. At-home flu tests, which are much like at-home COVID tests, are available at stores like CVS and Walgreens, and on &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/iHealth-COVID-19-Authorized-Non-invasive-Discomfort/dp/B0D3T1X1FS/v_cOg29FV0mGIgwqc_oV29Q.9kUKBdGsOcgyRGJxLDmS3JNt3bwjg_-ofLGaKay7OkA&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;hvadid=692399481061&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9007325&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvqmt=b&amp;amp;hvrand=12487517396036258426&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-373328626744&amp;amp;hydadcr=21850_13401802&amp;amp;keywords=home+flu+tests&amp;amp;mcid=060d4a6743853d7caa31264d180d8b33&amp;amp;qid=1741106534&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;psc=1?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="B0D3T1X1FS" data-aps-asc-tag="thehuffingtop-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4,-1,-1,d,0,0,hp-fil-am=0,0:0,0,0,0" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sites like Amazon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/iHealth-COVID-19-Authorized-Non-invasive-Discomfort/dp/B0D3T1X1FS/v_cOg29FV0mGIgwqc_oV29Q.9kUKBdGsOcgyRGJxLDmS3JNt3bwjg_-ofLGaKay7OkA&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;hvadid=692399481061&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9007325&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvqmt=b&amp;amp;hvrand=12487517396036258426&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-373328626744&amp;amp;hydadcr=21850_13401802&amp;amp;keywords=home+flu+tests&amp;amp;mcid=060d4a6743853d7caa31264d180d8b33&amp;amp;qid=1741106534&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;psc=1?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;sites like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That way you have it on hand so that if you do get sick, you don’t have to go out and try to get one and spread the virus,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, monitor yourself to see if you come down with any &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/flu-symptoms-winter-2025_l_678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="common flu symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;common flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Feeling disbelieved when knowing that there is something very wrong with your body can have devastating and long-term consequences. One of the most obvious consequences is that you won't get the correct treatment and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keaf115"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted of over 3,000 people with autoimmune disease uncovered many extra long-lasting disadvantages when the misdiagnosis involved a mental health or psychosomatic label (often termed an "in your head" misdiagnosis by patients).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These often included feelings of shame, self-doubt and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="154194" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. For some, it extended to suicidal thoughts and even suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further consequence was that people had much lower trust in doctors. This distrust led to some people avoiding seeking further medical help, often for fear of being disbelieved again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concerning finding from our study was that these negative emotions and distrust often remained just as strong many years after feeling that a doctor had not believed their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological scars were deep and usually unhealed. Over 70 percent of people reporting a psychosomatic or mental misdiagnosis said that it still upset them. And over 80 percent said that it had damaged their self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our study participants, who had several autoimmune diseases, told her story that spoke for many: "One doctor told me I was making myself feel pain – I still can't forget those words. Telling me I'm doing it to myself has made me very anxious and depressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154210" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition.jpg" alt="Wrist bending beyond average levels so thumb touches forearm" class="wp-image-154210 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition.jpg 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154210" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Subtle signs of chronic conditions are often missed, like hypermobile joints in &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/"&gt;Elhers-Danlos syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (Pheelings Media/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'I still can't forget these words'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were not just anecdotal. Overall, we found depression levels were significantly higher and wellbeing levels lower in people who reported receiving mental health or psychosomatic misdiagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use this woman's testimony in the title of our study: "I still can't forget those words."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did it accurately reflect our findings, but it symbolizes our research team's ethos to give these often unheard patients a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hurt of misdiagnosis was compounded by having "nowhere to voice my anger" or distress. Some of the most moving stories were from people whose early symptoms of autoimmune disease, when they were still children, had been disbelieved by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in middle or older age, those words and feelings had remained with them for decades, often felt as strongly as the day that they were heard. As one of the patient partners in our research team described it, they lived the rest of their lives with "seared souls".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman with lupus told the interviewer that her doctor had told her at age 16 that she had "too many symptoms for it not to be hypochondria".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spoke very emotively and articulately about the damage caused to a developing sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has affected my mental health very negatively and I do think it's affected me in my like sense of self. It's not good for anyone at any age but as a teenage girl being told you don't know your own feelings is absolutely no way to shape a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is natural when hearing all these very difficult stories, and seeing the damage caused, to blame doctors, but is that fair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors very rarely set out to cause harm. Rather, in some cases, it is impossible to diagnose autoimmune diseases quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our study highlights that some doctors do reach too quickly for a psychosomatic or mental health explanation for autoimmune disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research that may have influenced doctors in giving psychosomatic misdiagnoses says that a long list of symptoms is a red flag that the symptoms are not caused by a disease. This generalization rather dangerously fails to account for the fact that a long list of symptoms is also a red flag for many autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many autoimmune symptoms are also invisible, and there are no clear tests that will show how bad they are to the doctor. Some of the terms that patients find upsetting and dismissive when doctors talk or write about their symptoms include "vague" and "non-specific".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors often write letters quickly due to health service constraints, sometimes unthinkingly using terms passed down from their seniors; letters that use terms like "patient claims" or "no objective evidence found of" can increase feelings of being disbelieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Empathetic listening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research suggests that more doctors need to think about autoimmunity as a diagnosis early on when faced with multiple varied symptoms that often don't seem to fit together. Above all, many diagnostic clues can be found by listening to and believing the people experiencing the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathetic listening and support are also required to help misdiagnosed patients heal emotionally – they very rarely can just "move on" as one doctor advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not underestimate the power of doctors saying "I believe you" to patients with multiple invisible symptoms, and "I am sorry for what has happened in the past" if they had a difficult road to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 50 doctors interviewed for the study reported that misdiagnoses were common in autoimmunity, but few had realized that the repercussions of these misdiagnoses were so severe and long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassuringly, almost all of them were saddened and motivated to improve their patients' experiences. Several explained that they thought they were being reassuring by telling patients that their symptoms were most likely to be psychological or stress-related and thought this would be preferable to patients worrying about having a disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many people experience mental health and psychosomatic symptoms, and doctors must consider them as a possible explanation, a clear lesson from our study is that psychosomatic (mis)diagnoses are rarely seen as reassuring to patients with autoimmune disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they are usually deeply damaging with lifelong and life-changing repercussions.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250953/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mendy Pellin opened with his personal journey about Ulcerative Colitis, sharing hilarious anecdotes that lightened the mood and helped everyone feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to 5% of adult patients, and more than a few pediatric patients seen at ODA with some form of IBD, Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt;, beloved community doctor, emphasized that people can live full, happy lives despite their medical diagnoses. Dr. Rosen shared how maintaining a positive and uplifted attitude, believing “tracht gut vet zein gut” is not just a sweet sentiment, but actually affects the way we live and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;David Hudesman&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading Gastroenterologist and director of NYU’s IBD center, provided a thorough review of the condition; what factors contribute to its development; and the multitude of treatment options. He conveyed a sense of optimism, underscoring how manageable IBD can be, and prioritizing a great quality of life for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Laurie Keefer&lt;/strong&gt;, a Gastro-Psychologist and director for Psychobehavioral Research at Mount Sinai addressed the mental and emotional impact of living with IBD. A trailblazer in her field, she highlighted how critical and impactful appropriate support can be, and offered practical solutions and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Q&amp;amp;A that followed, attendees had the opportunity to anonymously ask their questions to specific doctors, covering a range of topics including medications, diet, mental health, and new, emerging research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One attendee noted that in the 40 years they’ve been living with IBD, the only support group available was when she arranged a group of 5 women from other communities who responded to her advertisements seeking peer support around this. To see tens of community members now gathered to learn more and be there for each other, was in itself already healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent mentioned how she thought her son was the only child in the community with Crohn’s. Now, after meeting several other parents, she feels more confident in her ability to help him manage his symptoms and maintain a normal, healthy childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was intended to introduce the community to a new initiative, the Crown Heights Crohn’s and Colitis Support. The CHCCS was recently formed as it recognized the need for social support, and to destigmatize the condition. The CHCCS currently has a WhatsApp group for patients with Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis, and is planning to offer regular support groups for patients, as well as groups for parents and spouses/caregivers of those with IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next event, scheduled to take place before Pesach, will feature a health expert who specializes in IBD, to discuss tips and offer advice regarding staying flare-free and feeling good over Pesach. In addition, CHCCS has a database of recommended Gastroenterologists, surgeons, nutritionists, and psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Yifat Merbl, centre in black, with the rest of her lab team [Weizmann Institute of Science]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were "extremely provocative and very interesting" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that "still needs to be tested" and that will take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: "It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the "safety side of it might be a lot easier".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 01:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQdmQ5NGRGUElEdlZkaEVvWXV5UFVTZDg0VkMzUkpZTFZLbjg5R19zWUo5M1FYd2Y4dElCcGhyemgxYTh5emRwUFNiSmdjMlNKazZyaGlTeWxMNzZvMTlXbFVFdS1lMzN1MXhPNXF4WTV4cVlkLXM1Nl91WER5emR6RjBB</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu spread is ‘slowing down,’ California officials say - POLITICO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNC05TXJTbzFyekltdHphVjJZQ2tmcHFtd0RQV3AzVXRGeDVPMFhSNW1QUGlreUVXczNPQkM0YngxVGFhWUFWYTl2Mmp3SkNxb0U3TXVVbDlYY0ZqU2E3eVE5X3RtRHVlSWF2THc1d3Bmc2pSRUwwTnNHTms4TlpkLVF4dWRpQWpELXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>POLITICO</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:20:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNC05TXJTbzFyekltdHphVjJZQ2tmcHFtd0RQV3AzVXRGeDVPMFhSNW1QUGlreUVXczNPQkM0YngxVGFhWUFWYTl2Mmp3SkNxb0U3TXVVbDlYY0ZqU2E3eVE5X3RtRHVlSWF2THc1d3Bmc2pSRUwwTnNHTms4TlpkLVF4dWRpQWpELXc</guid></item><item><title>LATEST UPDATE: Washoe County School District outbreak status numbers - KTVN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxOTzNXZHRKWnEyNUJaVksydk9WRzg0WEhqeC1iN0M0MjVIVzdwVkN3TTEwMTNHaGNZaU1XcUgwUG1HR1lsMjl4YlhOY0tZRllJQW9VWTAwV2ZpaGdmZnliOXpKQnJnMXBDTzE0YVBhV0ozZ2lpSVlsZ1ZhM1VmdnE1QjR3NXdlN2Zha1Q5UTRtWlcyNjdrMlUwYTllMGoxVUtUajhKczZoc1IzLXhGdUw4M0VOM1JBX1RqcjIwLU9US29ZLVN4SHdLVHhQQi1HclZCUjBiaXhXTHViaU02bTFPRENrLTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium"&gt;

UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Washoe County School District has released updated numbers concerning schools and classrooms in the district on outbreak status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday, there are eight schools on outbreak status and 21 classrooms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the eight schools on outbreak status, two are reporting respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are reporting only gastrointestinal illness, and four are reporting respiratory illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the classrooms, 13 are reporting respiratory illness, five are reporting gastrointestinal illness, and three are reporting hand, foot, and mouth disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARCH 4, 2:56 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District has sent out updated outbreak numbers for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2:45 p.m., they are reporting 8 whole schools on outbreak; four for respiratory illnesses, two for gastrointestinal illnesses, and two schools suffering both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 classrooms are in outbreak status, with 13 classrooms suffering respiratory illness, four dealing with gastrointestinal illness, and three classrooms still dealing with hand, foot and mouth rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARCH 3, 2:52 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated outbreak numbers have been reported by the Washoe County School District. As of 2:30 p.m. today, they are reporting a total of seven whole schools on outbreak status: three for respiratory issues only, two for gastrointestinal issues only, and two for respiratory and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of classrooms in outbreak status remains at 21, with 14 classrooms suffering respiratory illnesses, four suffering gastrointestinal issues and three suffering rashes due to hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district recommends that all families and staff use the WCSD Screening Tool before coming to school - you can find that on &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the WCSD website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 28, 3:16 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District reported updated numbers on Friday afternoon, stating that as of 2:45 p.m., the district increased to six schools on outbreak status, and although there was a decrease to 22 classrooms in total, three of those classrooms are now on outbreak status for a rash known as Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five schools were initially reported on Tuesday before the number jumped to six on Wednesday afternoon, was dropped to four Wednesday night, and then back up to five on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 22 individual classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, two are on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, one is for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District says before arriving at school, all staff members and families should use the WCSD Screening Tool at &lt;a href="https://www.washoeschools.net/selfscreening" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WashoeSchools.net/SelfScreening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families of impacted classrooms or schools get direct notifications and are advised to adhere to outbreak-specific instructions from NNPH and the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit:  &lt;a href="https://www.washoeschools.net/studenthealth" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WashoeSchools.net/StudentHealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district offered some tips for families:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're not feeling well, stay at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handwashing should be done often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use your elbow to cover your cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 27, 3:20 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting a return to five schools on outbreak status and an increase to 23 classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five schools were initially reported on Tuesday before the number jumped to six on Wednesday afternoon and was dropped to four Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon the district announced that there are now five schools and 22 individual classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the five schools, two are on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, one for gastrointestinal only, and two are for respiratory only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 27, 6:25 A.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPAA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting an increase in the number of schools and classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon the district announced that there are now six schools and 20 individual classrooms on outbreak status, up from five and 19 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six schools, one is on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, two are for gastrointestinal only, and three are for respiratory only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 20 classrooms, 15 are on outbreak status for respiratory illness and five are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGINAL ARTICLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several schools and classrooms within the Washoe County School District are on outbreak status as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five entire schools and 19 classrooms are currently on outbreak status according to a WCSD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the schools is on outbreak status for both respiratory and gastrointestinal illness while there are two on outbreak status for respiratory illness and two for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 19 classrooms listed on outbreak status, 15 are for respiratory illness and four are for gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the specific schools and classrooms on outbreak status were not provided by the School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, Cleveland Clinic estimates that by adulthood, nearly &lt;em&gt;every human being &lt;/em&gt;will have contracted at least three types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some HHVs come in the form of relatively mild illnesses like chicken pox, while other forms include shingles, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2 (which can manifest as oral cold sores or genital herpes) or roseola (usually in infants and young children). Some HHVs are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/eating-daily-may-reduce-dementia-151500487.html" data-ylk="slk:Eating This Daily May Reduce Dementia Risk, According to Doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Eating This Daily May Reduce Dementia Risk, According to Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Are HHVs Linked to Alzheimer's and Dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most HHVs, when suppressed by our immune systems and considered "latent," are relatively harmless. However, the Cleveland Clinic study found that in aging patients, the body's ability to suppress HHVs may be reduced. If and when these viruses become activated, that's when problems may arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HSV-1, specifically, may activate "jumping genes," or transposable parts of the human genome. When this happens, these "jumping genes" can cause disruptions in the brain, which may in turn impact accumulation of tau protein, which is linked with inflammation in the brain and neurodegeneration, potentially contributing to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/study-reveals-surprising-factor-may-142500059.html" data-ylk="slk:New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Can You Protect Yourself From HHVs, Alzheimer's and Dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By now, you probably know that &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/long-brain-fog-11-best-203707650.html" data-ylk="slk:a;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/diet-may-slow-brain-aging-152500034.html" data-ylk="slk:brain-healthy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;brain-healthy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/anti-inflammatory-diet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/losing-muscle-higher-risk-dementia-alzheimers-study-december-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:regular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-best-workout-dementia-prevention-233500451.html" data-ylk="slk:exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; are good ways to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/following-type-eating-plan-could-172500252.html" data-ylk="slk:protect yourself against dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;protect yourself against dementia&lt;/a&gt; and Alzheimer's (or to at least slow their progress).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the HHV link may make you feel almost hopeless, there's good news: The study found that anti-virals may actually remedy the link between herpes viruses and dementia by forcing the HHVs to go back to being latent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These results further suggest potential relationships between HSV-1 infection and Alzheimer's disease and provide two potential drug candidates that may provide treatment for a disease that currently has no cure," Dr. Cheng &lt;a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/herpesviruses-may-contribute-to-alzheimers-disease-via-transposable-elements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:explained;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers developed a novel method to keep test subjects’ eyes open, allowing them to monitor these dynamics without disrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that pupil changes correspond to sleep stages, brain waves, and responsiveness to sound, suggesting the brain remains highly active even at rest. This discovery could lead to new ways of diagnosing and treating sleep disorders and other neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil Fluctuations:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size changes during sleep, reflecting brain activation levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linked to Sleep Stages:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil dynamics correlate with deep sleep waves and memory-related brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Tracking pupil changes could help diagnose sleep disorders and neurological conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our eyes are typically closed when we sleep. However, there is a flurry of activity taking place beneath our closed eyelids: a team of researchers, led by principal investigators Caroline Lustenberger, Sarah Meissner and Nicole Wenderoth from the Neural Control of Movement Lab at ETH Zurich, have observed that the size of the pupil fluctuates constantly during sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it increases in size, sometimes it decreases; sometimes these changes occur within seconds, other times over the course of several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-pupil-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;. They hope to discover whether this region of the brain is in fact responsible for controlling the pupils during sleep, and how changes in the level of activation affect sleep and its functions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These dynamics reflect the state of arousal, or the level of brain activation in regions that are responsible for sleep-wake regulation,” says Lustenberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These observations contradict the previous assumption that, essentially, the level of arousal during sleep is low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, these fluctuations in pupil size show that even during sleep, the brain is constantly switching between a higher and lower level of activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new findings also confirm for humans what other research groups have recently discovered in studies on rodents, who also exhibit slow fluctuations in the activation level (known in the field as arousal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by the ETH researchers was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New method for an old mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions of the brain which control the activation level are situated deep within the brainstem, making it previously difficult to directly measure these processes in humans during sleep. Existing methods are technically demanding and have not yet been established in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers’ study therefore relies on pupil measurements. Pupils are known to indicate the activation level when a person is awake. They can therefore be used as markers for the activity in regions situated deeper within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers developed a new method for examining the changes in people’s pupils while asleep: using a special adhesive technique and a transparent plaster, they were able to keep the eyes of the test subjects open for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main concern was that the test subjects would be unable to sleep with their eyes open. But in a dark room, most people forget that their eyes are still open and they are able to sleep,” explains the study’s lead author, Manuel Carro Domínguez, who developed the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the data showed that pupil dynamics is related not just to the different stages of sleep, but also to specific patterns of brain activity, such as sleep spindles and pronounced deep sleep waves – brain waves that are important for memory consolidation and sleep stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the brain reacts to sounds with varying degrees of intensity, depending on the level of activation, which is reflected in the size of the pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central regulator of the activation level is a small region in the brainstem, known as the locus coeruleus. In animals, scientists have been able to show that this is important for the regulation of sleep stages and waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ETH researchers were unable to prove in this study whether the locus coeruleus is indeed directly responsible for pupil changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are simply observing pupil changes that are related to the level of brain activation and heart activity,” Lustenberger explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, the researchers will attempt to influence the activity of the locus coeruleus using medication, so that they can investigate how this affects pupil dynamics. They hope to discover whether this region of the brain is in fact responsible for controlling the pupils during sleep, and how changes in the level of activation affect sleep and its functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Using pupillary dynamics to diagnose illnesses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding pupil dynamics during sleep could also provide important insights for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore want to investigate whether pupil changes during sleep can provide indications of dysfunctions of the arousal system. These include disorders such as insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and possibly Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are just hypotheses that we want to investigate in the future,” says Lustenberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another goal is to make the technology usable outside of sleep laboratories, such as in hospitals where it could help to monitor waking in coma patients or to diagnose sleep disorders more accurately. The pupil as a window onto the brain could thus pave the way for new opportunities in sleep medicine and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and brain activity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#254844574c444b4b400b4950464c404b654d4e0b40514d5f0b464d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marianne Lucien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hk.ethz.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marianne Lucien – ETH Zurich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57289-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pupil size reveals arousal level fluctuations in human sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Sarah Meissner et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil size reveals arousal level fluctuations in human sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent animal research has revealed the intricate dynamics of arousal levels that are important for maintaining proper sleep resilience and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, changes in arousal level are believed to be a determining characteristic of healthy and pathological sleep but tracking arousal level fluctuations has been methodologically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we measured pupil size, an established indicator of arousal levels, by safely taping the right eye open during overnight sleep and tested whether pupil size affects cortical response to auditory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that pupil size dynamics change as a function of important sleep events across different temporal scales.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCSF researchers may have discovered how the female brain remains resilient in aging, answering an age-old question of how most women outlive men and retain their cognitive abilities longer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Females carry two X chromosomes. One of them is ensconced in a corner in the cell called the Barr body, where it can't express many genes, and scientists thought it didn't do much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the UCSF team discovered that as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/female+mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;female mice&lt;/a&gt; reached the equivalent of about 65 human years, their 'silent' second X started expressing genes that bolster the brain's connections, increasing cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men," said Dena Dubal, MD, Ph.D., a professor of neurology and the David A. Coulter Endowed Chair in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease at UCSF. She is the senior author of the new paper, which appears on Mar. 5 in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listening for whispers from the silent X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To track whether any genes on the silent X might, in fact, be active, Dubal collaborated with genomics expert Vijay Ramani, Ph.D., professor at UCSF and investigator in the Gladstone Institute for Data Science &amp;amp; Biotechnology and Barbara Panning, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists created hybrid mice from two different strains of laboratory mouse and engineered the X chromosome from one strain to be silent. Since they knew the genetic code for each strain, they could track the source of any expressed genes back to each X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus—a key brain region for learning and memory that deteriorates during aging—in 20-month-old female mice, which were akin to 65-year-old humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, in several different cell types of the hippocampus, the X chromosome that was supposed to be silent instead expressed about 20 genes. Many of them play a role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt;, as well as intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aging had awakened the sleeping X," Dubal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We immediately thought this might explain how women's brains remain resilient in typical aging, because men wouldn't have this extra X," said Margaret Gadek, a graduate student in the MD Ph.D. program at UCSF and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A not-so-silent X leads to a brain-restoring factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the 22 genes that had 'escaped' silencing on the X chromosome, PLP1, stood out to the researchers. PLP1 helps build the neural insulation, or myelin, that surrounds the brain's wires, so they can transmit their signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old female mice had more PLP1 in the hippocampus than old male mice, suggesting that the extra PLP1 from the second X chromosome had made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether PLP1 could explain the resilience of the female brain, the team artificially expressed PLP1 in the hippocampus of female and male old mice. The extra PLP1 provided a brain boost in both sexes, and these mice did better on tests of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubal and her colleagues are now investigating whether the second X also may be active in older women. They have reason to believe it might: an analysis of donated &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; from older men and women, facilitated by Katilin Casaletto, professor of neurology at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, found that only women had elevated PLP1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cognition is one of our biggest biomedical problems, but things are changeable in the aging brain, and the X chromosome clearly can teach us what's possible," Dubal said. "Are there interventions that can amplify genes like PLP1 from the X chromosome to slow the decline—for both women and men—as we age?"&lt;/p&gt;

            A common but potentially dangerous vaginal infection that affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bacterial-vaginosis" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 in 3 women&lt;/a&gt; globally should be considered a sexually transmitted disease, a new study says.

            Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is currently viewed as a woman’s issue, thus leaving the sexual partner untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I started getting them quite recurrently. I’d go to doctors and get treated with antibiotics, and it would almost always come back,” said Hanae, a woman who participated in the clinical trial on BV conducted in Melbourne, Australia.

            For half of all women with bacterial vaginosis, the infection returns after completion of a week of antibiotics, the preferred medical treatment for BV, said first author Lenka Vodstrcil, a senior research fellow at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre at Monash University in Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000k3b6migl20api@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The bacteria that cause BV can be located in men, especially in penile skin and also in the urethra,” Vodstrcil said in a news release. “This suggests that BV is probably sexually transmitted, and that is why so many women get it back again after treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When BV was treated as a sexually transmitted disease, with both partners receiving oral antibiotics and men using topical creams, the recurrence rate dropped by over half, according to the study &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact a STI (sexually transmitted infection),” said senior author Catriona Bradshaw in an email. Bradshaw is a professor at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre at Monash University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bacterial-vaginosis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of BV can include itching, pain while urinating, an odd odor and a thin, white vaginal discharge. For some women, however, BV is a silent predator, attacking without such telltale symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000o3b6mojfbx4r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If left untreated, bacterial vaginosis can increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3788616/" target="_blank"&gt;acquiring HIV&lt;/a&gt; as well as sexually transmitted infections, according to the World Health Organization. Women with BV can also develop an infection in the fallopian tubes, ovaries or uterus called pelvic inflammatory disease, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bacterial-vaginosis" target="_blank"&gt;the WHO states on its website.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Such infections can lead to later infertility, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000q3b6mtrxussf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We see very significant changes in a range of inflammatory markers, inflammatory cells and bacterial enzymes and products that result in damage to the epithelium — the lining of the reproductive tract,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000r3b6m9va5i0gi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bacterial vaginosis is especially dangerous during pregnancy. The infection can lead to premature birth, spontaneous abortion and low birth weight in the baby, according to the WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000s3b6m8mk4h6m8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The randomized clinical trial of 164 monogamous couples was conducted at multiple centers in Australia. In 81 of the couples, both partners were treated with seven days of oral antibiotics. During that time, the male partner also used a topical antibiotic on their penis twice a day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000t3b6mtotxhxhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In accordance with current recommended treatment, only the woman in the other 83 couples was treated with an oral antibiotic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000u3b6m8lsuuynw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study only treated heterosexual couples, it’s “important to note that women in same sex relationships also transmit BV bacteria between each other during sex, and that these same sex couples in monogamous relationships have very high rates of concordance for BV — both have it or both don’t have it,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000v3b6m2cdnnd4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The trial was meant to last for 12 weeks, but researchers stopped it early when it was quickly apparent that treating both partners reduced BV occurrence by 60%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr1000w3b6mb2qe6bd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viewing such a common vaginal infection as a sexually transmitted disease would be a “paradigm shift” and would require doctors to encourage a woman’s male partner to share responsibility for transmission and treatment, according to an editorial&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published alongside the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It will also require a willingness of male partners to commit to taking both oral and topical medications, once notified by their female partner that she has bacterial vaginosis and that it is probably sexually transmitted,” wrote Dr. Christina Muzny and Dr. Jack Sobel, who were not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Men in the study had no problem completing the course of oral and topical antibiotics, with few to no side effects, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100103b6m5patfce6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have now used this medication in close to 300 men and we have not had any report that side effects from the medication would stop them taking it,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100113b6makscikci@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre has already changed its protocols and are now treating both partners when BV is detected, Bradshaw added. For health professionals and couples interested in treating both partners, the research team is developing a website&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that provides detailed information on male partner treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7w96mr100123b6mvggb4elm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Changes in national and international treatment guidelines always take time, so we felt an obligation to provide accurate online and downloadable information,” Bradshaw said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            A common but potentially dangerous vaginal infection that affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bacterial-vaginosis" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 in 3 women&lt;/a&gt; globally should be considered a sexually transmitted disease, a new study says.

            Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is currently viewed as a woman’s issue, thus leaving the sexual partner untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I started getting them quite recurrently. I’d go to doctors and get treated with antibiotics, and it would almost always come back,” said Hanae, a woman who participated in the clinical trial on BV conducted in Melbourne, Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;BV is thought to affect up to a third of reproductive-aged women and is caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the vagina and a reduction in “good”

It has also been associated with an increased risk of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in Australia report how they studied two groups of monogamous, heterosexual couples in which the women had BV. In one group of 81 couples, the women and their male partners were given oral and topical antimicrobial treatment. In the other group of 83 couples, only women received the tablets and cream. The results were stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board after 150 couples had completed the 12-week follow-up period because treatment of the woman only was inferior to treatment of both the woman and her male partner,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Overall, 24 of 69 women (35%) in the group where both partners were treated had BV return, compared with 43 of the 68 women in the group where only women were treated. In addition, the team found the average time until an infection returned was longer when both partners were treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While sex has long been known to be a trigger for BV, experts previously thought it did not meet the criteria for a sexually transmitted infection, partly because earlier research found no improvement in cure rates in women with BV when male partners were given oral antimicrobials alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Janet Wilson, a consultant in sexual health at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust who was not involved with the work, said the study, while small, supported the view BV was an STI. But she added that many people with BV became “celibate” and found the condition could still be difficult to clear &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;meaning treating partners did not provide a full solution for preventing infections recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is a great paper and it will change how we manage BV in those in long-term monogamous relationships,” she said, adding it was a “big step forward”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the NHS website’s current page on BV, she said: “Much of the information is outdated and misleading.

Researchers identified two types of neurons—one responding to both stimuli and another selectively activated by either pain or itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced synaptic analysis and chemogenetic techniques, they found that these neurons receive separate inputs from the mediodorsal thalamus. The findings challenge the long-held belief that pain and itch share the same neural pathways, providing new insights into how the brain differentiates between these sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Neural Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Pain and itch are processed by separate neuronal populations in the ACC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Neuronal Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some neurons respond to both stimuli, while others are stimulus-specific.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding these circuits may help develop treatments for chronic pain and itch disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research team led by KAANG Bong-Kiun, director of the Center for Cognition and Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), and KO Hyoung-Gon, professor at Kyung Hee University College of Dentistry, have uncovered the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of pain and itch in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides new insights into how the brain distinguishes between these two distinct sensory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain and itch are both unpleasant sensations, but they trigger different responses—pain often prompts withdrawal, while itching leads to scratching. Until now, scientists have struggled to understand how the brain processes these sensations separately, as they share overlapping neural pathways from the spinal cord to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stimuli are transmitted from the spinal cord to the thalamus and brainstem, eventually reaching the ACC. The ACC is a key brain region involved in various functions, ranging from basic sensory processing to higher-order cognition. However, a comprehensive understanding of how a limited number of neurons within the ACC execute such diverse functions has been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides fundamental insights into how ACC neurons selectively process pain and itch information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing neuronal response patterns in the ACC to pain and itch stimuli, the research team identified two distinct neuronal populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Non-selective neurons, which respond to both pain and itch stimuli indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Stimulus-specific neurons, which were selectively activated by either pain or itch stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, using the dual-eGRASP technique—an advanced synaptic analysis method developed by Kaang’s research team (Science, 2018)—the researchers discovered that stimulus-specific neurons in the ACC receive distinct synaptic inputs from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding indicates that pain and itch are processed by independent neuronal populations within the ACC, which receive differentiated synaptic inputs, providing fundamental insights into the neural mechanisms of pain and itch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further confirm the role of these neurons, the team used chemogenetic techniques to selectively deactivate either pain-specific or itch-specific neurons. The results showed suppressing pain neurons reduced pain perception without affecting itch, and vice versa. This discovery suggests that these neurons play a direct role in shaping how we experience pain and itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study presents a groundbreaking discovery that the role of ACC neurons in processing pain or itch is predetermined. Importantly, the study demonstrates that pain- and itch-specific neurons in the ACC are synaptically paired with corresponding stimulus-specific neurons in the MD, establishing independent neural circuits for pain and itch processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge the conventional assumption that pain and itch signals follow overlapping pathways and instead highlight distinct neural mechanisms for each sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the ACC is known to mediate the affective aspects of pain and itch, this study suggests that separate neuronal populations are responsible for encoding the subjective experience of pain and itch. Building upon these findings, the research team aims to further investigate the brain’s complex sensory processing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author KAANG Bong-Kiun stated, “The ACC is an important brain area not only for memory storage but also for processing higher-order emotions such as pain and conflict. Through this study, we have taken a step further in understanding emotional memory at the synaptic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-corresponding author and first author KO Hyoung-Gon commented, “I am particularly interested in how these pain- and itch-selective neural circuits change under pathological conditions. Moving forward, we plan to expand our research to explore the interactions between these circuits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b6c72777772686e735b72796835697e357069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Insititute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57041-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Processing of pain and itch information by modality-specific neurons within the anterior cingulate cortex in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by KAANG Bong-Kiun et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing of pain and itch information by modality-specific neurons within the anterior cingulate cortex in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain and itch are aversive sensations with distinct qualities, processed in overlapping pathways and brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is critical for their affective dimensions. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying their processing in the ACC remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify modality-specific neuronal populations in layer II/III of the ACC in mice involved in pain and itch processing. Using a synapse labeling tool, we show that pain- and itch-related neurons selectively receive synaptic inputs from mediodorsal thalamic neurons activated by pain and itch stimuli, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reduced pruriception or nociception without affecting the opposite modality. Conversely, activation of these neurons did not enhance stimulus-specific responses but commonly increased freezing-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that the processing of itch and pain information in the ACC involves activity-dependent and modality-specific neuronal populations, and that pain and itch are processed by functionally distinct ACC neuronal subsets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 21:53:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBLdkJVc0xkMWw3T1pBVFZlQ3o2ZHJ6Vi1ONWNVWEJIX1ktTEZ0NTU3ZThGd1ZSU2txcUZ4UUw0Q3FrQnMza1BKRGVCV2V4Q2FMOUczOE5iLXV0YkxhYkRnNg</guid></item><item><title>The #1 Habit to Help Prevent Dementia, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5TemhQTkh4VnQ0RjZtX3duOFZKVFZwSXVPTC0zVl92aUJrMUd3Ynh1aWsxWmRwLWlsVHlPR1lWTHcyam8tb0RRa1dORzN0cmYzdFVlUUdlT2hnV0JVME1xdEJwcnBpUFRUb2txUkdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common condition that causes &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;problems with memory and thinking skills&lt;/a&gt;, which is to say that it causes dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Alzheimer’s is sometimes caused when certain proteins, called beta-amyloid and tau, build up in the brain, leading to inflammation, brain cell damage and a decline in mental abilities.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Evidence suggests that physical activity may protect the brain by improving how it adapts, reducing inflammation and improving blood flow—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-to-lower-dementia-risk-41-11687021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;even if you only exercise a bit each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some studies in animals even show that exercise can lower the harmful proteins in the brain, though the results in humans are less clear.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This highlights the need for more research to fully understand how exercise might influence these changes in the brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored how physical activity and certain blood markers, known as plasma biomarkers, relate to memory and thinking abilities. These results were published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study examined mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease using advanced methods across 25 centers in South Korea. Participants were carefully selected, with more than 1,100 individuals completing assessments like memory tests, blood analysis and brain scans. The study followed strict ethical guidelines and excluded anyone with conditions that could interfere with the results. Physical activity was measured via self-reports or caregiver input, and blood samples were analyzed for specific biomarkers linked to brain health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers accounted for variables like age, sex and health conditions, with additional adjustments to account for amyloid-beta, a known factor affecting biomarkers and cognition. Statistical analysis was conducted using specialized software.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at how being physically active relates to brain health, specific proteins in the blood and thinking abilities. Researchers found three main things. First, people who were more physically active had lower levels of two harmful brain proteins (NfL and ptau217), which are linked to Alzheimer’s, and they performed better on memory and thinking tests. Second, these benefits were especially noticeable in older people and those already showing some signs of cognitive problems. Third, physical activity may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;directly improve brain health&lt;/a&gt; and thinking or may work indirectly by slowing down Alzheimer’s-related changes in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study suggests that staying active might help protect against brain aging and diseases like Alzheimer’s, scientists need more research to fully understand how physical activity influences the brain over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has many strengths. It included a large group of more than 1,000 participants from multiple centers, which helps make the results more applicable to a wider range of people and reduces the chances of bias that can happen in studies conducted at a single location. The study also used plasma biomarkers as a way to measure outcomes, which are expected to be useful in future treatments for physical activity interventions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, there are some limitations to note. Since the study was cross-sectional, it shows associations but cannot prove cause-and-effect relationships. The mediation analyses were based on a hypothesis but are limited in this type of study and need further confirmation in future research over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study relied on self-reported questionnaires, which can have errors if participants forget details or misreport their activity levels. For participants with cognitive impairment, data provided by caregivers may also vary depending on their knowledge of the participant’s routines and their ability to recall accurately. Lastly, this study was carried out in South Korea, so the results may not apply to other populations with different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. More research in diverse groups is necessary to confirm how broadly these findings can be applied.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recent study suggests that incorporating physical activity may play a role in reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, particularly among a specific population. As such, it may be worthwhile to start including physical activity in your lifestyle if you are focused on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-conditions-that-may-increase-your-risk-for-cognitive-decline-8756345" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing your Alzheimer’s disease risk&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is important to consult with a health care provider before making major lifestyle changes to ensure that any new activity aligns with your health needs and abilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that physical activity &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;doesn’t have to be strenuous&lt;/a&gt; to make a difference. Even small steps, like a daily walk or light stretching, can have a meaningful impact over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other ways to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-exercises-for-women-over-50-8966927" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate physical activity&lt;/a&gt; into your routine include swimming, dancing, gardening or practicing yoga. Additionally, you can try incorporating more movement into your daily tasks, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away to encourage walking or even doing household chores with more vigor. Small, consistent efforts can add up to significant benefits over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s essential to remember that there’s no single solution to preventing Alzheimer’s, but adding regular movement to your life is a proactive step that can support overall well-being. The key is to find activities you enjoy and make them a sustainable part of your daily routine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the connection between physical activity and brain health offers a hopeful path forward in addressing Alzheimer’s disease. While it’s clear that staying active may help reduce certain harmful brain proteins and improve memory and thinking abilities, more research is needed to better understand these effects and how they vary across different populations. This study highlights an important piece of the puzzle, reinforcing the idea that lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, can play a role in supporting brain health alongside other medical and therapeutic interventions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting physical activity doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or unattainable. Simple, consistent actions—like daily walks, engaging in hobbies or participating in community fitness classes—can create measurable benefits over time. What’s most important is finding activities that you genuinely enjoy, as these will be much easier to sustain in the long term. Alzheimer’s disease is undoubtedly complex, but by taking steps toward a more active lifestyle, you contribute to not just your physical health but also your mental and emotional well-being. The journey toward better brain health is one step at a time, and every effort counts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="stph_caption"&gt;People who undergo surgery just before the weekend have a significantly increased risk of death and complications, researchers reported Tuesday in JAMA Network Open. Adobe stock/HealthDay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
		
		&lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks facing surgery on a Friday may want to consider rescheduling if they can based on findings from a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who undergo surgery just before the weekend have a significantly increased risk of death and complications, researchers reported Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "weekend effect" occurred across 25 common procedures representing multiple surgical specialties, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Patients who underwent surgery immediately preceding the weekend had a significantly increased risk of complications, readmissions, and mortality compared with those treated after the weekend," a team led by senior investigator &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/raj-satkunasivam/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Raj Satkunasivam&lt;/a&gt; of Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important for health care systems to assess how this phenomenon may impact their practices to ensure that patients receive excellent care irrespective of the day," researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals and health care systems tend to operate with skeleton crews during the weekend, leading to concerns that patients are more likely to receive worse care on Saturday and Sunday, researchers said in background notes. This is commonly called the "weekend effect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend effect might also apply to people undergoing surgery immediately before the weekend, who will be in the hospital recuperating after their procedure, researchers explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, researchers analyzed data on nearly 430,000 patients who underwent surgery in Ontario, Canada between 2007 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that people who underwent surgery prior to the weekend had a higher risk of death at 30 days (9% increase), 90 days (10%) and one year (12%) compared to surgeries performed after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-weekend surgical patients also fared worse on a composite score combining death, complications and need for rehospitalization, with a 5% increased risk at 30 days and one year following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to reduced personnel, there are other reasons why hospitals might provide worse care close to the weekend, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More junior surgeons with fewer years of experience operate on Friday compared with Monday, and doctors working the weekend have less access to more senior colleagues and specialists, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, weekend teams may be less familiar with the patients than the weekday team previously managing care," researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors also might have less access to tests and scans that could better help guide their treatment of patients, researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further study is needed to understand differences in care that may underpin these observations and ensure that patients receive high-quality care regardless of the day of the week," researchers concluded.

This is because not only was the study done in mice, but refined carbs have been linked to other health issues that can raise colon cancer risk, such as obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too many carbs, particularly refined sugars, has been linked to a host of health problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber-rich foods like berries, lentils, and nuts, meanwhile, could lower the risk of cancer by helping stool move smoothly through the colon, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study concluded that a lack of carbohydrates and fiber dramatically increases cancer risk when combined with certain E coli bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the rise of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 over the past two decades. This shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alberto Martin, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto and senior author said: 'Colorectal cancer has always been thought of as being caused by a number of different factors including diet, gut microbiome, environment and genetics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our question was, does diet influence the ability of specific bacteria to cause cancer?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13710593/How-keto-diets-WRECK-body-ultra-low-carb-plan-raises-cholesterol-reduces-friendly-gut-bacteria-experts-discover.html"&gt;low-carb diet &lt;/a&gt;cuts out foods like white pasta and bread and instead focuses on protein such as fish, fats such as nuts and avocados as well as non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli and celery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet has been linked to several health benefits including stabilizing blood sugar levels, reducing insulin resistance in people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7ea2b180-f9d0-11ef-be27-91ceb1a3b4f3"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and improve cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, seven percent of Americans - 23million - follow low-carb diets like keto, and interest in them has nearly doubled in the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, colon cancer has surged in young Americans, with diagnoses &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11808449/Mystery-colon-cancer-epidemic-young-people-America.html" class=""&gt;expected to nearly double from 2010 to 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6574107/Colorectal-cancer-rates-deaths-soaring-especially-young-adults.html" class=""&gt;struck with the colon cancer this year, and just under 53,000 will die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, about 19,550 people under age 50 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the new study, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01938-4"&gt;published this week&lt;/a&gt;, examined mice that had already been affected with the bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Helicobacter hepaticus or the E coli strain NC101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bacteroides fragilis has long been known to produce a toxin that can cause inflammation and tissue damage in the colon - leading to colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of Helicobacter hepaticus, some studies have found that its presence in humans can statistically increase the probability of developing and dying from colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Bacteroides fragilis and Helicobacter hepaticus are naturally found inside humans, primarily in the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Monica Ackermann of Australia, pictured at right, was just 31 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the study, the E coli strain NC101 has been found in about 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mice were either fed a balanced, low-carb or Western-style diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results found that the mice who were both infected with E coli NC101 and ate a low-carb diet produced a toxic compound called colibactin, which can damage colon cell DNA and cause polyps to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NC101 strain of E coli has been found in about 60 percent of colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E coli NC101, also known as gut-resident bacteria, is naturally found inside the intestines and helps break down food compounds as well as produce vitamins. While most E coli strains are harmless, NC101 has been linked to colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found that the same group of mice had thinner layer of mucus in their colon as compared to others - indicating that a lack of carbs can thin out the gut mucus layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mucus layer acts as a protective shield between the bacteria in the gut and the cells underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the barrier weakens, more colibactin could reach the colon cells to cause genetic damage and drive cancer tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts believe that a lack of carbohydrates can increase the risk of developing cancer when combined with E coli NC101. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the symptoms and their frequency in early onset patients, those who develop colon cancer before the age of 50, and late onset patients, those who develop the cancer after 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand the team found a diet high in fiber - specifically a prebiotic fiber called inulin - may be able to reverse some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic fiber is a type of dietary fiber that selectively stimulates the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut, known as probiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps improve gut health by stimulating beneficial bacteria, supports digestion and bowel movements along with enhancing immunity against digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic, asparagus, onions, leeks, and artichokes are all high in inulin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not find any significant association between the mice who had Bacteroides fragilis or Helicobacter hepaticus and were fed a low-carb diet with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the study was done on mice, the researchers said more human studies are needed to determine exactly how carbs and fibers are linked to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Martin said: 'These findings could help inform dietary recommendations, probiotic safety guidelines and targeted prevention strategies for high risk individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But at this point, I would agree it would be premature to recommend specific diets to lower the risk of colon cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vitamin A may help with the measles outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A is used worldwide to treat children with measles, but it doesn't prevent infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers have raised concerns that touting vitamin A mirrors anti-vaccine talking points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span&gt;his response to the US &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unvaccinated-child-dies-texas-measles-cases-surge-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the new secretary of health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;/span&gt; has raised eyebrows by touting vitamin A as a possible treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 146 people have been sickened and one child has died from the disease, which is spreading in West Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rfk-jr-plans-to-make-america-healthy-again-2024-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;opposed vaccine mandates,&lt;/a&gt; addressed the outbreak in an op-ed for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. While he acknowledged that the MMR vaccine protects against the disease, he did not explicitly urge Americans to get &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unvaccinated-child-dies-texas-measles-cases-surge-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;saying "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said the CDC released new guidance on using vitamin A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as a potential treatment for measles, adding that a well-balanced diet "remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses." In a subsequent Fox News interview, he suggested treating measles with cod liver oil, a supplement high in vitamin A and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't go down well with public health workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is often touted by vaccine skeptics, including Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization Kennedy formerly chaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin A is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a well-studied treatment for measles, doctors and researchers told Business Insider there's no evidence it can prevent the disease. They expressed concern that Kennedy's message may perpetuate a misconception that supplements could be an alternative to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not nearly a firm enough statement," Andrea Love, an immunologist, told Business Insider. "Good nutrition and vitamin A are not going to stop a measles outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;h2 id="02d2030a-9717-4f6d-be2c-ce5c600bc174" data-toc-id="02d2030a-9717-4f6d-be2c-ce5c600bc174"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, does vitamin A protect against measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, vitamin A is used to treat patients with measles. Both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving vitamin A to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/vitamin-a-for-the-management-of-measles-in-the-us/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;measles patients with vitamin deficiency&lt;/a&gt; from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can deplete the body's supply of vitamin A, and kids deficient in vitamin A are at risk of more severe infections or complications like high fever, blindness, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic doses of vitamin A for measles range between 15,000 to 60,000 micrograms RAE per dose — much higher than the recommended daily amount for vitamin A in your diet, which is between 700 to 900 micrograms RAE. Cod liver oil is not a standard treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is less commonly administered for measles in the US where people tend to get too much vitamin A rather than too little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, dosing up on vitamin A supplements will not protect against a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Sudfeld, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public — and the author of a study that Kennedy cited in his Fox News op-ed — said research supports using vitamin A to reduce the risk of complications from measles, but he stressed that supplementing it won't protect against infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best intervention we have to prevent measles is vaccination. The MMR vaccine is safe and effective for the prevention of measles," he told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7f5d9df5-c453-45cb-a666-c6bd3ac73775" data-toc-id="7f5d9df5-c453-45cb-a666-c6bd3ac73775"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin A can be toxic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using vitamin A is a major talking point for anti-vaccine advocates, who champion supplements as a protective measure, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why Love, the immunologist, was frustrated with Kennedy's op-ed. She felt the resulting message could confuse readers who are already skeptical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who see this are going to pick up on the things that resonate with their beliefs," Love told BI. "The entire wellness industry and pseudoscience landscape plays into the idea of taking control of your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love added that it's possible to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-a-toxicity" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;overdose on vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;. The nutrient is fat-soluble, which means it can build up in the tissues over time. Too much can cause problems like headaches, fatigue, joint pain, liver damage, and reduced bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My concern is people are going to start megadosing vitamin A and we're going to see an increase in toxicity," Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gold standard of protection against measles is &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/how-do-vaccines-work" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;widespread MMR vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to curtail the spread of the highly infectious virus. A vaccinated person can be infectious for days before they show symptoms, and their breath particles can linger in the air for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most effective preventive measure is vaccination, that cannot be overemphasized," Dr. Eduardo Villamor, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

The group that had been exposed to windmill sounds were then asked what sound they had heard, and none were able to identify it as anything other than white noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is far from the first to conclude that "wind turbine syndrome" phenomenon is not rooted in cognitive or acoustic science — and because it was conducted in Poland, the scientists behind it were able to say as much without worrying about losing their academic funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States under Trump's second regime, however, this sort of research would almost certainly not be funded at a public institution due to the president's sweeping anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) push that &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2025/02/21/anti-dei-unsettles-scientists/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;aims to eliminate&lt;/a&gt; such "woke" science from this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious to most even-keeled observers that Trump and Elon Musk's "&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/dei-trump-s-executive-orders-targeting-diversity-policies-are-fueling-backlash" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;anti-woke&lt;/a&gt;" campaign is meant to drive those who oppose their agenda &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/5173991-despite-the-anti-dei-backlash-the-clock-is-ticking-on-the-politics-of-white-resentment/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;out of public life&lt;/a&gt; — but hey, at least Europe still has real science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on the anti-woke agenda:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/trump-nasa-purge-mentions-women" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trump Orders NASA to Purge All Mentions of Women in Leadership On Its Websites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 20:13:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE8wY0ctUy1pMVpOUEdoVmR0ajJOSjduQnlXa0piR21UZEptSVRxekp1SkRfT3Qyc2QyTnlvOVdUeElzdzk1UnB3RGFlek1hV25KS3ExWXFQTTRhMDh3NU4wZWlQLU1BeXVkWGVZeUpOa1hCTmdZN1E</guid></item><item><title>Do weekends really affect surgical outcomes? - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOQkUyVUdqUmQ3YU0tXzJLNVAwQmpyc20xck5EZEJfeW4wN3pBbUh5U1lVakxfaThHMUhiTkJYRHZXZi1RWjNzYnB5cTNsb2dCUXFYSkdINlNKLUZnc25DWF9nc1NkUzNQb0RjbmV0UDQwMmZuQ2QwR1R4WU5QTnViS09MYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Houston Methodist Hospital, UCLA, the University of Toronto, and others have tried to answer a longstanding fear that undergoing surgery on a Friday leads to higher levels of complications or even death. Their analysis of data from 429,691 patients has revealed higher rates of complications, readmissions, and mortality in the days and months following surgery compared to those who had procedures performed after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The "weekend effect" refers to the observed trend of worse patient outcomes associated with medical care provided over weekends. In surgical settings, this effect may be influenced by variations in hospital staffing, access to specialists, and care processes during weekends and is an ongoing concern in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend effect can also refer to a fear on the part of patients that surgical staff may be daydreaming about their weekend plans or that hospitals have less qualified staffing over the weekend. In the past, this weekend effect fear has also been associated with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/automotive+industry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;automotive industry&lt;/a&gt;, where vehicles built on a Friday were thought to have more problems, attributing loose or missing bolts to mentally checked-out mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has previously explored this effect in hospital settings, with some studies reporting increased mortality for Friday surgeries while others found no clear pattern. With conflicting data and dual persistent concerns and fears of a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weekend+effect/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weekend effect&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive investigation was needed to systematically evaluate any impact on postoperative outcomes across a broad range of procedures and timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study "Postoperative Outcomes Following Preweekend Surgery," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort analysis to determine whether patients undergoing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/surgery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; immediately before the weekend faced increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Data from 429,691 adults undergoing one of 25 common surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada, between 2007 and 2019 were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent surgery one day before the weekend (Friday or pre-holiday) and those who had procedures one day after (Monday or post-holiday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed short-term (30 days), intermediate (90 days), and long-term (one year) postoperative outcomes, including mortality, readmissions, complications, hospital length of stay, and duration of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis found that the pre-weekend patient group had longer hospital stays than those in the post-weekend group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing surgery immediately before the weekend had a 5% higher likelihood of experiencing a combination of mortality, complications, and readmissions within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of death was 9% higher at 30 days, and trended higher over time with 10% higher mortality at 90 days and 12% higher at one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, scheduled or elective procedures performed before the weekend were associated with worse postoperative outcomes, while urgent unplanned surgeries showed slightly better outcomes when performed before the weekend. Surgeons operating on Fridays had a median age of 47 years, compared to 48 years for those operating on Mondays. The median years in practice were 14 years for Friday surgeries versus 17 years for Monday surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that variations in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; staffing, reduced access to specialists, and differences in perioperative care processes may contribute to these trends. Future research could assess strategies to ensure high-quality postoperative care, regardless of the day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the underlying causes of these disparities in surgical outcomes are not made clear by the study, both the concerns and fears seem justified by the trends. Hospitals and medical researchers are careful not to suggest the possibility of negligence, such as surgeons daydreaming about three-day weekend plans, yet this very normal human activity also should not be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers say it suggests that women should not be prescribed HRT if they've been menopausal for over 10 years without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gillian Coughlan, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston and first author of the study, said: ‘Our data indicate that HT may influence tau accumulation as a function of age, with implications for cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women who took HRT later had higher levels of a protein called tau in certain brain regions responsible for memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women over 70 years old who had used hormone therapy for menopause showed faster buildup of tau, a key protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a key factor in the genesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which affects nearly seven million Americans annually, around two-thirds of whom are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau proteins help maintain the structure and function of brain cell networks, enabling communication between cells. When this wiring is damaged, tau proteins become loose and break away, leading to communication breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damaged tau proteins clump together, forming toxic tangles in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, these tangles kill brain cells, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;contributing to the cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal Science Advances.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham, an integrated health care system that includes Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals and other health care facilities, recruited 146 women, with an average age ranging from 51 to 89, at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half had used HT an average of 14 years prior and the other half never used it at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had PET scans checking for amyloid beta, another protein believed to be responsible for the onset of Alzheimer's, over an average of four and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph on the left shows that in older women, HT was associated with significantly faster tau accumulation in specific brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex responsible for memory. The graph on the right shows similar increases with age in the inferior temporal gyrus involved in visual processing such as such as faces and objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women also underwent PET scans to look for tau tangles over three and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over 70 who used hormone therapy showed faster tau buildup in brain areas linked to memory and recognition compared to non-users of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tau accumulation was linked to cognitive decline and was only seen in HT users, suggesting that tau buildup might contribute to their cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women under 70, HT use appeared to protect against tau buildup in the area responsible for memory consolidation, with no significant cognitive decline in non-users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are unsure if the faster tau buildup in older HT users is due to when they started therapy or if older individuals naturally show more tau buildup in PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are more likely to have higher levels of tau buildup in brain cells over the course of their lives. This could be driven by an enzyme that lives on the X chromosome, of which women have two copies compared to one in men.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means more of the enzyme enters women’s brains which inhibits the recycling of tau, leading to more build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline in estrogen during menopause is believed to play a major role in the accumulation of tau in women’s brains, likely due to the hormone’s involvement in protecting the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Coughlan said: ‘Our findings add to the evidence that delaying initiation of HT, especially in older women, could lead to worse Alzheimer’s outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be time to find America’s next top bottle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are everywhere — in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389424016327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beauty products&lt;/a&gt; we wear, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972304528X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cleaning supplies&lt;/a&gt; we use and even in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/health/microplastics-found-in-nearly-90-of-meat-plant-based-proteins/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/12/429161/microplastics-air-may-be-leading-lung-and-colon-cancers"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that these particles, smaller than a grain of rice, can harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-022-00605-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a new scientific paper&lt;/a&gt;, three physicians report that switching from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/business/bottled-water-contains-more-plastic-particles-than-previously-thought-study/"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; to filtered tap water could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This diagram shows the chemical components of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a new scientific paper, three physicians report that one switch could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year. Colorful microplastics are shown here under a magnifying glass. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread presence of microplastics in the environment, completely eliminating exposure is unrealistic. A more practical approach is to reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake,” the researchers wrote this week in the Genomic Press.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;This advice may be tough to swallow. Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, &lt;a href="https://bottledwater.org/bottled-water-consumption-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to industry data&lt;/a&gt;, with 16.2 billion gallons consumed, a 2% increase from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, but it’s also a significant source of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t ready to ditch your plastic bottles or don’t have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/health/drinking-water-of-97m-americans-contaminated-with-unregulated-chemicals-study/"&gt;a filter for your tap&lt;/a&gt;, there are other ways to reduce microplastic intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;“Beyond bottled water, significant dietary sources of microplastics are alcohol and seafood,” the researchers wrote. “Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microwaving food in plastic containers can release up to 4.22 million microplastic particles per square centimeter in just a few minutes. Opt for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/shopping/mcirco-meal-prep-containers-deal-amazon/"&gt;glass or stainless steel containers&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other recommendations include not storing food in plastic and limiting consumption of canned and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption,” the researchers wrote. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world’s companies are believed to generate nearly 460 million metric tons of plastic annually — this figure is projected to increase to 1.1 billion metric tons by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans inhale and ingest an estimated &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; a year, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11186737/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics have been detected&lt;/a&gt; in human &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/22/microplastics-found-in-placenta-are-creating-cyborg-baby/"&gt;placentas&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, lungs, livers, testicles and blood, among other organs and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;Startling research&lt;/a&gt; published last month found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon’s worth of tiny shreds of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These particles &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can damage intestinal cells&lt;/a&gt;, trigger inflammation and disturb the balance of bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, the researchers call for more studies on the long-term health effects of microplastics and “clear” limits on their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while “reducing intake is a logical approach,” the researchers wrote, “it remains unclear whether this translates into a measurable reduction in microplastic accumulation within human tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, engaging in health-promoting activities, such as exercise and self-care, may help mitigate these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD in adulthood can create significant challenges in romantic relationships, including poor communication, financial stress, and reduced intimacy. Women often bear the burden more heavily, with some describing their experiences as similar to caring for an “additional child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many studies focus on individuals with ADHD, less research has explored how the condition affects their partners. To address this gap, Dana Zeides Taubin and her research team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem examined the mental health consequences for women in these relationships and explored potential coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 100 heterosexual couples, recruited primarily through social media, in which the male partner had a self-reported ADHD diagnosis. The men were between the ages of 20 and 60 and had been in a cohabiting relationship for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women, who averaged 33 years old, did not have ADHD themselves. They completed surveys assessing their depressive symptoms, quality of life, and participation in health-promoting activities. Additionally, they rated their partners’ ADHD-related impairments, including difficulties with time management, impulsivity, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationships between ADHD-related impairment, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several important patterns emerged. Women with partners who exhibited greater ADHD-related impairments were more likely to experience depression. They also reported a lower quality of life, particularly in social and psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, women who frequently engaged in health-promoting activities—such as exercising, setting aside personal time, or socializing with close friends—reported fewer depressive symptoms and better overall well-being. Furthermore, those whose partners consistently took ADHD medication reported a higher quality of life than those whose partners were inconsistent with treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taubin and colleagues noted that women living with ADHD-diagnosed partners may experience more severe mental health challenges compared to caregivers of individuals with other chronic conditions: “notably, the depression rates in our study exceeded those reported for the broader Israeli female population. Additionally, [the women’s quality of life] scores were lower than those from comparable studies on partners of individuals with other health challenges such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings underscore that both medical treatment for ADHD and self-care strategies for partners may improve relationship satisfaction and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides valuable insights, it has some limitations. Notably, it focused solely on heterosexual couples, meaning its findings may not be generalizable to same-sex relationships or relationships where both partners have ADHD.

A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt5619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; begins to shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers scanned the brains of dozens of women in the weeks before and after childbirth and found that two brain areas involved in the processing and control of emotions increased in size in women who developed symptoms of postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, constitute some of the first evidence that postpartum depression is associated with changes in the brain during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers found that women with symptoms of depression in the first month after giving birth also had increases in the volume of their amygdala, a brain area that plays a key role in emotional processing. Women who rated their childbirth experience as difficult or stressful — a perception that is often associated with postpartum depression — also showed increases in the volume of the hippocampus, a brain area that helps regulate emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is really the first step in trying to understand how does the brain change in people who have a normal course of pregnancy and then those who experience perinatal depression, and what can we do about it,” said Dr. Sheila Shanmugan, an assistant professor of psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology and radiology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The big takeaways are about how there are these really profound brain changes during pregnancy and how now we’re seeing it in depression circuitry specifically,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;While menopause is a very natural phase that every woman goes through, it beckons certain discomforts like night sweats, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/12/health/calm-menopausal-hot-flashes-with-this-low-calorie-snack/"&gt;hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; and mood swings. &lt;/p&gt;

Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed the data of 896 participants with an average age of 64 who typically went through menopause at around 49.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After adding up the number of symptoms — including night sweats, trouble sleeping, changes in mood, hot flashes, weight gain and “brain fog” — they found that women who reported more of these symptoms had greater cognitive impairment, which is considered a precursor for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/your-sense-of-taste-could-predict-if-youre-more-likely-to-die-younger/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and other types of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	



&lt;p&gt;This led the authors to conclude that more menopause symptoms may be associated with experiencing worse cognitive and behavioral decline in later life. Both of those are risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Estrogen-based hormone therapy may contribute to mitigating clinical symptoms, particularly behavioral symptoms,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This corroborates with previous research, such as a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/early-menopause-may-raise-risk-of-dementia-later-in-life?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; that found women who go through menopause before the age of 40 are 35% more likely to develop dementia than those who experience it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around twice as many women have &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/why-dementia-different-women#:~:text=Women%20have%20a%20greater%20risk,risk%20factor%20for%20this%20disease." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; than men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts believe that while some of this may be because women simply live longer on average, the decline in estrogen levels that occurs during menopause could also play a role, given that estrogen is essential for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/having-kids-can-fight-brain-aging-the-more-children-the-better/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But lifestyle factors are also significant, and this new study’s authors &lt;a href="https://plos.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#U0000000Ifis/a/PM000007vUgU/qLBwEBBZgYshFYAD5JRmeKkzuDNSWYgZ7snFITtSY7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that knowing that there’s a link between menopause and Alzheimer’s disease “can allow time for more preventative interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These interventions not only include addressing hormonal status, but also comprise managing vascular risk factors, reducing inflammation from Western diet and environmental toxins, optimizing gut health and gut biome diversity and supporting social interactions,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/health/6-easy-lifestyle-hacks-that-can-slash-your-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;six lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; — exercising, not drinking or smoking, getting enough sleep, socializing and having hobbies — can slash your risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research also suggests &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/antidepressants-may-worsen-dementia-decline-what-to-know/"&gt;anti-depressants&lt;/a&gt; could actually speed up the rate of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people in Ikaria, Greece — an island with shockingly low rates of dementia — swear by tea, coffee and a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/greek-island-with-almost-no-dementia-the-two-drinks-they-love/"&gt;slight twist on the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; as their secret to staying sharp in old age.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416433122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; has unveiled that brain aging follows a distinct yet nonlinear trajectory with critical transition points. The research, conducted by an international team of scientists led by Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Ph.D., of Stony Brook University, offers new insights into when interventions to prevent cognitive decline might be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+networks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain networks&lt;/a&gt; in more than 19,300 individuals across four large-scale datasets. Their findings reveal that functional communication between brain regions (brain networks) begins to destabilize around age 44, with the degeneration of brain networks accelerating most rapidly at age 67 and plateauing by age 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transition points follow an S-shaped statistical curve with clear transition points, rather than either the late-life clinical onset or gradual linear decline previously assumed, suggesting there are specific windows when intervention could be most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding exactly when and how brain aging accelerates gives us strategic timepoints for intervention," says lead author Mujica-Parodi, Director of the Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics (LCNeuro), Baszucki Endowed Chair for Metabolic Neuroscience, and Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've identified a critical midlife window where the brain begins to experience declining access to energy but before irreversible damage occurs, essentially the 'bend' before the 'break.' During midlife, neurons are metabolically stressed due to insufficient fuel; they're struggling, but they're still viable," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, providing an alternative fuel during this critical window can help restore function. However, by later ages, neurons' prolonged starvation may have triggered a cascade of other physiological effects that make intervention less effective."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers not only mapped this aging trajectory but identified its primary driver: neuronal insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers, they found that metabolic changes consistently preceded vascular and inflammatory ones. Gene expression analyses further implicated the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 and the lipid transport protein APOE (a known Alzheimer's risk factor) in these aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these same gene expression analyses also identified the neuronal ketone transporter MCT2 as a potential protective factor, suggesting that enhancing the brain's ability to utilize ketones—an alternative brain fuel that neurons can metabolize without insulin—might be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding of the ketone transporter then motivated an interventional study, in which researchers compared administration of individually weight-dosed and calorically matched glucose and ketones to 101 participants at different stages along the aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking in this cohort. Unlike glucose, ketones effectively stabilized deteriorating brain networks, but with effects that differed significantly across critical transition points. Ketones showed moderate benefits in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt; (20–39 years), showed maximum benefits during the midlife "metabolic stress" period (40–59 years), after which networks begin destabilizing, but had diminished impact in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; (60–79 years) once the network destabilization hit maximum acceleration and the domination of compounding vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi and co-authors say that these findings could revolutionize approaches to preventing age-related &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments typically target symptoms after they appear, often too late for meaningful intervention. This research suggests that metabolic intervention—whether through dietary approaches like ketogenic diets or supplements—might be most effective when started in one's 40s, well before cognitive symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention," notes Botond Antal, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Associate in Biomedical Engineering at Stony Brook and first author. "Rather than waiting for cognitive symptoms, which may not appear until substantial damage has occurred, we can potentially identify people at risk through neurometabolic markers and intervene during this critical window."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a public health standpoint, these findings could inform new screening guidelines and preventive approaches, emphasizes Mujica-Parodi. Early (midlife) identification of increasing insulin resistance in the brain (not just the blood), coupled with targeted metabolic interventions, might substantially delay cognitive aging for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the global population aging rapidly and dementia cases projected to triple by 2050, these insights into the timing and mechanisms of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+aging/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; offer new hope for preventive strategies that could maintain cognitive health well into later life.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not only nutritionally balanced, but it’s also easy to follow and can be customized based on your dietary needs and preferences.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While protein may not be the first word that comes to mind when you think of the foods emphasized on the Mediterranean diet, it certainly has a place in this eating pattern, especially for your morning meal. In fact, nutrition experts agree that starting your day with foods that pack both protein and fiber, like whole grains, dairy, nuts and seeds, may be the best thing you can do to help you feel prepared to tackle your day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here are all the reasons dietitians love this high-protein combo so much!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-overnight-quinoa-pudding"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why We Love Overnight Quinoa Pudding  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First and foremost, this recipe offers a trifecta of healthy fats, protein and fiber in every bite. According to registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.connectwithsage.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elana Natker, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, “The Mediterranean diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. This filling breakfast hits on many of those, offering fiber, protein and healthy fats to keep you fuller longer, reducing your chances of needing a midmorning snack.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 18 grams of protein per serving, our Overnight Quinoa Pudding is crafted to help keep you full until your next meal. In fact, research shows that protein is more satisfying and filling than either fat or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While breakfast isn’t traditionally large in size on a Mediterranean diet, focusing on eating foods that do provide some of this nutrient, including dairy foods like yogurt, can help keep you full as you conquer your morning to-do [list],” says culinary dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.justwendyjo.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wendy Jo Peterson, M.S., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; author of the &lt;em&gt;Mediterranean Diet Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;. Speaking of which, the bulk of the protein content in this recipe comes from kefir, a fermented drink offering 9 grams of protein per 1-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The remaining protein is thanks to the chia seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068328/is-quinoa-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt;—a plant-based protein source containing all nine of the essential amino acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-fiber foods, like berries, vegetables and legumes, are abundant in the Mediterranean diet. In addition to keeping you full for longer, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been linked with benefits for heart and gut health. It may also reduce the risk of certain types of cancer and can support weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Per the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it’s recommended that adults get 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This overnight pudding helps move you closer to your daily fiber goal, offering 9 grams of fiber per serving, depending on the types of berries used. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want to maximize your fiber intake? Raspberries are a treasure trove of fiber, providing 8 grams per 1-cup serving!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contains Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet does not shy away from fats but it does choose them wisely. Olive oil, nuts and seeds are staples of the diet and contribute to its heart-healthy benefits thanks to their concentrations of unsaturated fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While they’re not part of a traditional Mediterranean diet, Peterson notes that chia seeds are an excellent addition to this eating pattern because of their omega-3 content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Our Overnight Quinoa Pudding features 1 tablespoon of these tiny seeds, contributing 2.5 grams of omega-3s to your morning meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Simple, Convenient &amp;amp; Versatile &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe takes about five minutes to make and can be prepared in a large batch, making it a win-win for busy mornings. Plus, you can easily put your own spin on it, swapping in ingredients you have on hand. Prefer honey to maple syrup? Or want to nix the added sugar completely? No problem! Feel free to get creative and adjust the recipe to meet your needs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If getting enough protein seems like a challenge on the Mediterranean diet, we’ve got you covered. “While the Mediterranean diet suggests only one serving of dairy or eggs per day and limiting your red meat intake, other great protein sources that are encouraged in the Mediterranean diet include nuts and nut butters, seafood and poultry,” says Natker. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are three simple swaps that add at least 9 grams of protein per serving to your morning meal: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough protein, fiber and healthy fats at breakfast is key for keeping you fueled, focused and ready to conquer your day. Luckily, our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281101/overnight-quinoa-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Overnight Quinoa Pudding&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent example of how to include this trifecta in the morning, with 18 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 9 grams of fiber per serving. Plus, it’s a good option whether you follow a Mediterranean-inspired diet or simply need a healthy breakfast you can prep the night before.
