This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-anti-inflammatory-dinner-recipes-11756624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory recipes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 318 to 335 calories, while the lunches span 341 to 414 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between natural and added sugars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars are found in fruits, vegetables and dairy. Added sugars are any type of sugar, even "natural" ones like honey and maple syrup, that are added during food processing. Unlike added sugars, which are added purely for sweetness and have little nutritional value, natural sugars are found in foods that provide beneficial nutrients, like fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Added sugars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in our diets can add up because they're often found in foods we wouldn't necessarily expect, like sauces, marinades, cereals and flavored yogurts. It is recommended that you limit added sugars in the diet to no more than 25 grams per day for women and 36 grams per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits of an Anti-Inflammatory Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anti-inflammatory diet is one that includes foods that fight inflammation in the body. These are foods that contain antioxidants, like beta-carotene and anthocyanins, foods containing omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and walnuts, and foods that promote a healthy microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fiber. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to the onset and progression of many chronic conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity. Choosing foods that help to reduce inflammation in the body can help prevent and manage chronic conditions. In addition, excess intake of added sugars can lead to increased risk of chronic low-grade inflammation, so opt for foods with naturally occurring sugars that are also paired with inflammation-fighting nutrients, like colorful fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How We Create Meal Plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create &lt;em&gt;EatingWell’s&lt;/em&gt; meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-protein-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-11757370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 08:34:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE9MSlE3U005YjlWUmxwd1VKM280b000VGVzY1V4djkyU1hsX0txd3hiQ3dhLUhoVThxQVFKbjBYbHYteWhxdXE1bXNQcnREa0V5S2xLaHFCZzhZRkRmTnpaMk9mWWE</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，对肠道健康有益的最佳水果- EatingWell | The Best Fruit for Your Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU3FZRUhmbVViU051VGx0aS1fM004UkR5b0swRDhheF9zZ3dSV1AtZmQ2UGJ0UWZQLWM4ZzFKckh5RXR1Yk80UDJOR182d3Nlb0VGdXJ4cS15YXY4VmExaHhFaUdkSk5SX2VtOWxMbmNaaXlH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most adults don’t consume enough fiber, but incorporating fiber-rich foods like raspberries can be an easy and delicious solution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberries are not only packed with fiber, but are also packed with vitamin C and antioxidants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low in FODMAPs, raspberries are gentle on sensitive stomachs, making them a perfect option for those with IBS or digestive issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most potent sources of fiber is a sweet, versatile, tasty fruit that's an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;editor favorite. It turns out that the same fruit is also a gut-health doctor-recommended option and might be the all-around best fruit for gut health, according to a February 8, 2023, Instagram reel from &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what is the best fruit for gut health? Raspberries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I'm a huge fan of raspberries … First off, they're friggin' delicious," Bulsiewicz shares in the caption. "I mean, seriously. They are like candy, how are they so healthy? But they are!" In the reel, Bulsiewicz continues, "They're super high in fiber. A cup of raspberries has about 7 g of fiber—that's like half of what the average American is getting per day."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bulsiewicz goes on to share more about the many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of raspberries&lt;/a&gt;, including them being rich in nutrients like "vitamin C and polyphenol antioxidants … that are incredibly good for us," he adds. "Believe it or not, even though there's sugar in berries, berries have been shown to reduce our likelihood of developing [type 2] diabetes. And if you have [type 2] diabetes, they can help you to ultimately reverse it."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, Bulsiewicz loves that raspberries are high in fiber and low in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt;—fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. While many of these specific types of carbs are beneficial for people with healthy guts, they have been shown to exacerbate symptoms among those who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In other words, if you have digestive issues and are rebuilding your gut, you should be enjoying raspberries," concludes Bulsiewicz. Thankfully, there are many ways you can do just that. The doctor adores raspberry toasts, raspberry salads, raspberry spritzers and raspberry smoothies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Our Expert Take &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating raspberries has several benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding to your fiber quota&lt;/a&gt;, promoting healthy digestion (even if you struggle with IBS), consuming more vitamins, minerals and polyphenols, and more. But keep in mind that raspberries shouldn't be your only source of fiber. One of the top five things you should do every day to improve your gut and overall health, says Bulsiewicz, is to eat a wide variety of plants, whole grains, healthy fats and protein.&lt;br&gt;

However, overall heart disease death rates over the past five decades dropped by 66% in American adults ages 25 and older, according to a new study. Even better, deaths from heart attacks dropped by nearly 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past 50 years, our understanding of heart disease, what causes it and how we treat it has evolved considerably," said lead study author Dr. Sara King, a second-year internal medicine resident at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been great strides made in helping people survive initial acute cardiac events that were once considered a death sentence," King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that positive news has a flip side. Deaths from all other types of heart disease, including arrhythmia, heart failure and hypertensive heart disease, increased by 81% in the United States, according to the study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to put both sets of numbers into perspective, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These days, the likelihood of dying from a heart attack is relatively low compared to where it's been, but the likelihood of significant disability from the heart attack is still high," said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might develop heart failure — where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs and you're always short of breath," he said. "Or maybe you're on a number of medications for blood pressure, fluid retention and cholesterol, or you never feel your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one thing to be alive; it's another to be alive and well," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cardiovascular risks on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed government data on deaths from heart disease between 1970 and 2022. Back in 1970, heart attacks were responsible for 54% of all deaths from heart issues. By 2022 that number had dropped to 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, which happen when electrical impulses to the heart go awry and cause an irregular heartbeat or "flutter" in the chest, were rare in the 1970s. By 2022, the number had risen to 450% — about 4% of all heart disease deaths, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from heart failure increased 146% over the same time period, while death due to persistent high blood pressure rose by 106%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in cardiovascular risk factors are contributing to the rise in certain types of heart disease, the study said. Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices and physical inactivity have skyrocketed over the past 50 years. Obesity prevalence rose from 15% in 1970 to 40% in 2022, the study found. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes now impacts nearly half of all adults in the United States. High blood pressure increased from 30% in 1978 to nearly 50% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential contributor — the aging baby boomer population now reaching a time when they are most likely to develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these risk factors contribute to an ongoing burden of heart disease, especially as related to heart failure, hypertensive heart disease and arrhythmias," said senior study author Dr. Latha Palaniappan, professor of cardiovascular medicine and associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart disease hasn't gone away," Palaniappan said in a statement. "The focus now must be on helping people age with strong, healthy hearts by preventing events, and prevention can start as early as childhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

She glared at me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What’s it got to do with you?” she asked. “Since you stopped cooking for us, I think I can eat whatever I want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Ever since I went on the weight-loss drug Mounjaro — and consequently lost my appetite and three stone in weight — I have essentially stopped cooking. My daughter’s alleged fondness for cheese strings is, I suspect, a deliberate act designed to rile me. For now I no longer&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; cook and the three children I live with are decidedly not happy about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As they are aged 22, 21 and 18, it’s not that they can’t cook. They’re perfectly capable of cooking for themselves and I very much doubt my daughter is going to eat a cheese string ever. It’s just that they have been brought up on organic this and foraged that. For most of their lives I have banged on about how we are what we eat and the importance of a varied diet and gut health. So much so I think they’d probably come out in an allergic reaction if they ate even a slice of pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My daughter is just making a point, and in many ways it’s a valid one. The way weight-loss drugs work is that they affect the hormone in your brain that tells you to eat. And I love eating. But I’ve been on Mounjaro for eight months and it’s not only affected my body and how I feel about it, but also everyone around me, especially my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I have always been known as someone who likes to cook. It has been something I’ve been incredibly proud of. I didn’t grow up in a particularly food-orientated household. I certainly didn’t cook at university or in my twenties, when I lived on Pot Noodles and soya puddings. But as I grew older and our national interest in food grew, I began to find food and cooking and eating far more interesting and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.4"&gt;&lt;div id="125ba036-675f-49b6-83a4-f7af60d15380"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Lucy Cavendish before Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GEMMA DAY FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In my thirties I was the launch editor of Observer Food Monthly and after that my obsession with food and cooking grew and grew. I met so many chefs, from Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett to Marcus Wareing and Rick Stein. I went on many cooking courses at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s cookery school in Dorset. I went out fishing and learnt how to gut and cook mackerel on an open fire. I made pizza dough from scratch. I rolled out pasta. I went to Italy and learnt how to cook focaccia. In Spain I ate boar in a dark bitter chocolate sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over the years, it’s not just been about the cooking and the food and the taste, it’s been about who I am. So it’s also become part of my children’s lives and part of our identity as a family. We are the family that still had a Sunday roast complete with cauliflower cheese, homemade roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, the works. Even as my children have got older, I’ve produced risottos and baked monkfish with pancetta. They would come back in from work or studying and there would be a delicious meal ready and waiting. It’s always felt like an offering of love that I have wanted to give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That was until I went on Mounjaro and, of course, life changed. It’s very hard to cook for people when you have absolutely no appetite. Every time I look in the fridge, I can’t see a single thing I want to eat. I go to the supermarket, the shops and the farmers’ market, and whereas in the past I was so inspired — buying forest mushrooms and fruit just picked from the trees — I now can’t think of a single thing I want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ll pick up delicious ripe apples and think, hmm … all those lovely fresh fish waiting to be grilled with lemon and butter and salt and pepper? Not one bit of me wants to eat it. I know we need to have food in the fridge but even red pepper hummus, a former favourite, leaves me feeling slightly queasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/mounjaro-weight-loss-injection-nhs-l0g0pg3dc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mounjaro weight-loss injections now available in UK through NHS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then, given that I have no appetite, I don’t find cooking interesting any more. Food has become completely dull and I have begun to wonder why I’d liked it in the first place. It’s extraordinary. I used to spend all day thinking about what to buy and what to cook and how much everyone would love it and how much I would love it, and now I can’t even get a flatbread down me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If I were living on my own, that would be fine. I would have virtually nothing in my fridge except a bit of smoked salmon and some vegetables and fruit. But I’m still living with three out of my four children and there has always been this coming together as a family to eat delicious food prepared by me — it has always felt very bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So they were rather taken aback when it got to the first Sunday of my weight-loss journey and no roast appeared. “Oh, are we having a roast today?” my daughter asked, because she loves a Sunday roast. I told her that I was on my weight-loss injections — I’ve been very honest about that — and that I no longer had any appetite. “But we’ve still got appetites,” she said, looking a little bit hurt. It occurred to me then that if I stopped cooking for them they could make an assumption that I didn’t love them any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It’s not that I don’t love you or care about you,” I told them. “It’s just that I no longer want to cook any food or buy any food or have anything to do with food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weight-loss-injections-jabs-pancreatitis-gv7hrssvt" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fears over weight-loss jabs after ten deaths from pancreatitis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This statement went down like a lead balloon. They looked at me as if I had slapped them across their faces with a fish. “Things are going to have to change,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At first it took a bit of time. There was lots of going to the fridge and staring in it as if food would suddenly appear by magic. I could see my son Leonard’s face fall with disappointment as he would stare at the sad salad wilting in the bottom of the fridge and some ancient soft cheese that was probably going a bit mouldy. My daughter then decided that she would buy some cookbooks and start cooking elaborate meals that essentially involved using every single saucepan and utensil in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“If you won’t cook, I will have to cook,” she said, whirling a ladle above her head. When she got tired of that she obviously decided to go down the cheese string route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My third son, Jerry, decided this was an opportunity for him to go on a protein-based diet so he now bulk-buys endless amounts of cheap chicken breasts and eggs. He seems to exist on nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/shane-watson-mounjaro-l7hk66t5f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nine things we’ll miss when we’re all hooked on Mounjaro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another effect of all this is that everyone eats separately, which is actually a sadness to me. My desire to lose weight and get healthy has had a detrimental effect on our family life. I look better and feel fitter but it’s as if I’ve moved into a completely different world. I’m still not really used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So we are all trying to get to know each other in a slightly different way. I’m not exactly sure how that will work out. At some point I will be off the weight-loss drugs and maybe I’ll go back to producing nonstop delicious meals. Until then, however, the kitchen is going to stink of eggs and the fridge will be full of cheese strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOOUtTR3ZRYnZKVmM4RGI5VXBZYS1CMmtQd2tNRkhZWnhfT0NERE04VElBUFJTV1R5bEJCb1ZtUU8xZG5lMTNYRjNCQ0hZb3lZWk1iODBLajNWUEtCNWcwekF6aXZDZEtSY1hqMmVGS2Rnb2lTRWl0NnRBbmw2aDUtaGNIb3IzcXpOcmNMQXNnMjZzSmVFX3hWV01fWXMxcnJtNFpRSmpHc0NqdzFsZDJoeTFIcmlTakU</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士正在揭示您不应忽视的“小”健康标志，这令人震惊- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRTlHNVEwRnVac2dpVFVTOGdMTU9qd0RoV2FrbW1iWFM5Q0h1NkU0WW9YVVRacUEwZVAzdlpFZFh6cFllbVJhb09HUUFld3hjUmg1ZDVtdkJfQ3pHQUVSWl9qODdZZFVlMDg2TmNmdVVpQk1pQkJKYndINkZrOFdNWUpjNVgyNUtrWXV3MWhtWHR1Mk4wcVY1eQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I work in rehab, bracing, and supports for orthopedic surgeons. A huge wake-up call for my own health was seeing normal, successful people in their 40s to 60s who couldn't do more than one push-up or get up from a seated position on the floor, with chronic back pain, neck pain, obesity, and falling. I assumed you magically lose that strength once you're old and retired, but no!

Plenty of people find themselves taking a power nap to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65026836/foods-that-give-you-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost energy and fight fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;boost energy and fight fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new study shows that napping earlier in the day, along with other factors, could be connected with a high rate of mortality in certain groups. Though the research has yet to be peer reviewed, the findings are interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/Supplement_1/A152/8135607?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;followed 86,565 participants across the United Kingdom from the UK Biobank. The ages of the volunteers ranged from 43 to 79 years, with 57% of the study participants identifying as female and 43% identifying as male. Researchers evaluated participants’ daytime napping behaviors to determine a link between daytime naps and the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What researchers found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed self-reported daytime napping behavior alongside data collected from participants via activity trackers over seven days. Their daytime sleep habits were logged, tracking nap duration, timing, and any variation from existing nap habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data was cross-referenced against other factors, including chronotype (the time of day you prefer to sleep or when you’re the most alert or have the most energy), BMI (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which is not always an accurate predictor of health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which is not always an accurate predictor of health&lt;/a&gt;), demographics, comorbidities, nighttime sleep habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found a strong connection between nap patterns and long-term health risks, including longevity and mortality. Specifically, longer naps, increased individual variability in the lengths of daytime naps, and napping around noon and the early afternoon hours were associated with greater risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the potential importance of considering napping behaviors in risk stratification of mortality in middle-to-older aged adults,” researchers concluded, noting the value of incorporating nap assessments into clinical and public health practices in promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do certain nap patterns increase the risk of death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida &lt;/a&gt;explained that research suggests that shorter daytime naps (under 30 mins) can be associated with some health benefits for older adults, longer naps (60-plus mins) have been linked to increased risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown in this study, “Greater likelihood of napping around noon appears to have a detrimental impact on mortality risk,” Curtis said. “Further, there is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emerging research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emerging research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the variability in napping behavior over time in older adults, such as switching from short to long naps or vice versa, is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why would napping be associated with death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why napping may be associated with greater risk of mortality, according to Curtis, who explains that longer daytime napping itself may be a sign of poor nighttime sleep and sleep disorders—such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a44211864/insomnia-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and obstructive &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a43933932/sleep-apnea-linked-to-increased-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;—which “are known to be associated with worse health trajectories and increased mortality risk if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis explains that the fragmented sleep associated with both of these sleep disorders may disrupt circadian factors and affect daytime alertness, thus leading older adults to nap more easily during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also a reciprocal relationship between napping and worse health outcomes and mortality,” she continues, adding that certain nap patterns in older adults have long been associated with the increased chronic low-grade &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in various other medical conditions linked to worse health outcomes and longevity, “such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64255416/ultra-processed-foods-obesity-brain-changes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, hypertension, and osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more than just the fact that napping may be an indicator of an increased risk for death, Curtis reiterates, but &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:changes in existing nap patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;changes in existing nap patterns&lt;/a&gt; as well. “These metrics, in combination with worse nighttime sleep (such as shorter total sleep time), may predict worse mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the connection between napping and death be broken?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11357-024-01351-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65175910%2Fnegative-health-effects-of-taking-a-nap%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;cites research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the mortality risk associated with longer daytime napping in older adults may be lowered by certain lifestyle factors such as physical activity. “That is, specifically meeting the recommended weekly dosage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) can weaken the association between napping and mortality risk,” she continues. “Such physical activities for older adults could include fast walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, or hiking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis adds that the relationship between napping and mortality may be more nuanced in older adults and depend on sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. “At least &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22951185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that in older men, those who slept less than six hours and napped more than 30 minutes during the day had a higher risk of mortality,” she explains, noting that the same pattern wasn’t found in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Curtis says that when compared to older women, older men have higher rates of frequent nighttime urination and obstructive sleep apnea, both of which are linked to greater daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The longer napping and increased mortality relationship findings in older adults are largely consistent. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been fully determined,” Curtis says. “The napping and mortality relationship is complex and may be influenced by adverse or protective lifestyle factors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, substance use), nighttime sleep patterns, and underlying sleep disorders, medical comorbidities, age, as well as sex and gender-related factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed in this area, this study offers hope in identifying some early predictors of increased mortality and new clinical approaches for promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 19:28:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBsNGEyOFRETk9uYU5XaFNKMTZ4T1NRdGY1ZDhSRVFldDJ2QUMtY1p4aFF3ZjZSZjBGbmVrZzVSYkdmN0JGemx6d0lVRENyWldDeHNmdm93OGhweDRCMndLYlY4UkJfUlBmaVNnR2h5RDZhTzVOMFNEbTN6TEIwUQ</guid></item><item><title>据EatingWell专家介绍，下午5点后应避免4件事，以降低中风风险 | 4 Things to Avoid After 5 P.M. to Reduce Stroke Risk, According to Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaGRDd3pXb3FOVDA5TTU4cldCN3hGcUZRNjh5SlFES0pQdWFQbHhCUENXRmNCRjBJTi1ndXNlUjR4VkFyNEo5aDJfVE5XNGw4TkZCQmhqZl9IU0xUYldnbUY0anVfWWtjdUk5SVBFMlAteDhlUDFSRlNUSy1lZ3BkNWlfanJrRDNKd0FSRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke is a leading cause of death, but small, consistent habits can reduce your risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easy to focus on what to do by day, but experts say our nighttime habits matter, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They suggest moving more, getting enough sleep and avoiding late meals and alcohol.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s on the rise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, you may be wondering how you can reduce your odds. Part of the answer may lie in your nighttime habits. “It’s the small, consistent habits we do every day that can have a significant impact on reducing our risk of multiple chronic diseases, including heart disease and stroke,” says &lt;a href="https://www.coachsimranmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Simran Malhotra, M.D., DipABLM, CHWC&lt;/a&gt;. “Modifiable risk factors of stroke are things that are in our control, like eating a whole food fiber-rich diet, regular movement, restorative sleep and limiting risky substances like tobacco and alcohol.”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research shows that up to 84% of strokes are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of that means focusing on your 9-to-5. Yet what you do–and don’t do–after hours can also have a lasting impact on your odds. To help you make the most of those evening hours, we reached out to cardiovascular health experts. Here are the key nighttime habits they recommend avoiding to cut your risk of having a stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eating-a-late-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eating a Late Dinner  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating late at night might feel like a normal part of your routine, especially if the day gets away from you. But it could be putting your brain and heart health at risk. “Late meals may disrupt your body’s circadian rhythm and negatively affect blood pressure and metabolism, says &lt;a href="http://www.entirelynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular health. Over time, these disruptions may increase your risk of cardiovascular issues, including stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has found that eating your last meal of the day after 9 P.M. is associated with a higher stroke risk compared to eating dinner earlier. A similar increased risk is linked to eating a late breakfast, suggesting that the timing of both your first and last meals may play a bigger role in stroke risk than previously believed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Making a habit of eating earlier, both in the morning and at night, could support your body’s natural rhythms and protect against stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-lounging-on-the-couch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Lounging on the Couch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After dinner, it can be tempting to park yourself on the couch to relax for the evening, especially after a long day. While rest is important, spending too much time lounging around at night could increase your risk of stroke, particularly if you already sit for long periods during the day. Even if you’re young. For instance, one large&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;study found that physically inactive people under 60 who spent more than eight hours a day watching TV, using the computer or reading were three and a half times more likely to experience a stroke than people who spent less free time in sedentary activities.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is even small amounts of activity can be beneficial. “Taking a 20-minute post-dinner walk can help with digestion while optimizing blood sugar control,” says Malhotra. “This can help with reducing the risk of prediabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure and ultimately heart disease and stroke.” If you’re walking to lower your risk of stroke, picking up the pace can help even more. According to one meta-analysis, every 0.66-mile-per-hour increase in a person’s walking speed was linked to a 13% reduction in stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-sipping-a-nightcap"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Sipping a Nightcap &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your evening wind-down routine includes a glass or two of wine, beer or bourbon, you may be setting the stage for stroke without realizing it. While past research suggests drinking may provide some protection against stroke, more recent evidence challenges that idea. “Alcohol increases inflammation and damages cells,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-alexander-el-md-8b6381152/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Troy Alexander-EL, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; For instance, one of the largest international studies on stroke risk found that moderate and high alcohol intake were linked to a greater risk of stroke. Even downing five or more drinks per day just once a month raised a person's risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the entirety of the evidence, swapping your routine nightcap with an herbal tea or mocktail could be a simple way to reduce your odds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-staying-up-too-late"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Staying Up Too Late &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re burning the midnight oil watching TV, scrolling on your phone or catching up on work, you may be doing more harm than good. “Sleep is the foundational longevity pillar and the most underrated lifestyle habit,” says Malhotra. Research has found both too much or too little sleep can up your risk of stroke. However, sleeping too much may be even more detrimental than not sleeping enough. The proof? One meta-analysis found that people who slept five or fewer hours per night were 33% more likely to experience a stroke. However, those odds rose to 71% in people who slept eight or more hours nightly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since both too little and too much sleep are problematic, getting those nightly eight hours is a good goal. Keeping consistent bed and wake-up times, even on weekends can also be helpful, says Malhotra.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is a leading cause of death, and its numbers are on the rise. While some risk factors, like age and family history, are out of your control, your health habits can go a long way in reducing your odds. Of course, it’s easy to focus on what we do during the day. But what you do–and don’t do–after 5 P.M. can have a surprising impact on your chances of having a stroke, say cardiovascular health experts. To reduce your risk, they recommend skipping that nightcap, spending less time on the couch, avoiding late meals and turning in early. These simple evening choices may sound small, but they can add up to big benefits for your heart and brain health.&lt;br&gt;

A Spanish trial that followed 57,000 adults for a decade now shows that a laboratory stool test performs as well as a full colonoscopy at detecting early disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding supports the view that a quick fecal immunochemical test (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000704.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FIT&lt;/a&gt;) done at home can stand shoulder‑to‑shoulder with the hospital scope when the goal is catching cancer early. The result has lit up social media feeds and could change how doctors explain screening choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study leaders Dr. Antoni Castells of &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/antoni-castells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clínic de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.enriquequintero.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Enrique Quintero&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/sanidad/scs/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of the Canary Islands coordinated the decade‑long &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00619-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colonprev project&lt;/a&gt;, the first randomized comparison of these two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both physicians are veteran gastroenterologists who have spent years urging wider participation in national screening programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team worked with 15 tertiary hospitals across eight Spanish regions, randomly inviting half the participants to a one‑time colonoscopy and the other half to biennial FIT kits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful follow‑up over ten years allowed the researchers to record every &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/y-chromosome-disappearance-study-finds-direct-link-to-much-greater-cancer-risk/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis and related death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-cancer-cases-are-rising"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, doctors expect roughly 107,320 new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/protein-cd74-discovery-may-change-the-treatment-of-colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancers&lt;/a&gt; and 46,950 rectal cancers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers place the disease third among all cancers for incidence and keep it high on the public‑health agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall incidence has fallen about one percent per year in adults over 50 thanks to better screening and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, rates in adults younger than fifty have climbed 2.4 percent annually, highlighting why simple tests that people actually use matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality also remains substantial, with an estimated 52,900 U.S. deaths forecast for 2025, even as older age groups benefit from earlier detection and improved treatment. Every saved life therefore counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colonprev investigators recorded 55 colorectal‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-virus-that-attacks-black-eyed-peas-also-kills-cancer-tumors/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the colonoscopy group and 60 in the FIT group, a difference of just 0.02 percentage points that met their strict non‑inferiority margin of 0.16. Clinically, that means both strategies protect patients equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the stool test achieved this outcome while requiring no bowel prep, sedation, or time off work. Non‑inferiority therefore arrived with far less disruption to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participation in screening was higher among individuals invited to faecal immunochemical test screening than colonoscopy screening,” wrote Dr. Castells. His comment captures why uptake metrics deserve as much attention as raw test accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colonoscopy-screening-is-less-popular"&gt;Colonoscopy screening is less popular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better participation amplifies the impact of any screening program, because an excellent test is useless if few people complete it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health planners often describe this benefit as the difference between efficacy (how well something works in theory) and effectiveness (how well it works in the real world).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier interim &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22356323/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2012, hinted at the same pattern: screening participation was better with FIT while colonoscopy found more benign adenomas without improving &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bats-dont-get-cancer-now-scientists-think-they-know-the-reason/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; mortality at that time. The full ten‑year data confirm that early signal and settle the mortality question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Spanish trial, 39.9 percent of those invited mailed back FIT kits compared with 31.8 percent who scheduled colonoscopies. Similar gaps appear in U.S. insurance &lt;a href="https://ascopost.com/news/october-2022/study-examines-efficacy-cost-of-fit-vs-multitarget-stool-dna-testing-for-colorectal-cancer-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare figures place the average price of an at‑home FIT around $24, whereas a colonoscopy with facility fees often reaches $635 or more. That sticker difference alone can sway both patients and payers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond dollars, convenience matters; the scope requires a clear liquid diet, a potent laxative, transportation, and recovery time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stool card, by contrast, takes minutes in the privacy of one’s bathroom and slips into a prepaid envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, colonoscopy offers an immediate therapeutic edge because doctors can remove suspicious polyps during the same session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive FIT therefore triggers a follow‑up colonoscopy to finish the job, making both tests partners rather than rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4949-colonoscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes that minor side effects like temporary bloating are common, while serious complications such as bleeding or a tear in the bowel wall are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing these risks helps people weigh the comfort of FIT against the one‑and‑done nature of colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-you"&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; advises starting regular screening at age forty‑five and continuing through seventy‑five, with the choice of yearly FIT, colonoscopy every ten years, or several other approved options. Older adults up to eighty‑five may also benefit, depending on overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking a test that fits your lifestyle greatly increases the odds you will stick with the schedule. Many clinics now mail FIT kits directly after a routine visit, and some pharmacies hand them out without an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your clinician how family history, inflammatory bowel disease, or certain genetic syndromes might alter timing or frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a plan is in place, set a reminder, complete the test on time, and encourage friends and relatives to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (&lt;a href="https://fascrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ASCRS&lt;/a&gt;) lists fiber‑rich foods, regular exercise, limited red meat, and quitting tobacco among six clear steps that cut risk. Screening finds problems early, and healthy choices lower the odds those problems ever appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, do not ignore new digestive symptoms between screenings, because even the best schedule cannot replace prompt care when something feels off. Warning signs like rectal bleeding or unexplained weight loss deserve swift attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158525/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 18:54:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNaXp6YmoyNDZUb21PVXk1MDV0WDFiWGtNTlQwNUZvWE5scnFyeUtqQ2lva05QYTBsVlNsWE5YdS1DeU9uWmk0djlMSzhuY0lQX3RRNk5VcnFuUGEtNTlFa2U3eTJBa0hXU196SWhBaTJyNFBIazhIVnV0ZllRSzJwdVNvSzJ5SDI0VzdFQnAtVjh2MG5JRmw4a2poaVFXQllmMXpieXdWNEJiUEd6</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您不应该服用预防癌症的5种补充剂- EatingWell | 5 Supplements You Shouldn’t Take to Prevent Cancer, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE15NE9iWHRmbVdZZTIwdjYwa1h3QlZqVHMzXzRaZldFaTZRa1JJa3FQVmhpYXptUEFPbkdmc21uajUzV0I1MUFJd2JzZ0g4MVNxN3FBZ1JlM01TQWlyeFJZYlBsTTF4OWs0dE1WSXp2N2lVZFp4bjBPd1h6bF9yYTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary supplements shouldn’t be taken to reduce your cancer risk—some may actually increase your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts encourage getting nutrients from food like fruit, veggies and whole grains instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider lifestyle changes like limiting alcohol and getting regular exercise to lower your cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one thing you can take away after reading this article, it’s this: Supplements do not prevent cancer. That’s the stance of the World Cancer Research Fund, which encourages people to get their nutrients from food, not supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Overwhelmingly, studies on supplements rarely pan out,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/patient-family/support-services/nutrition/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hillary Wright, M.Ed., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior oncology dietitian at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In specific situations, supplements may be useful for filling personal gaps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-an-oncologist-has-for-breakfast-11722729" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in one’s diet&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re not useful when it comes to preventing cancer in the future, says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the pull to pop is understandable. “It can be easier to take a pill than think about how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet,” says Wright. Let’s address five supplements that have been suggested to help prevent cancer and what you should do instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-beta-carotene"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Beta Carotene &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beta carotene is an antioxidant plant pigment that’s part of the carotenoid family.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Antioxidants are substances that neutralize cell-damaging free radicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Your body converts &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-a-than-carrot-11690733" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beta carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be found in produce like carrots, dark leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes and cantaloupe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The interest in beta carotene came from the observation that people who eat more fruits and vegetables seem to get less lung cancer. However, beta carotene is one singular component of countless compounds that someone’s body is exposed to if they eat more fruits and vegetables,” Wright explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When research was done on beta carotene supplements, scientists learned that people who smoke and take beta carotene get more lung cancer, and the research had to be terminated, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wright adds, “From a nutritionist standpoint, it’s not surprising that when we cherry-pick a particular nutrient and take it in high doses that don’t occur in nature, there may be unintended consequences.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is another antioxidant vitamin that has had a long history of being linked to immune system support. “There’s been an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; ‘boosting’ the immune system for decades. I haven’t read any science that backs that up across the board,” says Wright. “There is a lack of evidence suggesting that we should take daily supplemental vitamin C.” (It’s a water-soluble vitamin, so you typically urinate the excess, and there’s less of a safety risk compared to other supplements like beta carotene.&lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/research-policy/evidence-for-our-recommendations/supplements/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) That said, eating foods high in vitamin C is a good idea—and in fact, a C-rich diet has been associated with a lower incidence of several cancers, including breast, cervical, endometrial, esophageal, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like beta carotene, taking vitamin E may cause more problems than it solves. It’s an antioxidant, which is why vitamin E supplements have been linked to cancer prevention. Although there have been studies done on the effects of vitamin E supplements on some cancers, the results have been mixed. Disappointingly, there is not enough evidence that taking vitamin E will help you prevent cancer, and it can increase your risk of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer, when consumed in large doses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is considered a hormone that improves calcium absorption in the gut and affects bone formation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We get&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from the food we eat (such as dairy), and our skin produces the vitamin in response to sun exposure. There is no doubt that adequate vitamin D is incredibly important for overall health. “We have vitamin D receptors in almost every cell in our body—but this doesn’t mean that people need to be super vitamin D’d,” says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cancer, while there is evidence that D may inhibit the growth of cancer cells in animal models, there is no data to suggest that this decreases the risk of cancer in humans.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430526/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you suspect your levels of D are inadequate (a frequent occurrence in the winter months for those in more northern climates), talk to your health care provider about being tested for vitamin D and if a supplement is right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium is a key nutrient for bone health, muscle and nerve function, and blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In some instances, your health care provider may recommend supplemental doses if you are at risk for calcium deficiency due to your health or diet. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess intake of calcium&lt;/a&gt;—more than 1,000 milligrams from supplements daily—is associated with a 53% increased risk of cancer mortality, research has found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Calcium from food was found to be safe.) It’s not yet clear why excess supplemental calcium may have this detrimental impact, but the amount of calcium absorbed by the body may differ when it comes from food versus supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-cancer-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cancer prevention isn’t found in a pill. “Overwhelmingly, diet and lifestyle strategies show the most promise for reducing cancer risk and supporting survivorship,” says Wright. According to the WCRF, 40% of cancer cases are preventable.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The following is an evidence-backed list of five of the WCRF’s recommendations to prevent cancer:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: &lt;/strong&gt;Overweight and obesity can lead to chronic inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones, which may lead to cancer. The more weight a person carries and the longer they do, the greater the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be physically active: &lt;/strong&gt;Getting regular exercise can help manage your weight. Adults should aim for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables (including beans) and fruits contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and other plant compounds that may help prevent cancer. These foods, in addition to whole grains, may also reduce the risk of cancer by supporting a healthy weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit fast foods, red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;The science is clear on the connection between increased cancer risk (especially colorectal cancer) and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt;. Red and processed meat may also play a role in increasing the risk of breast cancer and some forms of prostate cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and don’t smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking can increase your risk for certain types of cancer, like throat, colon, rectum, breast and liver. Stay within the guidelines for alcohol (two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women). Smoking is responsible for 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths, but it also raises your risk for many cancers, including bladder, blood, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary supplements should not be taken to reduce your cancer risk. While many are probably completely ineffective (creating only expensive urine), some supplements have been shown to paradoxically &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; your risk of cancer. That includes high intakes of antioxidant supplements, most notably beta carotene. Consuming nutrients through a healthy, balanced diet is safe and healthy. Plus, a diet that focuses on plant-based foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes has been shown to be protective against cancers. If you need to take a supplement due to a health condition or dietary need, follow your health care provider’s recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozempic-like drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity may also treat migraine, even when the medications don't trigger weight loss, early research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preliminary report, published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14991" target="_blank" data-url="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14991" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Headache&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and presented June 21 at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) conference, suggests that liraglutide — a drug used to treat obesity and diabetes — slashed the number of days patients experienced severe migraines by almost half. Liraglutide belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes semaglutide, the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the idea of treating migraines with these drugs is "extremely innovative and forward-thinking," the new results should be taken with caution. That's because the trial was small and didn't include a comparison group that didn't use the medication, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/sinclair-alexandra" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/sinclair-alexandra" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Alex Sinclair&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an absolutely tantalizing research study because it gives us a really interesting idea of a new mechanism of delivering drugs for migraine," Sinclair told Live Science. "But it is very preliminary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "very important and exciting finding" could potentially provide "another treatment option for patients with chronic migraine, especially for those who did not previously respond to other current available treatments," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chiang-chia-chun-m-d/bio-20146997" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chiang-chia-chun-m-d/bio-20146997" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chia-Chun Chiang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="migraine-days-cut-in-half-3"&gt;Migraine days cut in half &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the effect of liraglutide on migraine, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vjneurology.com/video/q21ihlx0-u0-a-pilot-prospective-observational-study-exploring-glp-1r-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-migraine/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.vjneurology.com/video/q21ihlx0-u0-a-pilot-prospective-observational-study-exploring-glp-1r-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-migraine/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Simone Braca&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, and colleagues gave 31 patients with obesity and high-frequency or chronic migraine 0.6 milligrams of liraglutide daily for one week, followed by 1.2 mg daily for the next 11 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, nearly half of the patients reported that their number of headache days per month had dropped, from an average of 20 to nine. This was a "huge" effect, Braca told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven people saw their headache days drop by 75%, and one patient's migraines disappeared completely. Overall, the patients also reported a large drop in how much migraine impeded their daily lives. Importantly, the participants did not shed weight during the study. This suggests the improvement in migraine wasn't linked to weight loss, a noteworthy observation since obesity is known to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-obesity/" target="_blank" data-url="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-obesity/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of severe headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/can-weight-loss-drugs-help-you-drink-less-alcohol" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/can-weight-loss-drugs-help-you-drink-less-alcohol"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can weight loss drugs help you drink less alcohol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braca highlighted that these patients had been selected because they had not responded to other migraine drugs, such as antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a molecule released in the brain during a migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors have some theories about what might be happening, but they didn't collect measurements that could prove a mechanism of action. GLP-1 drugs may reduce pressure inside the skull by lowering the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain and spinal cord, the researchers suggested. This, in turn, could reduce the release of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835001/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835001/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CGRP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which many scientists think fuels migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of that hypothesis, Braca's team pointed to a previous study led by Sinclair and published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151178/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151178/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. It suggested that exenatide, another GLP-1 drug, lowers brain pressure. Of note the drug seemed to reduce migraine days among the study participants, although it was unable to show a strong statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible mechanisms underpinning the effect in the new study results could be that liraglutide directly reduced the release of CGRP or that the drug regulated glucose metabolism, Chiang said. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/247255" target="_blank" data-url="https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/247255" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that migraine could be linked to issues in glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has important limitations, though, Sinclair said. First, the study was very small, with only 31 participants, and it lasted only 12 weeks. Another significant limitation is that the trial did not include a placebo group. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;placebo effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by which people's symptoms improve even with a sham treatment, is particularly strong when it comes to self-reported pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a big placebo response in headache research," Sinclair told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braca agreed that the trial had limitations. Still, "both the history of multiple previous treatment failures and the magnitude of the observed response reduce the likelihood of a significant placebo effect," Braca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results now need to be confirmed in larger, placebo-controlled clinical trials before they could guide treatment for patients with migraine. If confirmed, however, the findings could open up a new line of inquiry for migraine treatment, Braca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn-nOdiYlBY8fkJj3c93CLCelCIOX1whNtp" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn-nOdiYlBY8fkJj3c93CLCelCIOX1whNtp slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Health professionals have long used body mass index as a quick screening tool to fast-track certain patients into a "code red" management plan — people whose weight puts them in danger of future health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is that BMI measures health risk by calculating height and weight. However, muscle and bone weigh more than fat, so BMI measurements can overestimate the danger for people with a muscular build or a larger frame. Conversely, BMI can underestimate health concerns in older adults and anyone who has lost muscle, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, authors of a new study say a different approach to weight measurement may be a more accurate way to predict future health issues. Bioelectrical impedance analysis, or BIA, uses undetectable electric currents to measure not only the percentage of body fat but also lean muscle mass and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works like this: You stand on metal plates on the machine while holding your hands or thumbs on another metal attachment held away from the body. Once started, the machine sends a weak electrical current through the body. Body fat, muscle and bone all have different electrical conductivity, so the machine uses algorithms to determine lean muscle mass, body fat percentage and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found body-fat percentage to be a stronger predictor of 15-year mortality risk in adults between the ages of 20 and 49 than BMI," said Arch Mainous III, lead author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Family Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to deaths from heart disease, people with high body fat as measured by BIA were 262% times more likely to die than people who had a healthy percentage of body fat, said Mainous, a professor and vice chair of research in community health and family medicine at the University of Florida School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now remember, using BMI did not flag any risk at all in this younger population, which isn't one we typically consider to be at high risk for heart disease," said senior author Dr. Frank Orlando, a clinical associate professor of community health and family medicine at University of Florida Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of the interventions we can do to keep them healthy when we know this early. I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with BMI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI is measured by dividing your weight by the square of your height. (If you are mathematically challenged like I am, the National Institutes of Health has a free calculator.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BMI world, a body mass between 18.5 and 24.9 is a healthy weight, between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, between 30 and 34.9 is obese, between 35 and 39.9 is class 2 obesity, and anything greater than 40 is "severe" or class 3 obesity. People are considered underweight if their BMI is lower than 18.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using BMI to measure health risk works — on a population level. Countless studies have shown that a greater BMI really does correlate with developing chronic diseases of all kinds — cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney and liver disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where BMI fails is at the patient level. Imagine a patient who is "skinny fat" — thin on the outside but riddled with globs of fat wrapped around major organs on the inside. Your BMI would be fine even though your health was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those people are more likely to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, more likely to have elevated glucose, more likely to have elevated blood pressure, and more likely to have inflammation in general," Mainous said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these health issues can be treated, stopped and in some cases even reversed if caught early enough, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Frank Orlando, clinical associate professor at University of Florida Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors are aware of the issues with BMI, many prefer it "because it is cheap and easily put into practice," Mainous said. "They'd like to use a more direct measurement such as a DEXA scan, but those cost too much and are not widely available, so everyone falls back to the indirect measure of BMI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEXA stands for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and is the gold standard for body mass analysis. Such machines can cost between $45,000 and $80,000, so patients typically travel to a hospital or specialty center to get the scan, Orlando said. The cost to the patient can easily be $400 to $500 per scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we found the newer versions of bioelectrical impedance are pretty accurate, giving some valid and reliable results," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One note — at-home based bioelectrical impedance products are not nearly as accurate, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can be affected a lot by how much body fluid you have, how hydrated you are," said Freeman, who was not involved with the new research. "At-home measurements will only give a ballpark — the clinic-based machines are more precise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it time for doctors to embrace body fat measurements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed data on 4,252 men and women who participated in the 1999 to 2004 federal survey called NHANES, or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a yearly checkup of the nation's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technicians measured each person's body composition, including height, weight and waist circumference. In addition, all participants underwent a clinic-based bioelectrical impedance analysis, which measures the body's resistance to electrical currents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the National Death Index through 2019 to see how many people died. After adjusting for age, race and poverty status, the study found a BMI that labeled someone as obese was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of death from any cause, when compared with those in healthy BMI range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high body fat as measured by bioimpedance analysis, however, were 78% more likely to die from any cause, Mainous said. Measuring waist circumference was also helpful, but not as accurate as body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add that to the 262% higher chance of dying from heart disease found by the study, and it's a no-brainer for doctors to use bioelectrical impedance analysis on patients, Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There have been studies discussing the effects of caffeine on sleep and for me as someone who &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; drink coffee, it’s all about the timing of when the caffeine gets into your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can get jitters and hyperactivity after just one sip, but for others, like myself, that doesn’t happen. The half-life of coffee is five to six hours so it’s important to be aware of when you’re drinking it, the effects it can have and how long these effects last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we should stop drinking coffee by 2pm to really allow most of that caffeine to get out of your system by the time you go to bed at 11pm. Drinking coffee late in the afternoon can delay sleepiness or can disrupt sleep and make you more restless. How sensitive you are to caffeine varies between people, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;6pm: start winding down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to make sure I have time to wind down during the evening and allow my mind and body to step away and focus on something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, that’s doing some meditation, breath work, an evening walk, listening to a podcast or watching something on TV. It is better to watch something on a TV, rather than a laptop or phone because the screen’s further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;7pm: dinner time (and be mindful of lighting)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eat quite healthily and aim to have a plateful of mostly pulses and vegetables. After dinner I try not to turn on the lights. It’s easier right now because it’s summer, but still in the winter I prefer to keep the lights dim to minimise any alerting signal so I’m ready for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In winter, I think we need to be mindful of electric lighting as a primary source. Be mindful of how bright that light is in the evening and then consider a sunlight alarm clock to wake yourself up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to engage in non-stimulating activity to allow the mind and brain time to process. If I work right until I go to bed, my mind would be full and it would be hard to sleep because my mind would be full of what I just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;10pm: read in bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll get into bed and read for about 10 minutes, and turn the light off at 10.15pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can’t fall asleep I reflect on why that might be – is my mind busy? Are my thoughts just going round and round? I try to shift my attention to my breath if I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with a lot of women in midlife to improve their sleep and the one thing they struggle with most is waking up in the middle of the night. Hormonal fluctuations, hot flushes and worry can all play a part in disrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worry is a big one – this might be about falling back asleep, the lack of sleep or performance. All of this can have a negative impact on the quality of sleep we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wake up in the middle of the night, the first thing I do is ask myself what’s going on. Am I too hot? Has a thought grabbed my attention? Is this thought going to be helpful to me right now at three in the morning? Is there anything I can do about this thought right now? In most instances, I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I definitely have days where I don’t sleep well and feel tired the next day. If I have three big glasses of wine, I’ll often wake up in the night and struggle to get back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, it’s important to give yourself grace after a poor night’s sleep. Remind yourself why your sleep might have been affected the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can say to yourself, yes, I was at an occasion and I had more alcohol than usual – it’s not what I usually do, but tonight I’ll go to bed a bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Nicole Collins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Katharina Lederle appears on QVC as the sleep expert for their show, Menopause Your Way and offers one to one client work on her website &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://drkatsleep.com/"&gt;Dr Kat Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Exercise modulates inflammatory pathways, reducing markers like CRP and IL-6.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotection:&lt;/strong&gt; “Physical activity increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), supporting neuronal health and cognitive function, essential for reducing dementia risk and maintaining mental acuity,” Patel says. Translation: it’s good for your brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can exercise ever be harmful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all finished a run and felt like an eighty-year-old whose knees and lungs are crumbling. Is that still an indicator of health? There’s a joke among some athletes—particularly climbers—that your chosen sport advances you ahead of other people. Not in fitness, but in age, with wrists, backs, ankles, elbows all feeling the strain of repetitive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a paradox,” says Patel. “Exercise itself triggers inflammation, and chronic inflammation is a fast-track to aging.” The key is to find the Goldilocks spot—the just-right amount that stimulates adaptation without excessive wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is meant to cause some muscle damage. It’s how we get stronger, and inflammation is the process by which the damaged areas are sent all of the building materials they need to repair themselves and are protected while this happens. But you’ve probably heard that inflammation is bad, leading to all sorts of worrying things, including cancer. So what’s the solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you know if you’re hitting the Goldilocks zone?” asks Patel. There are a few ways. You can get a kit to track your biological age, and dial back your workouts if the results are concerning. You can also track heart rate variability, with low HRV indicating poor recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/vo2-max-1"&gt;Tracking your VO2 Max&lt;/a&gt;—a test of the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise—works in the same way. Patel calls it “the ultimate predictor of longevity, indicating cardiorespiratory fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your levels in any of these tests are higher than you’d like, scale it back. For best results, you might work with a physiologist to find out what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whittaker has a final hack: sleep. “It’s the most important recovery tool by a country mile,” he says, above and beyond cold plunges, red light therapy, Theraguns and all the other trendy gadgets and hacks. Feeling sore? Sometimes, a good night’s rest is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I become more active in daily life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting the gym or the running track a few times a week is great, and will have huge benefits for your well-being and chances of living a long life. But moving more isn’t just about doing so in siloed time slots. You’ll also want to move more throughout the day. Koch has some recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit time being sedentary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Consider using a standing desk or exercise ball to replace your chair and regular ‘movement snacks’ to reduce the long hours sitting at a desk everyday,” Koch suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 16:55:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBsQmxHaGIyak9Cdm5wV29fYUdNQ1AxdzFlVEZDU1p5dGZObWxIdXZ0YW8xNHVjT3Zwa1dwUW02Z0doY2lwUUhyaXc4RWZPM1BDUmZJZnctMV91cm0wZ19J</guid></item><item><title>当我性高潮时，会发生一些非常奇怪的事情。让它停下来。- Slate Magazine | Something Really Strange Happens When I Orgasm.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hugs001i3b76xyr0opqa@published"&gt;I’m a guy. When I masturbate, and I start to orgasm, suddenly my brain kicks into high gear. I start to think about the quality of the orgasm, reconstructing what I did to make it great or not great, and wondering why I’m thinking about these things. Then I start to think about a problem at work I need to solve, what I’m doing for the weekend, and so on, even while I’m still feeling it. Why does this happen? Does some chemical get released in my brain that supercharges my logical side?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hupq001l3b76ja8kn2sn@published"&gt;Straight up, I cannot tell you for sure what this is. It isn’t widely reported enough to be able to say for certain (and if it were, you probably wouldn’t even have to ask). I will offer a potential explanation below that could lead to action on your part in terms of curbing this, though you should determine for yourself whether or not this is something you want to change. From your description, it doesn’t seem to disturb you too much, so the rest of this question may amount to much ado about nothing. Sometimes our thoughts race, no big deal! But if you’re interested in potentially not going through the post-orgasm, high-gear brain, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7husj001m3b76orwn1bz9@published"&gt;One group that does report a similar-sounding phenomenon is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qu1m05/does_anyone_else_experience_intrusive_thoughts/"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;. Do you think it’s fair to call these thoughts “intrusive?” They certainly seem unwelcome and some (particularly those regarding the orgasm you’re having) may qualify as obsessive. Perhaps you have noticed other times in your life when similar thinking manifests, but even if not, it could be somehow related to OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7huxh001n3b762zynrifq@published"&gt;OCD is “one of the most misdiagnosed disorders,” according to psychologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.monnicawilliams.com/about.php"&gt;Monnica Williams&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Obsessions-Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder-Step/dp/0190624795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Step-by-Step, Definitive Guide to Understanding, Diagnosis, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “People with OCD can get stuck on anything,” Williams told me when I reached her by phone to discuss your question. “It’s not just germs, not just lining up things on your desk.” The diffuse array of OCD’s presentations can be challenging to clinicians. “We know from research that we’ve done surveying psychologists and counselors that unless it shows up in these very stereotypical ways, it’s often missed,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv0v001o3b76h46sc7ec@published"&gt;Williams said that what you describe &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be OCD, but again, this is not a diagnosis—it’s a suggestion for future inquiry on your part, should you be interested in taking it up. Williams said that people with OCD generally “tend to focus on things that are most important to them or central to their identity.” If sex is particularly important to a person, “it could certainly happen that the OCD would tend to strike in that area,” said Williams. Certain events can be more triggering than others, so if you’re only experiencing the intrusive thoughts during orgasm, it could still be a sign of OCD. And, if what’s happening is OCD-related, your brain during these moments could indeed qualify as “supercharged,” “in that you can look at a person’s brain with a PET scan and you can see the increased activity in some of the circuits that are responsible for OCD,” explained Williams. “The brain is in overdrive when a person has OCD. But, I don’t know if I would necessarily correlate that with logic per se,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv5q001p3b76nh63csy6@published"&gt;Identifying whether this is OCD or not is important because if it is, there are clinical methods to treat it—namely exposure and ritual prevention, according to Williams. In the event that Williams had a patient who reported what you did, she would suggest the following treatment: “What I might do is say, ‘OK, when you masturbate afterwards, instead of thinking about the quality of the orgasm, you’re gonna say to yourself: That orgasm was shit—oh, well. And move on. And in that way, you’re doing kind of the opposite of what your pattern had been. And that’s how you break the cycle.” Mindfulness can help facilitate this, as it can help you gain awareness of your thoughts and your ability to change course. Even if you don’t pursue OCD treatment, I suggest you start practicing mindfulness (see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/wife-secret-sex-toy-advice-tracking.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for some general background). It may make intervening more easy when your mind starts racing.&lt;/p&gt;

Williams is the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.ocdtypes.com/"&gt;New England OCD Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which may be worth checking out as well—the website offers a self-test that you may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

I know women get fisted, but let’s face it—vaginas can handle babies. The backdoor wasn’t built for that. Is what my boyfriend wants to do safe or possible for a gay couple?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvpp001v3b76pjrv9azf@published"&gt;Yes, Virginia, there are men who get fisted. For some, this is a special occasional treat and for others, it’s a Tuesday night. The gay community contains multitudes and a dude with a hand up his ass is never too far away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvsr001w3b76mrfay2wb@published"&gt;Is fisting safe? It can be if done properly, but it comes with risks in both the long and short term. For a &lt;a href="http://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/boyfriend-pushing-it-advice.html"&gt;previous column&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist Carlton Thomas (known on social media as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/doctorcarlton/?hl=en"&gt;@DoctorCarlton&lt;/a&gt;) told me that most of the long-term consequences of fisting are a result of injuries—getting permanently stretched out is a lesser concern, because of what Thomas refers to as the anus’s “incredible snapback,” though it is possible. Said injuries can include bleeding, tearing, and hemorrhoids, &lt;a href="https://bespokesurgical.com/2024/11/14/anal-fisting-guide/"&gt;according to anal surgeon Evan Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;. Stephen Goldstone’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ins-Outs-Gay-Sex-Handbook/dp/0440508460"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex: A Medical Handbook for Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big toys or fisting can be dangerous. Any stiff, long object may not negotiate the natural bend in your colon and tear through the wall—an extremely dangerous situation that requires emergency surgery to repair. Thick toys (especially fists) can damage your sphincter muscle and may eventually lead to an inability to control your bowels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw0e001y3b76nxcb65hx@published"&gt;And as with other anal play, pain is a distinct possibility, as is the transmission of STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="202" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw2l001z3b76ye3eezh5@published"&gt;There are guys who absolutely love fisting and find connectedness through the act, in spite (and in some cases because) of the risks. More potential danger yields more vulnerability. That said, this is not really beginner play and the intensity alone makes it something that you should only try if you really want it. “This doesn’t sound like a good idea,” isn’t convincing me that you’re a good candidate to get fisted. One of Thomas’s tips is to get fisted by an experienced fister, who can serve as a guide and hopefully troubleshoot in the moment. I’m not sure if your boyfriend qualifies but if you really want to dabble, I suggest bringing in a fisting top who can show both of you the ropes. He should be communicative, use lots of lube, and offer a covering for his fist (like a &lt;a href="https://www.mysextoyguide.com/best-fisting-gloves/"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt;) which can help smooth the texture. You almost certainly won’t be able to take a whole fist the first time you try (progressive dilation is key), so someone with the knowledge of this and attendant patience would also be essential. You can vet him ahead of time to see just how much of this he already knows and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyof003c3b76rqkpwjvg@published"&gt;A month ago my husband and I spent a week at my sister’s home out of state. The trouble is we left a cock ring behind. I went through our suitcases more than a dozen times without finding it. We brought it with us, so I’m certain it must have been lost there. She hasn’t contacted us to let us know she found it or mentioned it in the time we’ve spoken since the visit. It has sentimental value, but I’m embarrassed as hell to ask if she came across it. My husband says to grow up: We’re all adults, my sister knows what sex is, and to just ask her already. Is he right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003f3b76mrw33hee@published"&gt;Firstly, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the idea of attaching sentimental value to a cock ring. It’s like a grown-up &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Call it &lt;em&gt;Sex Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine what all the sex toys get up to when you aren’t looking! Imagine how their existential grief intermingles with stigma-fueled shame when their owner wants to throw them away! After all, there’s no Goodwill section for sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t remember but I feel like no—those movies, in my recollection, have consistently perpetuated the deep ties that we have to inanimate objects. With all due respect to those who find themselves sexually attracted to or even in love with said objects, if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get over this, it’s probably easier just to get a new cock ring. They are plentiful. That way you could avoid having the conversation with your sister entirely, since the prospect of it vexes you so.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003h3b76h5vm7ljt@published"&gt;Otherwise, I side with your husband. Just ask. You don’t have to refer to it as a cock ring. Be vague and call it jewelry or a ring. Lie and say it’s a bandanna ring or a napkin ring. Tell her it’s a bangle for your doll’s arm. Obfuscate entirely: “We left something behind.” Or straight-up tell her it’s a cock ring. Decide what terminology is least uncomfortable for you and go with it. You’re both adults. This may be awkward and it may represent a new discursive frontier if you and your sister don’t typically discuss sex, but she shouldn’t hold your sexuality against you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7llp8003v3b76z6xjfet8@published"&gt;I would really love a boyfriend, and I’m particularly attracted to big, beefy men. The problem is, I’m truly scared of them. I often have dreams about being assaulted by a man, and the bigger, beefier ones are more dangerous-seeming than the littler guys. Because of this, I’m thinking of dating less “masculine” guys, but that’s not actually what I’m attracted to. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/muscular-men-fear-sex-advice.html"&gt;Can you please help me figure out what to do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I've had an ECG but this didn't reveal anything abnormal. Do I need treatment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Palpitations involve the heart racing or beating abnormally. Some people may notice a thumping or feel an irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes this is accompanied by breathlessness or the need to cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Palpitations can be triggered by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-7b6490e0-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, strenuous exercise, a lack of sleep, stress, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-7b62bc20-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, nicotine and certain medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While uncomfortable, palpitations caused by one of these factors are not dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, heart palpitations can also be a sign of a potentially worrying heart rhythm condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, atrial fibrillation triggers an unsteady heartbeat and is caused by a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation also often leads to chest pain, difficulty exercising and shortness of breath. There are medicines that can control the rate and rhythm of the heart, such as beta blockers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation patients may also need surgery to manage the problem. In order to spot the cause of palpitations, patients are often told to wear a device called an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures heart rhythm, for as long as five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because, for some patients, palpitations may occur only occasionally, making them difficult to pick up on a quick test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who continue to have palpitations with no clear cause should ask their GP for further tests in order to find the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is important to remember that all conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;I'm 64 and recently found out my new partner is &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-9ec09720-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" class=""&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; positive. I want to get tested but my GP is also my neighbour, and I'm embarrassed to talk to her about my sex life. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; If personal relationships with a GP make it difficult to seek medical advice, registering with a different practice may be the most appropriate option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some people understandably feel uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics with someone they know socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In such cases, switching GP practices is straightforward and can be done via the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-9ec61560-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; website:&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp"&gt; nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV – human papillomavirus – is a very common viral infection, typically passed on through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around eight in ten people will contract it at some point and, in most cases, it is harmless. However, in rare instances it can lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the primary cause of cervical cancer, which is why NHS cervical screening &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7912671/Cervical-cancer-rates-steep-rise-women-late-20s-charity-warns.html" class=""&gt;includes HPV testing for women aged 25 to 64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over this age are not routinely screened, as evidence suggests that a new HPV infection at this age is unlikely to progress to cervical cancer. This is because cancerous changes in the cervix usually take decades to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those over 65 who missed their final cervical screening, an HPV test can still be requested. The most reliable way to access this is through a sexual health clinic, as not all GP surgeries offer the test, whereas all NHS sexual health services do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-8e21c9d0-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Can't focus? You may lack iron&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm concerned that many people do not know the signs of an iron deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A friend of mine recently went to donate blood and was turned away because a quick test revealed she was anaemic – meaning she has low levels of the crucial nutrient iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had no idea, and many of my patients are surprised to find out they have anaemia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body needs iron to transport oxygen to the organs. Without enough of it, it can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches and heart palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some sufferers also struggle to concentrate. The problem is more common among women. It's also linked to poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is easily treated, by changing diet or taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you found out that you have anaemia? Did it affect your focus? Please use the email address on the right to let me know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;My knees are weak. They aren't sore or inflamed, but when I crouch down I can't get up unless I push off the floor with my hands. What could be the reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Weakness in the legs is unlikely to be caused by an issue with the knees. Instead, there's a greater chance that it's due to problems in the surrounding muscles. Knee problems, like arthritis, tend to trigger pain in the joint or visible swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later life, many people develop a condition called sarcopenia. This is where the muscles slowly reduce in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to combat sarcopenia is to undertake strength-training exercises. These include lifting weights, using exercise bands and doing squats and lunges. These exercises are proven to build and maintain strong muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is different to cardiovascular exercise, such as running or swimming, which is also good for the body but won't necessarily fend off sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees are primarily supported by the quadricep muscles, also known as the quads, which make up the front of the thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone struggling with strength in this area of the body might benefit from a few sessions with a physiotherapist or personal trainer who can teach you some exercises that might help. Any sudden and severe muscle weakness should be investigated by a GP as it can be a sign of disease, such as an autoimmune condition like thyroid disease or lupus. A GP can run blood tests to rule out these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle weakness can also sometimes be a side effect of certain medications such as statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-6c571f80-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;It'll be a long wait for NHS weight-loss jabs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week as it was announced that GPs could start &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13492567/UK-health-chiefs-weight-loss-U-turn-NHS-watchdog-gives-green-light-King-Kong-slimming-jab-Mounjaro-year-refusing-approve-it.html"&gt;prescribing the weight-loss drug Mounjaro on the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, I was not impressed by the way it was handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting claimed it could 'end the obesity epidemic' and the jabs would be available to 'everyone who needs them'. This does not reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can be prescribed weight-loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can get them on the NHS. The day after the announcement my practice was swamped with patients asking for a Mounjaro prescription. None of them qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the restrictions will be eased over time, most people who want these jabs will have to wait a very long time before they can get them on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you tried to get an NHS Mounjaro prescription?

Novelty challenges the brain. Learning something new, such as a language or musical instrument, forces the brain to process and store new information. This practice will create fresh neural pathways. A 2014&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;in older adults found that learning a new and cognitively demanding skill, such as quilting or photography, boosted their memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, another 2019&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6868000/" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;found that bilingualism, the ability to speak two languages, significantly increases and strengthens the connectivity between different areas in the brain. This can delay and decrease the risk of Alzheimer's and several other forms of dementia. You can seek the help of language training apps or enroll in a course, or pick up an instrument.

When the brain strays from this delicate balance, cognitive performance weakens, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s may begin to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed that tau protein buildup in Alzheimer’s disrupts criticality, while sleep appears to restore it, offering potential new therapeutic pathways. With tools like fMRI, this theory may lead to earlier diagnoses and personalized interventions to maintain or restore brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Defined:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain operates best at a near-chaotic tipping point known as criticality, essential for learning and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s may degrade cognition by disrupting the brain’s ability to maintain criticality, not just killing neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep restores the brain’s criticality, suggesting new ways to prevent or slow neurodegeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new paper with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders, Keith Hengen, an associate professor of biology in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, suggests a new comprehensive approach to understanding how the brain works and the rules it must follow to reach optimal performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a common perception that the human brain is the most complicated thing in the universe,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is immensely powerful, but that power may arise from a relatively simple set of mathematical principles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen starts with the premise that almost everything our brains do is learned or powerfully shaped by experience. In other words, we aren’t born with hard-wired circuits preprogrammed to help us read, drive cars or do anything else that we do every day. A healthy brain must be ready to learn anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how is a collection of neurons capable of learning? Hengen suggests that brains become learning machines only when they reach a special state called “criticality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concept borrowed from physics, criticality describes a complex system that is at the tipping point between order and chaos. At this razor’s edge, brains are primed to gain new information, Hengen said. “Brains need to reach criticality to think, remember and learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen proposed criticality as a unifying theory of brain function and disease in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodrow Shew, a physicist at the University of Arkansas, is the co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biologist and a physicist may seem like an odd pairing, but the new unifying theory blends both realms of science. Physicists often describe criticality using the classic example of a sand pile: As sand is added, the pile will grow steeper and steeper until it eventually avalanches. Right before that final grain triggered a moment of chaos, the pile was at a critical angle, one step away from instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shew explained that physicists first developed a deep understanding of criticality as a way to describe magnets and other materials. Around the turn of the 21st century, these ideas were expanded to explain a broader range of complex systems, including avalanches, earthquakes and, ultimately, living systems and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defining aspect of critical systems is that they look the same at any scale: A sand pile on the brink of an avalanche has the same slope whether the pile is tiny or mountainous. In the brain, criticality is constant whether it’s measured in a handful of neurons or an entire region. Likewise, brain patterns that unfold in time are startlingly similar when considered in milliseconds or hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This matches our intuitive understanding of how brains work,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our internal experiences span milliseconds to months. They don’t have a scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen and Shew suggest that criticality isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a state that can be precisely measured and calculated through fMRI brain imaging technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Criticality is the optimal computational state of the brain,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve developed a mathematical way to measure how close the brain is to criticality, which should help us nail down the fundamental questions about how a human brain works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A new understanding of disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticality framework offers a new perspective for understanding neurological disease. Rather than focusing on specific damaged brain regions or accumulated proteins, Hengen argues that diseases such as Alzheimer’s destroy something more basic: the brain’s ability to maintain criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases don’t just damage neurons, they break the brain’s general ability to compute by slowly dissolving criticality,” Hengen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a brain moves further and further from criticality, it loses the ability to adapt and process information effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framework explains a puzzling feature of brain diseases: Patients often appear completely normal until they’ve lost many neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain has remarkable compensatory abilities that can mask functional problems even as criticality begins to erode,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditional assessments miss the early stages because they focus on established endpoints that the brain tries to maintain through workarounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As criticality gradually deteriorates, the brain works harder to achieve the same cognitive outcomes, Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like an engine that still runs but requires more fuel and generates more heat. By the time we notice memory problems or other symptoms, criticality has likely been compromised for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen’s collaboration with David M. Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor at WashU Medicine, has revealed that tau protein buildup in Alzheimer’s directly disrupts criticality, providing a clear link between the disease’s molecular hallmarks and cognitive collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between criticality and Alzheimer’s opens exciting diagnostic possibilities. In theory, a simple fMRI could help detect breakdowns in criticality years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In combination with cutting-edge blood tests, we could identify people at risk and intervene before irreversible damage occurs,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another collaboration, Hengen has teamed up with Deanna Barch, the Gregory B. Couch Professor of Psychiatry at WashU Medicine and a professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences, for an observational study to see how criticality at birth determines cognitive development and abilities in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the beginning, some kids are closer to criticality than others, which, based on our theory, suggests they are going to be better learners,” Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many outside factors can affect their success in school, but criticality can explain an impressive amount of the variability between children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The sleep-mind connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, Hengen and co-author Ralf Wessel, a professor of physics in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at WashU, used the concept of criticality to revisit an age-old question: Why do we need sleep? By tracking brain activity over multiple weeks, they found that sleep restores a state of criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being awake and active moves us away from criticality, and sleep is like a reset button,” Hengen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could help researchers unlock the power of sleep as a therapy for Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases that push the brain away from its optimal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies by Holtzman and others have found that people who don’t get the sleep they need — perhaps due to shift work or chronic insomnia — are at a much higher risk for Alzheimer’s as they age. And there’s already some evidence that sleep interventions can help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hengen believes that targeted, intensive sleep-based therapy could help restore criticality and improve learning and memory in people with brain disease. Studies of mice conducted by Holtzman and James McGregor, a postdoctoral researcher in Hengen’s lab, offer a glimpse of the possibilities: Mice specifically bred to have symptoms of Alzheimer’s become faster learners after a targeted sleep intervention reinforces criticality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Critical future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is much work to be done, but Hengen would eventually like to understand how criticality helps explain complex features of human neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may find that someone who is an amazing artist, for example, might be extremely close to criticality in parts of the brain involved in creative ideation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that a close look at criticality could point to undiscovered tendencies or talents that just need an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they never tried art, but we can see that the potential is there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Hengen, Shew, and others are spreading the word about the importance of criticality. Hengen presented a TEDx talk on the subject in 2024 and shared his work at Arts &amp;amp; Sciences’ inaugural research pitch competition, where he took second place. He hopes the new Neuron paper will inspire conversations among neurologists, doctors, reporters and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unified theory of the mind could change the world, but first, it must unify the experts. “Woody (Shew) and I really think we’re on to something here,” Hengen said. “And, perhaps slowly, others are starting to agree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WashU was the ideal place for a new concept of the brain to emerge, Hengen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re surrounded by brilliant people in diverse fields, including physics, biology, psychology, mathematics and neuroscience, and the community here is remarkably supportive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is ready to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory, learning, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e5f0fdf8f0bffef6fdf8fee3f4d1e6e4e2e5fdbff4f5e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Talia Ogliore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Talia Ogliore – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.05.020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?&lt;/a&gt;” by Keith Hengen et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is criticality a unified setpoint of brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains face selective pressure to optimize computation, broadly defined. This is achieved by mechanisms including development, plasticity, and homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a universal optimum around which the healthy brain tunes itself, across time and individuals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticality hypothesis posits such a setpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticality is a state imbued with internally generated, multiscale, marginally stable dynamics that maximize the features of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental support emerged two decades ago and has accumulated at an accelerating pace despite disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we lay out the logic of criticality as a general computational endpoint and review experimental evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We perform a meta-analysis of 140 datasets published between 2003 and 2024. We find that a long-standing controversy is the product of a methodological choice with no bearing on underlying dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a new generation of research can leverage criticality—as a unifying principle of brain function—to accelerate understanding of behavior, cognition, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:15:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1yeDVpcHRadnNta0ZVREZTTlJEeFVJT3dHblJCbkowa21ORG0ydTlWcnJDV3FJMlM2S3JLWmdHQ25pbmEwU1NJOWVBU2pPT3I2dHEzQ2xRZUM2N2dXbmR2aHJGNXlTVU5MclNwM25QUmwxenFMUzhxUGc5MA</guid></item><item><title>13年前，一位女性被告知她患有阿尔茨海默氏症。现在她在逆转病情后走遍了美国的广阔地带-雅虎 | A woman was told she had Alzheimer’s 13 years ago.

He’s long been a believer that Alzheimer’s isn’t just preventable — it’s reversible, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, Benjamin seeking treatment at the time Bredesen was looking for a “patient zero” was kismet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Brededsen recalled Benjamin taking “copious notes” during her first appointment due to her poor memory. He had Benjamin follow his ReCODE (for “reversal of cognitive decline”) protocol, which included changes to Benjamin’s diet and exercise routine, as well as making adjustments to her sleep habits and starting meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Bredesen explained to &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; about ReCODE: “The bottom line is that it is a personalized, precision medicine protocol that addresses the drivers specific to each person (so it is based on each person’s lab results), and these drivers are in three major groups —energetics (blood flow, oxygenation, etc.), inflammation (from any of many different causes), and toxicity (inorganics, organics, and biotoxins) — and three lesser groups — trophic support (hormones, nutrients, and growth factors), neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine, which is needed for memory), and stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bredesen noted, too, that despite published documentation of the ways in which cognitive decline can be reversed, the vast majority of people remain unaware that it is often possible. Treatment is also more likely to be effective if started early on. He’s documented his research in several books, including &lt;em&gt;The End of Alzheimer's &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Ageless Brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Together, the pair have worked to maintain her progress. She’s become a brain health coach and a yoga instructor, and, as Bredesen described her, “a survivor of cognitive decline, and a remarkable role model for anyone interested in healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Very very few people are capable of walking 3000 miles, from coast to coast. But to have someone doing it who is 81 years old, and has reversed her cognitive decline after a diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s in 2012, is truly historic,” Bredesen told &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“She is doing something that I could not do, nor could most of the people I know. She is truly an inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Benjamin’s message is simple — offering the hope that cognitive decline can be prevented and reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That is really the purpose of my journey,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;“And also to show that you can be 81 years old and walk all this way one step at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:08:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE55cUZPVVZ0eUVSSW9mZ1NBZzhOYVF0SGdGYm1ZWHdJS3RwOUwyUE00eTRMcmJsUS12bWdfRm5EREMyck1VZVg4c1JxbWVwWXpRTGZCNDVlUFhNY0FIWXVHUjBwVzRyRWtSZmptY0ZrNTFhbXFwNVZhR2hR</guid></item><item><title>13年前，一位女性被告知她患有阿尔茨海默氏症。现在，她在逆转病情后走上了美国的宽度-独立报 | A woman was told she had Alzheimer’s 13 years ago.

He had Benjamin follow his ReCODE (for “reversal of cognitive decline”) protocol, which included changes to Benjamin’s diet and exercise routine, as well as making adjustments to her sleep habits and starting meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bredesen explained to &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; about ReCODE: “The bottom line is that it is a personalized, precision medicine protocol that addresses the drivers specific to each person (so it is based on each person’s lab results), and these drivers are in three major groups —energetics (blood flow, oxygenation, etc.), inflammation (from any of many different causes), and toxicity (inorganics, organics, and biotoxins) — and three lesser groups — trophic support (hormones, nutrients, and growth factors), neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine, which is needed for memory), and stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bredesen noted, too, that despite published documentation of the ways in which cognitive decline can be reversed, the vast majority of people remain unaware that it is often possible. Treatment is also more likely to be effective if started early on. He’s documented his research in several books, including &lt;em&gt;The End of Alzheimer's &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Ageless Brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the pair have worked to maintain her progress. She’s become a brain health coach and a yoga instructor, and, as Bredesen described her, “a survivor of cognitive decline, and a remarkable role model for anyone interested in healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very very few people are capable of walking 3000 miles, from coast to coast. But to have someone doing it who is 81 years old, and has reversed her cognitive decline after a diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s in 2012, is truly historic,” Bredesen told &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She is doing something that I could not do, nor could most of the people I know. She is truly an inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Benjamin’s message is simple — offering the hope that cognitive decline can be prevented and reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is really the purpose of my journey,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;“And also to show that you can be 81 years old and walk all this way one step at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPMXVCMUt0dEpTSF9mTFNtd25VX3hlQ1N6RTRISVZGZ01OcUlnZUdOR2oybk5hX2xJNXJxR0RybDVQWF9yd0I4eVN5QlF4UFZiNnlnakFhUmdOMVItSmFfbWIyVlJXdklBQWdETng0ME5OTVJaOHpLcEpiajRmNms4YkdId2VMbU0</guid></item><item><title>肠道医生警告说，数百万人患有“定时炸弹”癌症的风险......以及可以预防的简单补救措施-每日邮报 | Gut doctor warns of 'ticking timebomb' cancer risk that millions are walking around with...and the simple remedy that can prevent it - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPT25mMFZoV2VZWnlXSDg4WDZFMjZNbkc1Z3BoZU40MHhQaXUwZmJGal95M2FyWnc3eENURlZaelFTT2lDRHp2SFFvN1pIakJzU0FsUzd0SmY5bWxJU1RIR2xyMkJrYldmTFdGUlhuUE1IcHJYS0dLbUdack5haENrTkhJdlIwSjFrWnYwSzdwa2JuRTR1MTBkRDVpN2dnZ9IBowFBVV95cUxPSFk5TTJWMWllbVhFUDZHWVJkNkNyY3Ryb2wxV0xnOFZoM0VvWFR5MEJyMW5ING9Dck5EREk2dTJPVk5PaGlKMnpOX2lDSElOcTUzT0REZjVDRU03YUhTU0JmSm81M2N5YXNRRXZTWnZvQlpKWVlGejIxMHhfZURWSjc2RmpheVMwcnZPNEt6OVV1R215dDdiNTlSVl9YQ1ZxLW5N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A gut health doctor has revealed a surprising cause of a deadly &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-28310310-535d-11f0-8f63-054cb700ea5c" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; on the rise in Britain, and millions may be at risk without realising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gastroenterologist Dr Wendi LeBrett warned that many people are unaware acid reflux—when juices from the stomach travel back towards the throat—was a potential risk factor for oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oesophageal cancer forms in oesophagus the tube that carries food and drink to the stomach and is incredibly deadly, with 9 out 10 patients dead within 10 years of being diagnosed, usually because of its subtle symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acid reflux is a risk factor for the disease as the acidic liquid damages the sensitive tissue in the tube can lead to changes in cells that can become cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr LeBrett said acid reflux—which causes problems like heartburn— can be a hidden condition with up to a third of sufferers not suffering 'typical symptoms'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an TikTok &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@socalgastrodoc/video/7518518198044609822"&gt;clip &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;watched over 70,000 times, she said: &lt;/span&gt;'About 60 to 70 per cent of people with acid reflux have the typical symptom of heartburn—the burning sensation in your chest often after eating'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means around one in three do not have typical symptoms or know they have the condition.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such Dr LeBrett, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-283a78f0-535d-11f0-8f63-054cb700ea5c" class=""&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; in the US, said people need to keep track of the hidden signs of acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr LeBrett said acid reflux—which causes problems like heartburn— can be a hidden condition with up to a third of sufferers not suffering 'typical symptoms'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oesophageal cancer, a disease of the tube in the throat that carries food to the stomach, is often caught too late due to easy to dismiss symptoms like heartburn or a sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Watch out for a chronic cough, particularly at night when acid reflux is worse,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Breathing problems can also be a symptom as the acid irritates the airways and can exacerbate conditions like asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Problems swallowing is also an atypical symptom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medic also explained that dentists may spot signs of acid damage to your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs include yellowing of teeth as well as cracks and increased sensitivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She urged anyone frequently experiencing these symptoms to seek help from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commenter on the video said: 'I was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer last year. I’m 36. I’ve had acid reflux most of my life but never thought anything of it. I had all those symptoms you mention but was gaslit and dismissed by my doctors.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While another viewer said that: 'not me having a chronic cough because of my acid, getting it checked next Monday.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may be able to advise on lifestyle changes or prescribe medication and investigations to combat the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated acid reflux can lead to a condition called Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is where cells in the tube have started to change abnormally and are at higher risk of becoming cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates between 3 and 13 per cent of Barrett's oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translate to someone with the condition having an 11-times greater risk of being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer than someone without Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, CRUK estimates about three in five of the near 9,500 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed in Britain each year are preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is considered one of the biggest risk factors for the disease with about one in three cases of the cancer in Britain caused by the habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to heartburn and indigestion a sore throat, especially when swallowing, is another common sign of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are urged to get it checked out by a doctor if they notice it getting worse or remaining for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also suggests that oesophageal is on the rise in Britain with cases having increased 3 per cent overall since the 90s and 10 per cent in men specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year figures showed Britain has one of the highest rates of the disease in Europe with medics warning cases, like other cancers, are on the rise among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer kills 22 patients per day in the UK, one of the highest rates in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data show the UK has 14.2 new cases of oesophageal cancer per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is quadruple Italy's 3.5 cases per 100,000 people per year, triple Spain's 4.4 and double or almost double France's and Germany rate of 7 and 7.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only the Netherlands narrowly beats Britain in Western Europe, sneaking ahead at 14.9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Action Against Heartburn, the campaign group that analysed the data called for greater awareness of oesophageal cancer in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:55:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPT25mMFZoV2VZWnlXSDg4WDZFMjZNbkc1Z3BoZU40MHhQaXUwZmJGal95M2FyWnc3eENURlZaelFTT2lDRHp2SFFvN1pIakJzU0FsUzd0SmY5bWxJU1RIR2xyMkJrYldmTFdGUlhuUE1IcHJYS0dLbUdack5haENrTkhJdlIwSjFrWnYwSzdwa2JuRTR1MTBkRDVpN2dnZ9IBowFBVV95cUxPSFk5TTJWMWllbVhFUDZHWVJkNkNyY3Ryb2wxV0xnOFZoM0VvWFR5MEJyMW5ING9Dck5EREk2dTJPVk5PaGlKMnpOX2lDSElOcTUzT0REZjVDRU03YUhTU0JmSm81M2N5YXNRRXZTWnZvQlpKWVlGejIxMHhfZURWSjc2RmpheVMwcnZPNEt6OVV1R215dDdiNTlSVl9YQ1ZxLW5N</guid></item><item><title>心脏病：与炎症相关的Omega-3和Omega-6脂肪酸- MedicalNewsToday | Heart disease: Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids linked to inflammatory -

They replicated their analysis using data from 12,401 participants in the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using two large datasets, ALSPAC and the UK Biobank, along with a genetic technique called Mendelian randomization, the researchers examined whether these fats cause changes in inflammation, rather than just being associated with it, exploring actual causality. This approach is especially powerful because it helps minimize the usual confounding factors found in nutrition studies, such as lifestyle or other dietary habits. In other words, the researchers went beyond asking who has more inflammation and what they eat and instead tried to determine whether the fats themselves were directly responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M.

In their analysis, they controlled for household social class at birth, maternal highest education qualification at birth, maternal and paternal smoking status during pregnancy, offspring sex at birth, type of drinker at age 24 , type of smoker at 24 , and at age in months at 24-year clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/42448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daisy Crick&lt;/a&gt;, corresponding author, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Queensland University, Australia, and MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, The University of Queesland, Australia, explained their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary fatty acids were measured using levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10776907/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DHA&lt;/a&gt;, total omega-3 LA, total omega-6, and the omega-6:omega-3 ratio found in the blood. Inflammation was measured using substances in the blood called biomarkers and specifically we used the biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Glycoprotein Acetyls (GlycA).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can omega-3s be inflammatory?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers found that in both cohorts, both omega-3 and omega-6 levels were associated with higher levels of GlycA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surprisingly, the results showed that both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were associated with higher levels of a marker called GlycA (a novel inflammatory marker), which reflects low-grade chronic inflammation. This was unexpected, especially for omega-3s, which are widely promoted as anti-inflammatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-3s are found in dark fatty fish, like salmon and sardines, and in plant-based foods like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. Most people think of them as calming to the immune system. Yet in this study, higher omega-3 levels were linked to more inflammation, not less, at least when GlycA was used as the measurement,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the ALSPAC cohort, there was a consistent association between a higher omega-6:omega-3 ratio and all three inflammatory biomarkers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told us that this ratio is influenced by our changed diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [finding] supports earlier findings that it’s not just about how much omega-3 you consume; it’s about how balanced your overall intake is. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6269634/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; highlights how this ratio has shifted dramatically in recent history. A century ago, people typically consumed a 4:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3. Today, due to modern diets rich in industrial seed oils, that ratio has ballooned to around 15:1 to 20:1. This shift creates a pro-inflammatory environment that could be contributing to chronic diseases, allergies, and autoimmune disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that it’s not as simple as ‘omega-3 is anti-inflammatory, and omega-6 is pro-inflammatory’. Just increasing the consumption of omega-3 through diet or supplements might not be enough to lower inflammation. Instead, our results suggest that it might be more useful to look at the balance or ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 in the diet. Improving the balance between the two fats could be a better method for people who want to reduce inflammation in their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Daisy Crick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study found an association between PUFAs and some of the 3 biomarkers, the authors emphasize that different biomarkers measure different aspects of inflammation, so by assessing only 3 biomarkers, they may have missed some important effects of PUFAs on inflammation. Further research using additional biomarkers is needed to better understand the relationship between PUFAs and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that these findings should lead to further research: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is important to remember that the study measured just three inflammatory markers. The immune system is incredibly complex, and omega fatty acids might influence other pathways that weren’t captured here. For example, omega-3s might still help resolve short-term inflammation or protect against specific diseases, even if they raise GlycA slightly. More research using a broader range of immune biomarkers will help clarify this relationship.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this limitation, the findings highlight that there may be more to the relationship between fatty acids and health than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between fatty acids and inflammation is complex and our findings only tell part of the story. Although we show that omega-3 fats are associated with increases in some biomarkers of inflammation, it does not rule out other potential beneficial effects of these fatty acids in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Daisy Crick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNakhfNVFQaUVSUEpFS2xuQ0lUbjhRTGhDZnk4Z2dqU3N5OEltUDBjb0FubFg1ZUlxdXBFbGh2YllVOGpOZWlyeTBaaFBGZjEtdnl0M3ExNWRMY3RSN05wVDM5dUJjcjhLWTdGdmtnWkFrSFRkUG5KV1JOVkpWMlN1ZTBJMGR5cHdRX1JrX3dDWTI2bG9TQWFYbGUxUVNoOUU0VFkwa1h4WGFueXF6NmYxbkV5VzdTTFR2Skltamc1Z3pmVUk</guid></item><item><title>神经大脑植入物提供近乎瞬时的语音- Ars Technica | A neural brain implant provides near instantaneous speech - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPbEh1S3JwTXp2Y2tCT2JXUUF1NGljbEx5alZRdmkxLU80N3NjZWNVT0dDX1dETUoxVXlCNDhuU1BGQW4zZ29qdVcxLXFjNnVsZ3ZZUGJTTXZlNUJFQlJibmxJT1dxZTBqRlctUXJNYkc5Tk1zUHFOS0h0dlhPUTJ4bHJPcEFkYzZPbnBsdVVPTmhFRDVzWTlYd3JvLXlEdG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Delays and dictionaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after the Stanford work, in 2024, Stavisky’s team &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2314132"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its own research on a brain-to-text system that bumped the accuracy to 97.5 percent. “Almost every word was correct, but communicating over text can be limiting, right?” Stavisky said. “Sometimes you want to use your voice. It allows you to make interjections, it makes it less likely other people interrupt you—you can sing, you can use words that aren’t in the dictionary.” But the most common approach to generating speech relied on synthesizing it from text, which led straight into another problem with BCI systems: very high latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nearly all BCI speech aids, sentences appeared on a screen after a significant delay, long after the patient finished stringing the words together in their mind. The speech synthesis part usually happened after the text was ready, which caused even more delay. Brain-to-text solutions also suffered from a limited vocabulary. The latest system of this kind supported a dictionary of roughly 1,300 words. When you tried to speak a different language, use more elaborate vocabulary, or even say the unusual name of a café just around the corner, the systems failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Wairagkar designed her prosthesis to translate brain signals into sounds, not words—and do it in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extracting sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient who agreed to participate in Wairagkar’s study was codenamed T15 and was a 46-year-old man suffering from ALS. “He is severely paralyzed and when he tries to speak, he is very difficult to understand. I’ve known him for several years, and when he speaks, I understand maybe 5 percent of what he’s saying,” says David M. Brandman, a neurosurgeon and co-author of the study. Before working with the UC Davis team, T15 communicated using a gyroscopic head mouse to control a cursor on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, though, some people infected with COVID in China &lt;a href="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are reporting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;are reporting&lt;/a&gt; a very sore throat that’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; trends data, people throughout the U.S. are now, too, worried about this scary-sounding symptom and are searching for things like “new covid variant painful symptom” and “covid razor throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how worried do you need to be about a super-painful sore throat during a COVID infection? Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64c3e4b0bd0253106e62" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

It’s essential for nerve, muscle and heart function, he added. It’s also important for &lt;a href="https://americanbonehealth.org/nutrition/minerals-for-bone-health/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="maintaining bone health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://americanbonehealth.org/nutrition/minerals-for-bone-health/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;maintaining bone health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/mount-sinai/care/nutrition/team" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Perri Halperin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/mount-sinai/care/nutrition/team" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Perri Halperin&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical nutrition coordinator at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, the recommended daily magnesium intake for adult men is between 400 and 420 milligrams of magnesium per day. For women, that number is a little lower — between 310 and 320 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisniewski said in a Western diet, roughly two-thirds of people are not getting enough magnesium. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/feeling-fatigued-could-it-be-magnesium-deficiency-and-if-so-what-to-do-about-it/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="And according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/feeling-fatigued-could-it-be-magnesium-deficiency-and-if-so-what-to-do-about-it/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;And according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, many people with a magnesium deficiency have no symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms, so you are probably unaware if you fall into this category. (For some, though, low magnesium levels may present as nausea and fatigue.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s virtually no risk of over-consuming magnesium when you’re getting it &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/foods-that-are-high-in-magnesium/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="through food" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/foods-that-are-high-in-magnesium/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;through food&lt;/a&gt;, Halperin said. Plus, extra magnesium from food is pretty easily filtered out by your kidneys unless you have kidney issues, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the case for supplementation, though — which can cause adverse effects like diarrhea and low blood pressure in those who have too much magnesium. “[It’s] hard to reach the levels of magnesium that cause toxicity through diet alone, but much easier when you’re popping a pill,” Halperin explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It’s always a good idea to let your doctor know what supplements you’re taking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Jesse Wisniewski, clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s more, when comparing magnesium-rich food and magnesium supplements, the magnesium our bodies get through food has been highly studied; research shows it helps with the necessary functions mentioned above. However, magnesium as a supplement ― and any potential benefits that come from it ― is far less studied, Halperin explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the supplements still exist on the market for a reason ― and it’s hard to ignore the glowing &lt;span&gt;testimonials&lt;/span&gt; many have posted about magnesium pills. Not to mention the fact that there are multiple options out there, including magnesium glycinate, magnesium citrate and magnesium L-threonate (and that’s not even all of them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do all of those work for the same problems? What’s the difference? Do we even need it? We asked experts to find out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A magnesium supplement is good for constipation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I would say the best-researched use of magnesium that we have a lot of good data on is for constipation,” said &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=6384d007e4b06ef4a546a27d&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gina Milano" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=6384d007e4b06ef4a546a27d&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Gina Milano&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical dietitian at Stanford Health Care in California. “And so there’s various forms of magnesium that are used to help alleviate constipation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One form is magnesium oxide, which Milano said is inexpensive and easy to find at your local grocery store. Magnesium oxide is not well absorbed by the body, Milano said, so even if you are taking large doses of it, your body isn’t actually soaking much of it up. “However, it’s helpful for promoting and alleviating constipation,” Milano added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium hydroxide is also good for constipation, she said.

There was also a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9786204/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="small 2022 study " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9786204/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;small 2022 study &lt;/a&gt;in humans that found magnesium L-threonate, coupled with vitamins and minerals including vitamins C and D, positively affected cognition as well. But it’s unclear if it was the magnesium itself or the other items used in tandem, Milano noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional testing is needed to determine just how effective magnesium is for memory and cognition. And Milano said you should be wary of brands touting the benefits of magnesium L-threonate before more research is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the thought here is, ‘Oh, maybe this can be only used on a daily basis, but maybe it also could be used in prevention and treatment for elderly adults who are struggling with cognition’ … that’s looking a little bit more promising,” Milano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The data on magnesium’s effect on sleep is mixed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence behind using magnesium for better sleep, Wisniewski said. &lt;span&gt;“Sleep ... that is definitely one of the common ones that people are using it for, and there’s some limited evidence about it,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The studies on this have largely looked at older adults, but suggest magnesium can help people fall asleep faster, though it did not increase the amount of time they were actually asleep, Wisniewski explained. That said, the strongest evidence is from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945703000674?via%3Dihub" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="short-term studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945703000674?via%3Dihub" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;short-term studies&lt;/a&gt; (so the effects and risks long-term are unknown), and the favorable results could have been by chance, Wisniewski added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Magnesium assists with neurological pathways, and when they’re not functioning appropriately due to low levels, it can lead to mood disorders [and] sleep disorders ― but it’s not well understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Perri Halperin, clinical nutrition coordinator at Mount Sinai Health System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halperin and Milano both added that more research is needed before magnesium can be considered a science-backed sleep aid. Milano also said that many studies don’t explicitly state the type of magnesium used for better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to try magnesium for sleep, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/does-magnesium-help-you-sleep/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/does-magnesium-help-you-sleep/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; suggests magnesium glycinate or magnesium citrate, though you should check with your doctor before starting a new supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The same goes for magnesium’s impact on depression and stress.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Depression is another area of interest when it comes to magnesium. I think depression, sleep, brain fog [improvements are] all related to the fact that magnesium assists with neurological pathways, and when they’re not functioning appropriately due to low levels, it can lead to mood disorders [and] sleep disorders ― but it’s not well understood,” Halperin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Milano, there have been a few randomized controlled trials exploring magnesium’s use for depression, and some studies have shown that magnesium did&lt;a href="https://www.jabfm.org/content/28/2/249" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" improve depressive symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jabfm.org/content/28/2/249" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt; improve depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, but additional research is necessary — the studies largely saw benefits in older adults 65 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to stress, Wisniewski said studies suggest that taking magnesium and Vitamin B6 together can help with mental health and stress levels. But it’s unclear how much of a role magnesium plays.&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33864354/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" The study found" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33864354/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt; The study found&lt;/a&gt; that when magnesium was taken without Vitamin B6, it was not as effective for stress management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before starting any kind of supplement, speak with your doctor. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ultimately, it’s always a good idea to let your doctor know what supplements you’re taking,” Wisniewski said, adding that if your doctor isn’t available, then you can also speak with a pharmacist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it is possible to consume too much magnesium, which can result in &lt;span&gt;diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, low mood, muscle weakness, low blood pressure and an abnormal heartbeat, according to Halperin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Wisniewski said magnesium supplements can interfere with certain medications for issues like thyroid disorders or HIV, and can also interfere with certain antibiotics. It’s crucial that folks with any chronic conditions talk to a medical professional before taking magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say you should follow a food-first approach in most cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We often want our clients, patients, etc. to get micronutrients from food instead of relying on supplements to fix a problem,” Halperin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re worried you’re not getting enough magnesium or you’re hearing about the powers of magnesium, go ahead and start by incorporating magnesium-rich foods into your diet,” Milano added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This includes green, leafy vegetables like spinach and Swiss chard, nuts, seeds, beans, legumes and whole grains. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For reference, 1 ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium, 1 ounce of pumpkin seeds have 150 milligrams and half a cup of black beans has 60 milligrams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/foods-that-are-high-in-magnesium/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685d64f9e4b0dc2d3f533c53" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/foods-that-are-high-in-magnesium/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe even playing around with the timing of those foods to see if that does reduce your anxiety and depression in heightened moments or if it does help you sleep a little bit better,” Milano added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do decide you want to try magnesium supplements for any of the uses above, be sure to buy your supplement from a reputable source, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FDA does not regulate supplements, and many markets throw out products with big health claims,” Milano said. Look for products that are USP-certified or NSF-certified, she noted.
