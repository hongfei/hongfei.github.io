By some estimates, in the US, matcha sales have reached more than $10billion over the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, the matcha market is estimated to be valued at $4.3billion, and the ever-increasing demand is putting a strain on the world's supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with its many benefits, it lacks the dangers of coffee, which was tied to vision problems in a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In research published last month, Chinese scientists said they found a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14850803/doctors-warning-drinking-coffee-linked-blindness.html"&gt;link between instant coffee and age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD) - an eye disease that causes blurry or distorted central vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed people with a preference for instant coffee were up to seven times more likely to develop the disorder than drinkers of other types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the link could be due to the way instant coffee is prepared, which releases a chemical called acrylamide that may enter the bloodstream and damage the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, studies have linked matcha to lowering blood pressure and inflammation, and improving alertness and concentration. Antioxidants in the powder have also been linked to reduction in risk of chronic conditions, cancer and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The market for matcha is booming, as more and more people flock to health food and organic stores to stock up on the green liquid gold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If switching to matcha, you can enjoy all its benefits without giving up your need for caffeine. According to Harvard Health, in one 8oz cup, matcha contains 38 to 89mg of caffeine, compared to 100 to 120mg in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the content may be lower, that energy boost is more stable and longer-lasting than coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When drinking coffee, energy levels experience a quick surge, but, as fast as they're boosted, they come crashing down suddenly just a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With matcha, people still experience increased energy, but the heightened level is maintained over a longer period of time, providing steady energy for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And rather than experiencing a sudden crash, levels gradually decline over several hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha also contains theanine, which is believed to have a superior effect on cognitive function than caffeine alone, and the combination contributes to improved attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Theanine also serves to release the amount of caffeine in the body at a slower rate, preventing the typical caffeine crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2024 study, 99 people, including 64 with self-reported cognitive decline and 35 with mild cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to receive either matcha or a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed matcha consumption was associated with improved social cognitive function - a criterion for diagnosing dementia - specifically the perception of emotions from facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a separate 2020 study, female matcha drinkers saw an improvement in cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matcha is finely ground powder made from green tea leaves that is whisked together with hot water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another benefit of matcha compared to coffee: no coffee breath or stained teeth. It can actually improve oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Tea Makers of London, superpowered antioxidants found in matcha fight bacteria that grow in your mouth and cause damage. It reduces plaque-buildup and relieves symptoms of gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha can also be a supplement for weight loss. Unlike over-processed sports drinks and metabolism boosters, matcha has natural ingredients that improve metabolism and increase energy levels, putting you into fat burning levels safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It won't raise blood pressure or cortisol, and is a great pre-workout drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, a good cup of matcha is much easier and less expensive to make than coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha requires almost no equipment and can be made by simply whisking the powder in hot water or milk, compared to at-home coffee makers and espresso machines that can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Traditionally, one major obstacle in fighting cancer is overcoming the tumor’s ability to suppress the body's immune response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; have created an innovative treatment capable of turning immunologically inactive tumors into targets the immune system can attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_novel_approach_to_immunotherapy"&gt;A Novel Approach to Immunotherapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-vaccine-successfully-treats-skin-and-pancreatic-cancer/"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; often involve injecting immune-activating substances directly into tumors. However, not all cancers are easily reachable. To overcome this challenge, the Stanford team combined two crucial elements into a single synthetic molecule, PIP-CpG. One part of the molecule, PIP, identifies and binds specifically to integrins—proteins commonly found on cancer cells. The other part, CpG, acts as an immunostimulant by activating Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Idit Sagiv-Barfi (RIGHT) and Ronald Levy (LEFT) pioneered a potential cancer therapy by injecting two immune-boosting agents directly into solid tumors.

By directly targeting tumor sites, this treatment ensures that the immune-stimulating drug accumulates precisely where it’s needed most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="effective_tumor_targeting_and_immune_activation"&gt;Effective Tumor Targeting and Immune Activation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested this therapy in mice suffering from aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-discovery-reduces-breast-cancer-recurrence/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving just three doses, six out of nine mice survived significantly longer than untreated mice. Even more promisingly, three of these mice appeared completely cured, showing no tumor recurrence over several months. Impressively, a single dose was sufficient for complete tumor elimination in half of the tested mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Cochran, PhD, Shriram Chair of the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford, was enthusiastic about these remarkable results. "We essentially cured some animals with just a few injections," she said. "It was pretty astonishing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined the treated tumors, they observed a drastic transformation. Previously dominated by cells suppressing immune activity, the tumors became filled with activated immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. This shift mirrors the results usually seen only with direct tumor injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="overcoming_limitations_of_previous_therapies"&gt;Overcoming Limitations of Previous Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While injecting immune-stimulating substances directly into tumors has shown promise, it presents significant limitations. Not all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-breakthrough-detects-brain-tumors-the-size-of-a-pinhead-with-97-accuracy/"&gt;tumors&lt;/a&gt; are easily accessible, and injections typically fail to affect distant tumors effectively. This severely limits the therapy’s usefulness for cancers that spread or recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, systemic administration (delivery through the bloodstream) of TLR9 agonists alone has had limited success due to poor tumor targeting. CpG, the immunostimulant component of the new molecule, recognizes specific DNA sequences typical in bacteria and viruses. Although CpG activates strong immune responses, previous attempts to deliver it through systemic methods failed to adequately concentrate the substance at tumor sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic showing PIP-AF680 localizing to a tumor after intravenous (IV) injection by binding tumor-associated integrin receptors.

Compared to standard treatments using only CpG, mice treated with PIP-CpG showed improved survival rates and more effective tumor reduction, even in challenging cancers like pancreatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="transforming_the_tumor_microenvironment"&gt;Transforming the Tumor Microenvironment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential aspect of cancer progression involves the tumor’s environment, which often prevents the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-smart-immune-cells-continuously-hunt-and-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; from recognizing and attacking cancer cells. This environment typically contains cells like myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which block immune responses and promote tumor growth. The Stanford team discovered that their targeted treatment dramatically altered this environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Levy, MD, a senior author and professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine, highlighted the significance of this finding. "The sculpting of the tumor microenvironment by this intravenously administered molecule was identical to injecting immune-stimulating agents directly into the tumor," he explained. "This is a big advantage because it's no longer necessary to have an easily or safely injectable tumor site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic showing PIP-CpG localizing to a tumor after IV injection by binding tumor-associated integrin receptors. (CREDIT: Cell Chemical Biology) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shifting the tumor environment from immunosuppressive to immune-activating, the PIP-CpG molecule helps the body's natural defenses engage effectively with cancer cells. This approach holds promise for treating various cancers, potentially including those currently considered hard-to-reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="potential_for_versatile_cancer_treatment"&gt;Potential for Versatile Cancer Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling aspects of this study is the versatility of the targeting molecule, PIP. Developed by Cochran’s team, PIP binds efficiently to integrins present in various cancers, making it widely applicable. Caitlyn Miller, a graduate student and lead author, emphasized, "PIP is a really versatile tumor-targeting agent because it can localize to so many &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/innovations/revolutionary-new-cancer-treatment-destroys-tumors-in-less-than-6-days/"&gt;different types of tumors&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike larger antibody-based treatments, the smaller peptide-based molecules offer benefits like rapid clearance from the bloodstream, easier penetration into tumors, and simpler manufacturing processes. The Stanford team has previously used similar approaches to deliver chemotherapy drugs and imaging agents directly to tumors, demonstrating the reliability and flexibility of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;PIP-CpG transforms the immune landscape of 4T1 tumors. 4T1 cells were implanted subcutaneously in one side of the abdomen of BALB/c mice.

The team included senior scientists Jennifer Cochran, Carolyn Bertozzi, PhD, Ronald Levy, and lead researchers Caitlyn Miller and Idit Sagiv-Barfi, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building upon earlier studies, researchers are optimistic about the treatment's potential. A prior study by Levy and Sagiv-Barfi using direct tumor injections showed that CpG combinations could eliminate local tumors and distant metastases, even preventing future tumor growth. These results led to ongoing clinical trials for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-gene-editing-breakthrough-eliminates-50-of-head-neck-tumors/"&gt;certain lymphomas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After more than 10 years of work on PIP, it is rewarding to experience this convergence of expertise," Cochran said, highlighting the decade-long collaborative effort. This groundwork sets the stage for future trials in humans, though further research will be necessary to ensure safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;PIP-CpG elicits a T-cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response including 4T1 tumor implantation and treatment.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gastrointestinal health, there’s often a focus on eating probiotic-packed foods. However, all of the other foods you eat—including proteins—can influence the composition of the bacteria in your gut microbiome, too. Some are more beneficial than others.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fish—especially fatty fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines—are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can benefit your microbiome by reducing inflammation in the digestive tract. Certain types of fish, such as salmon, also contain vitamin D, an essential nutrient that may influence the type of bacteria in the intestines, as well as protect intestinal lining from inflammation and injury.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://foodsensitivitydietitian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen White, RDN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Food Sensitivity Dietitian, says that fish is also generally easier to digest than red meat, which may be beneficial if you experience &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072214/sneaky-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken and turkey are excellent sources of lean proteins. They contain amino acids such as glutamine and tryptophan, known to support a healthy microbiome. For example, tryptophan is metabolized by intestinal bacteria that may help make the intestinal lining strong and durable and reduce inflammation, says , &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/decker/health-wellness-studies/profile.html?id=lina" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lina Begdache, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and assistant professor of Health and Wellness Studies at Binghamton University, State University of New York.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, poultry contains B vitamins that play a role in the production of butyrate, which also supports a healthy intestinal barrier.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, an important nutrient that helps promote regular digestion and increase healthy bacteria in the GI tract. One cup of canned black beans provides about 17 grams of this important nutrient and 15 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beans are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that helps gut bacteria flourish, and research shows that eating more beans improves the growth of good bacteria in the GI tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out all of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18236/ingredients/beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy bean recipes&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research reveals that dietary protein may influence the makeup of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as how it functions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The theory is that not all dietary proteins get digested, and as undigested protein arrives in the colon, some bacteria may use the amino acids (building blocks of proteins) as an energy source, producing byproducts called metabolites.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These metabolites may then play a role in metabolism and our immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you going for plant- or animal-based protein? That makes a difference in this discussion. Animal proteins are complete proteins, meaning they provide all the essential amino acids in proportions needed for health, says White. These amino acids are crucial for a range of bodily functions, including tissue repair and immune system support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Animal proteins are generally well-tolerated and easily digested by most people. [Animal proteins] can be particularly beneficial for individuals with digestive issues or sensitivities, as they are less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort than some plant-based proteins,” White explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although animal proteins are complete, some plant-based and vegetarian proteins, like tofu and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8016443/proteins-you-should-eat-every-week/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt;, are also complete proteins. You can still get all of the amino acids you need if eating primarily plant-based proteins, like beans and nuts, but it’s important to eat a wide variety of options to meet your needs. Animal proteins are easy to digest for most people, although many plant-based proteins provide other benefits, such as fiber and healthy fats. Eating a wide variety of protein options is recommended to provide a range of nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-considerations-when-choosing-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Considerations When Choosing Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change up your proteins: Eat a variety of animal- and plant-based proteins for balanced nutrition. Along with the animal proteins on this list, check out these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods that have more protein than an egg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about cooking methods: “How these proteins are prepared can significantly impact their effects on gut health,” says White. Both White and Begdache recommend cooking methods such as grilling, baking, poaching and steaming to retain more nutrients and support heart and overall health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for natural proteins over supplements: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032853/what-does-protein-powder-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Protein powders&lt;/a&gt; and shakes have their place, and they can help you meet your protein needs. However, there’s a benefit to choosing food when you can, including a wider array of nutrients. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While protein may play a key role in gut health, Begdache advises not to consume protein foods in large amounts without sources of fiber-rich carbohydrates, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains or legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-protein, low-fiber diet may change the gut microbiome by altering the types of metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The healthy microbes that live in the GI tract feed on undigested complex carbohydrates like fiber,” Begdache explains. “High-protein foods, [generally] tend to lack these complex fibers; therefore, their presence in the gut may change the composition of the gut microbiota into a less health-favorable one,” she says. Conversely, a high-fiber diet that includes complex carbohydrate foods may help protect the gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begdache also indicates that protein digestion in the stomach differs from one person to another. “People with low stomach acid or pancreatic problems may not digest proteins effectively. Consequently, the more undigested proteins enter the colon, the less advantageous these proteins are,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat—including protein choices—may influence the health and balance of your gut microbiome.

A simple twist on walking, first tested in Japan, may be the missing ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “Japanese walking” exercise methodology, called interval walking training (&lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IWT&lt;/a&gt;), swaps steady strolling for bursts of brisk movement, then recovery‑paced steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiometabolic researcher &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kristian-karstoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristian Karstoft&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Copenhagen’s &lt;a href="https://healthyaging.ku.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; has spent more than a decade tracking its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-pace-changes-matter"&gt;Why pace changes matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most walkers cruise at one comfortable speed and never raise their heart rate high enough to stimulate deeper adaptations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching between fast and slow bouts nudges the body to use oxygen more efficiently, a trait measured by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VO2peak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That oxygen boost drives down resting blood pressure and encourages muscles to burn more sugar for fuel. It also keeps a session feeling manageable because the recovery intervals prevent the distress that can accompany continuous hard effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular shifts in speed even appear to sharpen insulin action, regulating blood sugar swings that set the stage for diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call that improvement better &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycemic-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glycemic control&lt;/a&gt;, a term describing how tightly the body keeps glucose within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-japanese-walking-works"&gt;How “Japanese walking” works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese physiologists outline a straightforward walking recipe, alternating three minutes at roughly seventy percent of personal maximum effort with three minutes around forty percent. Completing five of these cycles takes about half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, interval walking training is a great way to meet the recommended 150 minutes a week of moderate‑intensity aerobic activity,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/23054/sarah-eby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarah F. Eby&lt;/a&gt;, the sports medicine specialist at Mass &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and assistant professor at &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/211149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That schedule, performed on at least five days each week, fits neatly into current public‑health advice to accumulate one hundred fifty minutes of moderate exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple watch or phone app can cue the switches, though early Japanese volunteers used a waist‑worn beeper nicknamed &lt;a href="https://www.pubcompare.ai/product/VyniCZIBPBHhf-iFORRd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JD Mate&lt;/a&gt;. Supportive shoes and a safe sidewalk are the only other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proof-in-older-adults"&gt;Proof in older adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a seminal five‑month experiment involving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25539937/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adults averaging sixty‑three years old&lt;/a&gt;, IWT raised VO2peak ten percent and drove &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic pressure&lt;/a&gt; down nine millimeters of mercury compared with either continuous walking or no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knee strength climbed as much as seventeen percent, a critical buffer against falls. Body mass index dipped and fasting glucose improved within weeks, suggesting metabolic changes arrive quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What surprised the investigators most was adherence. Ninety‑five percent of more than eight hundred participants kept the habit for the full study window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who logged at least four sessions a week enjoyed the biggest gains, reinforcing the idea that consistency outranks intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held over nearly two years, although adherence slipped for volunteers starting with higher waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-of-iwt-japanese-walking"&gt;Benefits of IWT Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Danish trial later pitted IWT against energy‑matched continuous &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-walking-improves-mobility-and-prevents-falls-in-older-adults/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; in adults living with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the interval group shrank abdominal fat and cut twenty‑four‑hour glucose fluctuations, despite similar caloric burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to energy‑expenditure and time‑duration matched continuous walking training, IWT is superior for improving physical fitness, body composition, and glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes,” stated Karstoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow‑up mechanistic work pointed toward enhanced glucose effectiveness, meaning muscles absorbed sugar without extra insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-and-sticking-with-it"&gt;Safety and sticking with it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because walking remains fully aerobic, lactate rarely spikes and the risk of cardiac complications stays low. No serious adverse events surfaced across dozens of trials, even among recent joint‑replacement patients cleared by their surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital prompts can help sustain motivation once novelty fades. Yet data from a Danish smartphone roll‑out show that unsupervised users averaged only nine minutes of fast &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/upright-walking-may-have-sparked-human-creativity-and-music/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; per week after a year, underscoring the value of social or clinical follow‑up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaching, group strolls, or gamified leaderboards may lift engagement, particularly for people carrying extra weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing whether regular phone calls paired with step‑count feedback can duplicate laboratory adherence in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-started-today"&gt;Getting started today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consult your clinician if you have chronic conditions, then pick a flat route and set a timer for thirty minutes. Begin with one minute brisk, one minute relaxed for fifteen cycles, or even shorter bursts until comfort builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies specifically looking at the benefits of interval &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/"&gt;walking training&lt;/a&gt; have found improved physical fitness, muscle strength, and glycemic control,” said Eby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advises ramping up gradually so each brisk interval still allows a short phrase before breath runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track sessions on a calendar; seeing streaks grow is strangely satisfying. Celebrate milestones such as a lower belt notch or an easier climb up the porch steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final word for anyone who thinks walking is too gentle to matter, remember that pace, not mileage, drives adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese approach proves that swapping a few calm blocks for a confident stride can steer health markers in the right direction long before you break into a jog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 21:12:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQNE1uNDQ2T1pKSVFSRlIwb2FsZWtySWlCLWlGNGNSTmotOXFld2ZFNzRPdHg0MEtzaVlQUW43X0xycXVTdTN3MHFvbWdVZEU5Z0lEaGxZNTdkazBTWUY4U3lKWXpFMUJkVXhya2RkdmxEVmpYOFlzckdYSlFDVExJLWFNUnJOSkNCNm9XbVByVkw3S2VSQm82Q09hcEp2cHM2Qkpqeklxa2U0aTgtV3c</guid></item><item><title>自2000年美国宣布根除麻疹以来，麻疹病例达到最高水平-今日美国 | Measles cases hit highest level since it was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000 - USA Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQR05BT0hDUzBHQTZ1dFJpSXlWLTBlX25DLXhUbG0tbF9aWmZPTXV2a3hUTUpjei1PYU1UQWRIUjRXTE9Tc3NOSURtd0xYMW85LUMxRF9pc0Z5QmNzRHF3WmFyc05XWFNlZi1HLVFKQ1J6ODJ0Zmd4SDhHYndGOVprYU54aTU2LW9QenY3NmZhd0RpWEhzVnF6cjBGWWIydmdwX1BN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This year's measles outbreak is the worst since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.

			&lt;p&gt;Stores of glucose in the brain could play a much more significant role in the pathological degeneration of neurons than scientists realized, opening the way to new treatments for conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a tauopathy; a condition characterized by harmful build-ups of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside neurons. It's not clear, however, if these build-ups are a cause or a consequence of the disease. &lt;span&gt;A new study now adds important detail by revealing significant interactions between tau and glucose in its stored form of glycogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in the US, the research sheds new light on the functions of glycogen in the brain. Before now, it's only been regarded as an energy backup for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;the liver and the muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute. "Stored glycogen doesn't just sit there in the brain, it is involved in pathology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/insulin-isnt-just-made-by-the-pancreas-heres-another-location-few-know-about?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Insulin Isn't Just Made by The Pancreas. Here's Another Location Few Know About.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on links previously found between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu024"&gt;glycogen and neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers spotted evidence of excessive glycogen levels both in tauopathy models created in fruit flies (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and in the brain cells of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed a key mechanism at play: tau proteins interrupt the normal breakdown and use of glycogen in the brain, adding to the dangerous build-up of both tau and glycogen, as well as lowering protective neuron defense barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg" alt="Brain scans" class="wp-image-166553 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-554x415.jpg 554w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at the effects of a build-up of tau proteins and glycogen in fruit fly brains. Above are normal brains; below, brains with tauopathy show increased vacuole size, marked by arrows. (Bar et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to this interaction is the activity of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_phosphorylase"&gt;glycogen phosphorylase&lt;/a&gt; or GlyP, the main enzyme tasked with turning glycogen into a fuel the body can use. When the researchers boosted GlyP production in fruit flies, glycogen stores were utilized once more, helping to fight back against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Buck Institute &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;biologist Sudipta Bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wondered if a restricted diet – already associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00226-3"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt; – would help. When fruit flies affected by tauopathy were put on a low-protein diet, they lived longer and showed reduced brain damage, suggesting that the metabolic shift prompted by dieting can help boost GlyP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a notable set of findings, not least because it suggests a way that glycogen and tau aggregation could be tackled in the brain. The researchers also developed a drug based around the 8-Br-cAMP molecule to mimic the effects of dietary restriction, which had similar effects on flies in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work might even tie into research involving GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, designed to manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reduce weight loss, but also now showing promise for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-may-guard-against-dementia-research-finds"&gt;protecting against dementia&lt;/a&gt;. That might be because these drugs interact with one of glycogen's pathways, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell's inner chemistry to fight age-related decline," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding – and perhaps rebalancing – our brain's hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01314-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Small health wins can add up, which is why it's a good practice to &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/823679/nutrient-dense-foods-you-should-add-to-your-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;add nutrient-dense foods to your diet&lt;/a&gt;. The more nutritional value a food has, the more benefits it can offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fortunately, there's no shortage of versatile, functional foods to discover. And one that checks a lot of health boxes is passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you're new to passion fruit, you might be surprised at its compact size. But don't worry: It delivers plenty of health value. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2709248/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, the fragrant, sweet-sour, seedy pulp of just one average-sized passion fruit (about 18 grams) clocks in at 1.87 grams of fiber and 5.22 milligrams of magnesium — all for under 18 calories. In addition to those nutrients, passion fruit is filled with vitamins and compounds that give it antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What do these nutritional elements mean? Essentially, this tropical fruit may be able to help you control your blood sugar, reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, and boost your sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Andreypopov/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let's look at the relationship between eating passion fruit and managing your blood sugar. Passion fruit falls low on the glycemic index (GI), as shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-of-tropical-fruits-Passos-Sampaio/5cdbf7d22c55f3f079a252574a678a5fdcc14c6e" target="_blank"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; in Food Science and Technology. This means that it's not likely to cause a sudden sugar surge after consumption. On the contrary, your blood sugar numbers should stabilize after eating low-GI foods like passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you're relying on foods to manage your blood sugars, but you crave sweets, passion fruit may be useful as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/416386/what-is-the-glycemic-index/" target="_blank"&gt;low-GI diet&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the fruit has sugar, but its &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1075718/unexpected-health-benefits-of-naturally-occurring-sugars/" target="_blank"&gt;naturally occurring sugars can have blood sugar benefits&lt;/a&gt; because of its fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Can't find fresh passion fruit? The fruit's juice may also give you blood sugar management advantages, despite its low fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, findings from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899059/#bib18" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; from Current Research in Physiology showed that when subjects drank passion fruit juice, their post-meal blood sugar levels significantly dropped compared to subjects who drank a placebo beverage. Subjects also saw an improvement in their ability to focus on certain tasks, which might give you another reason to try passion fruit juice alone or in a tropical passion fruit juice smoothie. The aforementioned study also reported a dip in the systolic blood pressure readings of subjects who consumed passion fruit juice, offering a window into the potential heart-friendliness of passion fruit and its natural byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;Passion fruit is also good for your heart and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What makes passion fruit good for your heart? In its raw form, passion fruit contains fiber, and fiber can be useful in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. However, even passion fruit juice may possess cardioprotective capabilities because of its antioxidants. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722928/" target="_blank"&gt;2019 article&lt;/a&gt; from Biomolecules recommended using antioxidants to benefit the heart and vascular system without the need for drugs. The article concluded that consuming antioxidants could be a valid therapy for treating cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even if you juice your passion fruit, you won't lose antioxidants in the finished product, as determined in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963996918300206" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that was outlined in Food Research International. The experiment demonstrated that passion fruit juice had antioxidant stability, bioavailability, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Passion fruit may provide another benefit as well: improved sleep. As mentioned, passion fruit contains sizable amounts of magnesium. And magnesium may make it easier to fall asleep as well as allow you to sleep longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You can't depend on the magnesium in passion fruit to solve all your snoozing issues, though. In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/does-magnesium-help-you-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Naoki Umeda, an integrative medicine specialist, said that the studies around taking magnesium to support sleep aren't conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, Dr. Umeda admits that "some people have found it helps them", so he's not opposed to the practice since magnesium "may help regulate neurotransmitters that are directly related to sleep." And that's a good excuse to try this tiny but mighty fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of chewed birch bark tar gum unearthed in western Sweden has unlocked a window into ancient life, revealing the oldest known human DNA in the region. First excavated in the early 1990s from the &lt;strong&gt;Huseby Klev&lt;/strong&gt; site, this 10,000-year-old artifact was originally thought to be just another example of Stone Age tool-making material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But decades later, new DNA sequencing techniques have confirmed that this humble piece of prehistoric gum once passed through the mouths of three individuals — &lt;strong&gt;two women and one man&lt;/strong&gt; — providing genetic insights that were previously impossible to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Genetic Snapshot From Ancient Scandinavia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early Mesolithic period, &lt;strong&gt;birch bark tar&lt;/strong&gt; was widely used by hunter-gatherer societies across Europe as an adhesive in tool production. But its secondary role as a chewing gum may have been just as common. Researchers now believe ancient people chewed the bark either during downtime or while working, leaving behind invaluable traces of their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Human remains from this era in Scandinavia are exceedingly rare, and those that have been found usually contain poorly preserved genetic material. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0399-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published in Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at Stockholm University were finally able to unlock DNA hidden in the bark thanks to modern advancements. As researcher &lt;strong&gt;Anders Götherström&lt;/strong&gt; explained, “Much of our history is visible in the DNA we carry with us, so we try to look for DNA wherever we believe we can find it.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tracing Ancient Migrations through DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the preserved chewed material, they discovered strong links between the three individuals and ancient populations from &lt;strong&gt;Ice Age Europe&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, the tools found at the Huseby Klev site appear to have originated in Russia, offering dual evidence of prehistoric movement into Scandinavia from both the &lt;strong&gt;East European Plain&lt;/strong&gt; and Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous hypotheses about dual migration routes into the region. As &lt;strong&gt;Natalija Kashuba&lt;/strong&gt; of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo put it, researchers were “really impressed that archaeologists took care during the excavations and preserved such fragile material.” She described the breakthrough as “almost forensic research,” as scientists sequenced DNA from “mastic lumps” that had been discarded 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unlocking Ancient Lifestyles From Chewing Bark&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond migration patterns, this ancient gum has the potential to uncover intimate aspects of prehistoric life — including diet, health, and social structure. According to &lt;strong&gt;Per Persson&lt;/strong&gt;, also from the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, “&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/traces-unknown-human-tibetan-dna/" data-type="post" data-id="91243"&gt;DNA &lt;/a&gt;from these ancient chewing gums have an enormous potential not only for tracing the origin and movement of peoples long time ago, but also for providing insights in their social relations, diseases, and food.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although birch bark tar chewing might not seem unusual given its documented use as glue, its role in preserving genetic history is now beyond question. The two casts of the bark, which clearly show distinct &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/07/komodo-dragons-iron-teeth-new-discovery/" data-type="post" data-id="7030"&gt;teeth &lt;/a&gt;marks, reveal a brief but intimate moment frozen in time — one that offers modern science a rare glimpse into the people who once inhabited early Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;The menopause years aren’t just hot flashes and irregular periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Tiffini Sarver, 44, of Lincoln Square, said growing up these were the only two menopause symptoms she’d heard about from school health classes and watching her mom’s “really bad” experience with hot flashes. The air conditioner was always on, Sarver remembered. Otherwise, she said, no one ever discussed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarver expected menopause to be one event ending when the periods stopped after a few years of hot flashes and menstrual cycle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in her late 30s, she started having seasonal allergies that got progressively worse. Anxiety and memory issues followed. Sarver said her doctor confirmed her suspicions of menopause-related brain fog and allergies: “It blew my mind but made sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., Sarver is one of 75 million women in one of the three stages of menopause: perimenopause, menopause or postmenopause, with 6,000 women reaching the menopause milestone daily, according to the nonprofit Let’s Talk Menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s health experts attribute commonly held myths and misconceptions to the stigma of menopause, research gaps from inadequate funding and undervaluing women’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s not one menopause syndrome, or collection of symptoms, that every single person gets, that’s a myth,” said Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director of the The Menopause Society and director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80% of people get hot flashes, she said. Even then, symptoms can vary in frequency and intensity, if experienced at all. Some women are more sensitive to hormonal fluctuations and grapple with debilitating hourly recurrences; others may experience less bothersome flashes twice a week, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-floatleft&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarver, a finance and billing specialist, has never had a hot flash. She expressed surprise that symptoms could be so varied. While data is limited, emerging research supports that lower estrogen levels occurring around menopause can make sinonasal symptoms, such as allergies, worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s behind menopause misinformation?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of health care provider training, social media and inadequate research are core reasons for menopause misinformation, according to professor Pauline Maki, director of the Center for Health, Awareness and Research on Menopause (CHARM) at the University of Illinois Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maki attributed the training shortfall to the legacy of the 1990s Women’s Health Initiative study, which linked hormone therapy to breast cancer and heart disease. In turn, she said, medical schools stopped teaching about menopause and developing a pipeline of knowledgeable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking answers, she said women often go online. Maki warned, though, most social media accounts are influencers not recognized as medical experts in the field of menopause medicine: “That doesn’t align with the practice of evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, menopause research is an underfunded and underprioritized area of public health, Maki and other experts agreed. Doctors only receive on average two hours of perimenopause and menopause education, one study reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, actress Halle Berry joined Maki in Chicago to promote menopause awareness through public education and policy. At the event, hosted by the University of Illinois Chicago, Berry shared the story of her doctor misdiagnosing her perimenopause symptoms of pain from vaginal dryness as herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience spurred the actress to be an on-the-ground advocate for greater menopause research funding, quality of care and health care access for women navigating midlife — and the changes that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The menopause conversation remains stigmatized. “Periods are a taboo topic,” Christmas said, while Maki noted women are especially reluctant to discuss sexual symptoms with doctors, who frequently cannot answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly A. Lightford and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton are aiming to change that through policy: They backed state Senate Joint Resolution 25, which both chambers recently adopted, designating October 12-18 as Menopause Awareness Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myths unraveled&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s much to unpack about the menopause years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is the transitional phase that women’s health experts say can start up to 10 years before natural menopause, which happens after a year without a period, typically around age 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone fluctuations that begin during this transition can cause a constellation of symptoms including night sweats, sleep disruptions, heart palpitations and anxiety. Despite most every woman experiencing menopause if she reaches midlife, there’s frequent misconceptions surrounding what to expect — and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, leading health experts and women at different life stages weigh in on common menopause myths and share their personal journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Hot flashes, or night sweats, disappear after a couple years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot flashes affect some groups of women more than others. Research shows Black women experience symptoms on average 10 years compared to 6.5 years for white women and Latin women 8.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Diane Campbell, 62, of Western Springs, the first signs of perimenopause — brain fog, anxiety and mood swings — appeared at age 39. During her 50s, the “serious” hot flashes started — and continued postmenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell, a retired high school guidance and college counselor, recalled going to doctors, describing her angry feelings, sleeplessness and night sweats, and being told to take antidepressants: “And I wasn’t depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six doctors later, she found a gynecologist who understood her concerns and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Campbell began a hormone replacement therapy regimen of twice-weekly estrogen patches and vaginal cream for libido, chronic urinary tract infections and vaginal dryness — all symptoms that can continue beyond menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Valentine’s Day, she awoke to a gift: sleeping through the night without night sweats. The itchy skin and spiral thinking, also gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My quality of life has improved significantly. I feel like I’ve got my life back — and didn’t even feel like pieces were missing until I got on hormones,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: You can’t get pregnant during perimenopause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Traci Kurtzer, a gynecologist and nationally recognized menopause expert, said women can still get pregnant during the perimenopause transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasized that until officially menopausal, pregnancy is always possible. Even with low fertility rates, there’s a chance a released egg can be fertilized, she said. She acknowledged being surprised by “how many people still don’t realize that there is still a pregnancy risk in our 40s, and potentially early 50s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Hormone replacement therapy is the only option to ease menopausal symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Paula Neale, of Edgewater, entered perimenopause in her late 40s, life became an emotional roller coaster. She cried, got upset more easily and communication with her then-husband became strained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just didn’t seem to be myself,” said Neale, a commercial lease manager at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By her early 50s, she’d hit menopause and gained 20 pounds. She’d never before had to diet or exercise, and this new body frustrated her. In postmenopause, the hot flashes and night sweats emerged, and she repeatedly asked for hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors said she was “too old.” Since January, Neale, now 66, has found support at the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, she takes a daily non-hormonal prescribed pill, Veozah, to ease hot flashes and night sweats. She’s embraced her doctor’s words: “There is no reason for any woman to have to suffer menopause symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: If you have the BRCA gene mutation, hormones are off limits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with a BRCA gene mutation has an increased lifetime risk for breast and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t automatically make them off limits for using hormones,” Kurtzer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stressed the importance of people having individualized discussions with their doctors that include a risk assessment and review of prior medical treatments and potential benefits of hormone therapy to overall health. She attributed the myth to fear and misinformation of the connection between breast cancer and hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Menopause doesn’t start until 50s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal range of menopause is between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. Before the age of 45 is called early menopause, before age 40, premature menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early menopause is about 5% of the population, and premature menopause, depending on the source, is about 1% to 3% of the population,” Christmas said. It can be induced by surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or occur naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of younger women under 40 don’t realize some of the symptoms they’re having could signal early menopause, Kurtzer said. “They’re often dismissed by their physicians and being told, ‘Oh, you’re too young for this to happen to you,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But now there is a surprising rapidly growing market for it: middle aged women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson still puts in his protein shake to “put on size,” Ivanka Trump revealed earlier this year she takes a dose with her morning smoothie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From fitness influencers on TikTok to health experts, the chalky powder is now being touted for a range of benefits for &lt;a href="/topic/women"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;.

Creatine may also offer benefits tied to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine can help ease fatigue during your period by supporting stable energy levels,” Rupar continued, “especially when you’re feeling more tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate the menstrual cycle, influence how the body produces and uses creatine, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the menstrual cycle, creatine levels can change, and supplements may help keep energy and muscle function more stable, especially when oestrogen is low,” Rupar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 fcVRZz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-23363"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

have breached the fluids that surround eggs and travel with sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team led by Dr. Emilio Gómez‑Sánchez of Next Fertility Murcia in Spain scanned &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/follicular-fluid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;follicular fluid&lt;/a&gt; from 29 women and seminal fluid from 22 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found microplastics in 69 percent of the women and 55 percent of the men they studied. According to Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez, the team was surprised to find that the particles were so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-in-human-reproductive-fluids"&gt;Plastics in human reproductive fluids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study detected polymers such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polytetrafluoroethylene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polytetrafluoroethylene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adrecoplastics.co.uk/polypropylene-uses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polypropylene&lt;/a&gt;, materials better known for slick frying pans and food packaging. Seeing them next to human eggs turns a theoretical hazard into a measurable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2021, Italian obstetricians spotted twelve plastic fragments in every placenta they examined, confirming that particles smaller than five millimeters can cross the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33395930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maternal‑fetal boundary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly sized particles have been uncovered deep in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35364151/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt; removed during surgery, proving that inhalation is a realistic delivery route for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-tap-water-home-faucet/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands have even measured plastic mass circulating in human blood samples, an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35367073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that explains how fragments migrate to distant tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-plastics-enter-the-human-body"&gt;How plastics enter the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people take in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-human-brains-may-affect-mental-health/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; flecks by eating, drinking, or breathing, because everyday products shed invisible dust whenever they are heated, abraded, or exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once swallowed or inhaled, particles small enough can slip through the gut wall or the thin air‑blood membrane in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies suggest that fragments under one micrometer can enter cells directly, whereas larger shards get trapped in tissue and spark local irritation. Either way, they bypass the body’s usual waste filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory work on mice shows that digestive uptake rises when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/airborne-microplastics-where-they-come-from-and-where-they-go/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; hitchhike on fats, a detail that matters for fertility research because reproductive hormones ride on similar lipid highways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overlap raises worry that plastics may act as endocrine mimics or carriers for other chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez’s team avoided laboratory contamination by collecting every human sample in glass vials and verifying the absence of background plastic. This means the polymers they found were genuine residents, not stray lab dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-harms-fertility"&gt;Plastic harms fertility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice exposed to polystyrene fragments shed sperm with damaged DNA and sluggish movement, effects traced to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31896473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; that overwhelms antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36948006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on rodent Leydig cells shows shriveled mitochondria after nanoplastic exposure, which throttles testosterone production and shrinks litter sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews published in 2024 concluded that microplastics can disrupt the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38750730/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypothalamic‑pituitary‑gonadal axis&lt;/a&gt;, leading to hormonal imbalances and faulty egg maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because human oocytes develop over months, chronic exposure could matter more than a short spike. That makes the repeated detection of PTFE in both eggs and sperm especially noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-levels-in-eggs-and-sperm"&gt;Plastic levels in eggs and sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current data set, PTFE appeared in 31 percent of sampled egg fluid and 41 percent of semen. PP ranked second among women and &lt;a href="https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chemicals/polystyrene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt; second among men, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/a&gt; also present but in smaller numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual plastic output has climbed from under two million tons in 1950 to about 460 million in 2019, a 230‑fold jump documented by the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36969097/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Minderoo‑Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each uptick in production increases litter, weathering, and fragment release, tightening the feedback loop between plastics and people. Reproductive cells, delicate by design, stand on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gómez‑Sánchez reported that most reproductive samples contained only one or two plastic particles, amounts considered low compared with overall debris in the fluids. Yet fertility specialists note that even trace metals can derail embryo development, so particle counts alone may not predict risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-fertility-research-must-include-plastics"&gt;Human fertility research must include plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should be considered an additional argument in favor of avoiding the generalized use of plastics in our daily lives,” said Professor Carlos Calhaz‑Jorge of the University of Lisbon. He also noted that further research is needed to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team will now study hundreds of patients and link particle loads to embryo quality during &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in vitro fertilization cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Those correlations could supply the first direct human evidence beyond laboratory rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan lifestyle questionnaires to test whether habits such as heavy bottled‑water use or microwaving food in plastic correlate with higher particle counts. The approach could convert abstract exposure theory into personal advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are just one variable in a complex equation,” said Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez. He urges moderation of plastic use rather than alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-habits-to-lower-exposure"&gt;Simple habits to lower exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching from plastic bottles to glass or stainless steel lowers ingestion because heat and time no longer leach particles from container walls. Replacing scratched nonstick pans can cut PTFE flakes in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers advise skipping plastic cutting boards and using ceramic or bamboo instead, because knife action liberates shavings that cling to food. Letting take‑out cool before transferring it from polystyrene boxes also helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air purifiers with HEPA filters capture airborne fibers shed by synthetic textiles, a step especially useful for nurseries. Regular vacuuming with a sealed system keeps particles from resuspending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tweaks are not foolproof, yet they come with side benefits like removing chemical additives that ride on plastic dust. They buy time while science sorts out the clinical stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-efforts-to-cut-human-plastics-pollution"&gt;Efforts to cut human plastics pollution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health researchers argue that personal choices alone cannot outrun a supply chain making more than a billion pounds of new plastic every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiators at the United Nations are hammering out a global treaty that could cap production and streamline recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt; of Boston College calls the treaty a once‑in‑a‑generation chance to protect human health, because curbing output remains the only sure way to slow microplastic fallout. He points to the emerging fertility data as evidence that time is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether lawmakers act or not, the science of sub‑visible plastic is moving fast thanks to sharper imaging tools and nanomechanical sensors. Studies that once took months now finish in days, filling the literature with fresh clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every new dataset sharpens the same picture: plastics weather into dust, the dust goes everywhere, and living tissue keeps no closed doors. Eggs and sperm, it turns out, are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:32:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQSWRTV19pTUZhQ3lMYWpNOFBpRUMxeUF1clV3eU1fbTRQTkw5VERGRjBtaTJ0enVSZHVINlNtVU82OG1OdzVqQjcxNzQzSFRQN2xfRi14MHRxSHNNUzJUcnF0NS1kNjV1U2V2VjhZczZ1QjM3R3RJLUlDMDlvZV9wSW5yUGpqOXE2UHI3enQ1dw</guid></item><item><title>自闭症急剧上升背后的真相-以及为什么它可能是灾难性的， Rebecca Ker博士说-太阳报 | The truth behind a dramatic rise in autism - and why it could be catastrophic, says Dr Rebecca Ker - The Sun</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBIUWZMdENEbjJtQ1E5eDVTTTRXSG9yUENDTGxneGZPWDd0T3BqQXphcm1uN1hRZ3FrSUw2dC16dUhmblpmenA5SFZnQUdXbzNNd2NiZks3elJNMEtDZVcwb2xNRnF4SGRqdUcxOUFocGhLWmVHYmZ4VFI3V01KWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF you've spent any time on social media, you'll likely have come across videos titled “the signs you're autistic” and “why autism is to blame” for any number of behaviours or personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This content has become so prolific it's pushed thousands of people to seek an official diagnosis.

- a lifelong condition that affects how people experience and interact with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/influencers/" rel=""&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt; might have you assuming that number is far higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now 3.2million posts about autism on TikTok alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these are inaccurate, but it is true that diagnoses are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates are up 787 per cent in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/england/" rel=""&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; from 1998 to 2018, and experts warn the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nhs-crisis/" rel=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; is “overwhelmed” by the influx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Dr Rebecca Ker, a psychologist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council and co-founder of &lt;a aria-label="Carlton Psychology (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.carltonneurodevelopmentalservices.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carlton Psychology&lt;/a&gt; in Surrey who specialises in supporting neurodivergent people and their families, reveals what’s behind the dramatic increase - and why it could prove catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLIER this year, US Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" rel=""&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; promised a “massive” research effort involving hundreds of scientists to get to the bottom of what he calls an autism “epidemic”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet after more than 15 years working with autistic children, adults and families, the only epidemic I can see is one of fear-mongering and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve not suddenly “caught” &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/2798008/what-autism-symptoms-children/" rel=""&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;. Autism isn’t an illness. It doesn’t need a cure. It is a term that describes areas of difference - some disabling, some brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, autism rates have increased hugely - by 787 per cent in England over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6364075176112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="2E3rq3WEn" data-video-id-pending="6364075176112" data-brightcove-id="video_6364075176112_5067014667001-148869" id="video_6364075176112_5067014667001-148869" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Simple 10-question test that can help determine if you have autism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When autism was first discussed in the 1940s, it was thought to affect one in every 2,500 people. Today, research suggests it could be more like one in 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, that rise is down to our greater awareness and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/34500790/early-signs-autism-children-before-turn-one/" rel=""&gt;understanding of the condition&lt;/a&gt; and a broadening of the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/27089071/autism-test-adult-child-nhs-long-wait-diagnosis/" rel=""&gt;diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; we use to define it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, we’re better at realising the nuances and subtleties of the condition and the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/24313678/subtle-signs-you-might-have-autism/" rel=""&gt;broad spectrum&lt;/a&gt; of people who are autistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That greater understanding has also been informed by the autistic community themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some brilliant brains out there, advocating, educating, and finally being heard in a way they never were in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meet lots of parents bringing their children to clinics who are beginning to realise they might be autistic too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often they grew up with a very different understanding of what autism is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;THE NEW DEFINITION &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when the DSM-5 - the guidebook psychologists use to classify conditions - was updated in 2013, it removed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/4595413/asperger-syndrome-symptoms-signs-adults-children/" rel=""&gt;Asperger syndrome&lt;/a&gt; as a separate diagnosis and folded it into the wider autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder is currently defined as “persistent difficulties with social communication, social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour (including sensory difficulties), and it has to be present from early childhood to the extent that these limit and impair everyday functioning”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria is broad. For example “restrictive and repetitive behaviours” could look like lots of things, from rocking, hand-flapping and skin-picking to sticking to a strict routine or eating the same food every evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one person, difficulties with social communication might look like difficulties with picking up on the social cues of the person they are speaking to. For another person, it might mean being completely non-verbal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic minds often thrive on sameness, predictability and routine. They have a real need for sameness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the problem. While understanding has moved on, support systems are struggling to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest NHS England figures, covering the period ending March 2025, show the number of patients waiting at least three months for an initial specialist appointment has jumped by more than a quarter since last year. That figure has also tripled since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, nearly 124,000 under-18s are on the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/29763598/nhs-wait-list-rise-june-2024/" rel=""&gt;waiting list&lt;/a&gt; for over three months -  almost 30,000 more than the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="2"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration of a head-shaped outline made of crumpled paper with blue puzzle pieces inside." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="The diagnostic guidelines for autism have changed" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, (max-width: 660px) 620px, 940px" srcset="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=940 940w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1880 1880w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=2820 2820w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=3760 3760w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/paper-head-puzzle-pieces-autism-1007054357.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;The diagnostic guidelines for autism have changed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS guidelines say patients should be seen within 13 weeks. But nine in 10 wait much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those who did get assessed last year? They’d already been waiting, on average, a year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a diagnosis is often just the start… it doesn’t automatically unlock the necessary support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/surrey/" rel=""&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not unusual for children to wait years. That’s years of growing up without support and without understanding. Changing &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/schools/" rel=""&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;. Falling behind. Developing &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/20071753/therapist-signs-anxiety-treatments/" rel=""&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just children. Last year, the Oxfordshire Adult Autism Diagnostic and Support Service stopped taking new referrals altogether. Adults being referred at that time were told they’d have to wait 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of those families stuck on a waiting list, it can feel impossible. You’re worried, your child is struggling, and you’re being told to just wait and keep waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even without a diagnosis, there is support out there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article__quote"&gt;&lt;div class="article__quote-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don’t let schools tell you everything’s fine just because your child is quiet or well-behaved there. Masking is real and it’s exhausting. The children who cope at school often fall apart at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit t-p-color"&gt;&lt;span class="quote-credit"&gt;Dr Rebecca Ker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many end up seeking support privately, there are national &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/charity/" rel=""&gt;charities&lt;/a&gt; and helplines available too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families need faster access to specialists to provide clarity, tools, and reassurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who understands neurodivergence can help you notice patterns, validate your concerns, and work with you on practical steps that reduce &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32785587/banish-stress-burnout-busting-toolkit-health/" rel=""&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; and improve connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that your child is autistic, keep a journal of behaviours that concern you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Record exactly what triggers meltdowns, how you have noticed your child differs from their peers, how they respond to change, what their social interactions look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be as specific as you can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take that evidence to your child’s teacher or SENCO. Ask for support plans, even without a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak to your GP, or if your child’s under five, your &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/" rel=""&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; visitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;The key characteristics of autism - and why they go unnoticed &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content-img"&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" alt="" data-src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DD-27-03-autism_COMP.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;quality=100&amp;amp;w=620&amp;amp;h=413&amp;amp;crop=1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/author/alice-fullerthe-sun-co-uk/" rel=""&gt;Alice Fuller&lt;/a&gt;, Health Features Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODEL Christine McGuinness was a “recluse” for eight years and only left the house at 3am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springwatch presenter &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/21295274/chris-packham-autistic-took-own-life/"&gt;Chris Packham says it makes him a “task-centric workaholic&lt;/a&gt; who sees problems in everything he does”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And recently, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4003560/bella-ramsey-age-the-last-of-us/"&gt;Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; revealed they were diagnosed after struggling to wear thermals on the set of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/the-last-of-us/"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/autism/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and why does it &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/34093100/autism-core-characteristics/" rel=""&gt;seem so different in everyone&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leanne Cooper-Brown, neurodevelopmental lead at &lt;a href="https://www.clinical-partners.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Partners&lt;/a&gt;, tells Sun Health: “Autism is considered a spectrum, so not all people share the same traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whereas we used to think of autism as a linear line, we have come to realise that terms such as ‘high’ and ‘low’ functioning or definitions of ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ aren’t helpful and can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nowadays, we think of autism in terms of the strengths and needs of the individual, which can change over time depending on their environment and support network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 700,000 people in the UK are thought to have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/27089071/autism-test-adult-child-nhs-long-wait-diagnosis/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; - that’s one in 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But research by University College London suggests that number could be twice as high, as many people remain undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases are on the rise though. Figures released last year showed a 175 per cent increase from 2011 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Selina Warlow, clinical psychologist and owner of &lt;a href="https://www.thenookclinic.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Nook Neurodevelopmental Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, says: “Conversation around neurodiversity is becoming normalised, and that’s so positive to see. But more awareness is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving a diagnosis can open access to expert resources that support autistic people to thrive in society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism has long been associated with&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;social difficulties, like problems maintaining conversations and forming&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wellness/relationships/" rel=""&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But research published in the journal Cell Press suggested that repetitive behaviours - like rocking or finger-flicking - and special interests - whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; shows or specific &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/animals/"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; - are more indicative of an autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally though, experts say the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/24313678/subtle-signs-you-might-have-autism/"&gt;core characteristics&lt;/a&gt; include…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity &lt;/strong&gt;- autistic people can be much more or less sensitive to sights, sounds, textures, tastes and smells. For example, they find bright lights or crowded spaces overwhelming, Leanne says. They may also stand too close to others or need to move their whole body to look at something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimming &lt;/strong&gt;- to manage this sensory overload, some people use repetitive movements or sounds. “This is called stimming, and includes rocking, tapping and hand-flapping,” Dr Warlow says. “Though it’s something everyone does to some extent, those with autism are likely to engage with it as a form of self-regulation.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masking &lt;/strong&gt;- this is a strategy used by some autistic people, consciously or not, to match neurotypical people, Dr Warlow says. “It’s a way of hiding your true characteristics, and could involve copying facial expressions, planning conversations in advance, or holding in ‘stimming’ - swapping hand clapping with playing with a pen, for example,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burnout&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a state of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion and is a common feature in autism. “Being extremely tired, both mentally and physically, can be associated with the act of masking for a long period of time, or sensory or social overload,” Dr Warlow says. “Symptoms of autistic burnout include social withdrawal, reduced performance and increased sensitivity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social struggles&lt;/strong&gt; - socialising can be confusing or tiring for autistic people. They often find it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling, making it challenging to make friends. Leanne says: “In adults, autism may present as difficulties with interpreting social cues such as understanding body language or sarcasm, struggling to express emotions or preferring to be alone. This can impact relationships and work.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine&lt;/strong&gt; - many of us have a fairly regular daily schedule. But for autistic people, this becomes a “very strong preference for routine”, Leanne says.  This could be needing a daily timetable to know what is going to happen and when, or having rigid preferences about &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/food/"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; or clothing.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literal thinking &lt;/strong&gt;- some autistic people have a literal view of language - like believing it’s actually “raining cats and dogs” or that someone really wants you to “break a leg”. Dr Warlow says: “This can result in confusion with figures of speech, irony or indirect requests. “For instance, being told to ‘pull your socks up’ might be understood literally, not as a motivational phrase.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperfocus &lt;/strong&gt;- often associated with ADHD, hyperfocusing is also common in autistic people. “It’s where you’re able to focus intensely on an activity and become absorbed to the point of forgetting about time,” Dr Warlow says. “This is useful in work or hobbies but can result in neglect of other aspects of life, such as food or rest.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special interests &lt;/strong&gt;- we all have hobbies and interests, but for autistic people, these are so compelling they often want to spend all their time learning about, thinking about or doing them. “Special interests could include anything from dinosaurs to superheroes, and gardening to music,” Dr Warlow says. “These usually begin in childhood, but can also form as an adult. “Chris Packham is an example of an autistic person who turned his childhood special interest in animals into a successful career, becoming one of the UK’s best-loved natural world TV presenters.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don’t let schools tell you everything’s fine just because your child is quiet or well-behaved there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33495455/autism-saved-life-adhd-bullies-panic-attacks/" rel=""&gt;Masking&lt;/a&gt; is real and it’s exhausting. The children who cope at school often fall apart at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can afford to explore a private assessment, be cautious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are brilliant services out there, but it can be overwhelming choosing a private provider that is offering the best quality in terms of assessment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good autism assessment is a lot of work. It should involve a multidisciplinary team - not one person sitting with your child for half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialists should be Health and Care Professions Council registered. The process should follow National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should draw information from different contexts (observing your child themselves, talking to school, interviewing parents) and produce a detailed report that can stand up when you need it - for school support, Education, Health and Care Plans, or future care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="3"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="A mother assists her son with his homework." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="Dr Ker says parents are 'too often dismissed' when they raise concerns about their children" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, (max-width: 660px) 620px, 940px" srcset="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=940 940w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1880 1880w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=2820 2820w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=3760 3760w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mother-assisting-son-holding-push-1007054415.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;Dr Ker says parents are 'too often dismissed' when they raise concerns about their children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s stop talking about trying to “reduce” autism. That’s not the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we need to be building a more accessible world, where people can say: “I’m neurodivergent. I am more comfortable doing it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means changing how we run our education system and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as we build wheelchair ramps, and would view a lack of ramps to be unacceptable, we should be building sensory-friendly classrooms, alternative timetables, and flexible expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to train teachers to understand neurodivergent minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to provide the funding for more capable systems that can enable all types of brains to reach their potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, quiet girls or rule-following boys are told they’re “fine” while they suffer silently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, parents are dismissed as “overly anxious”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But often there are signs - a child who is exhausted after school, struggles with transitions, is inflexible in their play, feels different or confused by peers, complains the dining hall is too loud or smelly to be able to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;The 10-question autism test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;&lt;p class="article__content--intro"&gt;TO get an official autism diagnosis, you need to be assessed by a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you think your or your child might have the condition, there is a simple quiz called the AQ-10 that you can use to help support your suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/do-you-think-you-might-have-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;assessment tool&lt;/a&gt; — used by NHS doctors — does not confirm whether you are on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is used to screen people who might be. A version for children is also available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each question, write down if you 'Definitely Agree', 'Slightly Agree', 'Slightly Disagree' or 'Definitely Agree'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I often notice small sounds when others do not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I usually concentrate more on the whole picture, rather than the small details&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it easy to do more than one thing at once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is an interruption, I can switch back to what I was doing very quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it easy to ‘read between the lines’ when someone is talking to me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I know how to tell if someone listening to me is getting bored&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I’m reading a story I find it difficult to work out the characters’ intentions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like to collect information about categories of things (e.g. types of car, types of bird, types of train, types of plant etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it easy to work out what someone is thinking or feeling just by looking at their face&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find it difficult to work out people’s intentions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Score 1 point for 'Definitely Agree' or 'Slightly Agree' on each of items 1, 7, 8, and 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Score 1 point for 'Definitely Disagree' or 'Slightly Disagree' on each of items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you score more than 6 out of 10, a healthcare professional will consider referring you for a specialist diagnostic assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each question, write down if you 'Definitely Agree', 'Slightly Agree', 'Slightly Disagree' or 'Definitely Agree'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he often notices small sounds when others do not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he usually concentrates more on the whole picture, rather than the small details&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a social group, s/he can easily keep track of several different people’s conversations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he finds it easy to go back and forth between different activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he doesn’t know how to keep a conversation going with his/her peers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he is good at social chit-chat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When s/he is read a story, s/he finds it difficult to work out the character’s intentions or feelings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When s/he was in preschool, s/he used to enjoy playing games involving pretending with other children&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he finds it easy to work out what someone is thinking or feeling just by looking at their face&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S/he finds it hard to make new friends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1 point can be scored for each question. Score 1 point for 'Definitely Agree' or 'Slightly Agree' on each of items 1, 5, 7 and 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Score 1 point for 'Definitely Disagree' or 'Slightly Disagree' on each of items 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the individual scores more than 6 out of 10, they will be considered for a specialist diagnostic assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these on their own mean a child is autistic, but we should be sensitive to the clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With adults, the process is more complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t always have parents to describe childhood behaviours. But what we see again and again is this: they’ve been masking their whole lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve been told they’re too much, too blunt, too rude. They’ve often experienced long term difficulties with their &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/mental-health/" rel=""&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; or been misdiagnosed with personality disorders, anxiety disorders, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/eating-disorders/" rel=""&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulties with mental ill-health are more prevalent in autistic people. These are all signs that it is hard to be autistic in a world that is geared up for neurotypical people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve made it through work or university by sheer effort - but at a cost. &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wellness/24727350/signs-heading-for-burnout-work-ways-to-avoid/" rel=""&gt;Burnout&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/depression/" rel=""&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt;. Exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And often, the moment they receive that diagnosis? It’s a relief. At last, something makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;'Not everyone is neurodivergent, but everyone is neurodiverse'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, autism is a difference. But it’s a difference we’ve punished, misunderstood and ignored for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DSM-5 still calls it a disorder. But many autistic people find this term offensive and prefer the word “difference” or “condition”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I agree. It isn’t an illness. And there are many strengths associated with autism too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have different brains. Neurodiversity is a natural part of human variation - just like height or handedness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is neurodivergent, but everyone is neurodiverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Kennedy Jr says autism is worse than &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/" rel=""&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;, he isn’t just wrong - he’s dangerous. His words fuel a climate of panic, shame and disinformation. And for what? To blame &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/medicines-vitamins-vaccines/" rel=""&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;? To stir controversy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no medical basis for that claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what there is is a growing body of knowledge. Of compassion. And of people - autistic people -  finally being seen, heard, and supported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Sun</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:24:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBIUWZMdENEbjJtQ1E5eDVTTTRXSG9yUENDTGxneGZPWDd0T3BqQXphcm1uN1hRZ3FrSUw2dC16dUhmblpmenA5SFZnQUdXbzNNd2NiZks3elJNMEtDZVcwb2xNRnF4SGRqdUcxOUFocGhLWmVHYmZ4VFI3V01KWXc</guid></item><item><title>自美国宣布消灭麻疹以来，麻疹病例激增至历史新高- CNN | Measles cases surge to record high since disease was declared eliminated in the US - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOUVdZeGFjRGZLU0FFaU04Zk9MVXpSdWx2UWd2YlFrMlk1UGdaMmY2aGRlazM5eHRHSi01U2lVVzNkMmgwZzBuOEtISGVIZzU1ZXVObDQ2Y1dKU1UyR3RjYURNTzRzVjNlNWRMbFhfdFBHSTZ6SkFBeVZ3bjBKUXdfdm1QTlhRd9IBiwFBVV95cUxOTjZwRE94QXRPbk5CSWsyUWtYN3MzeGtnVEV4SlRzU1lubHhBYk5jT29tWXpDVkFSWmVQNmdvMGNWRzlNUWtWcWdiV2NsTXkxWUVaU0cxdmk4YkVQUUp0blNpMlFYRTRXTG5SdlJwSlNMNVA1T1hMQnM0VU9Xdm5wWFJvUTdTRkRSR204?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Falling childhood vaccine coverage and a large, smoldering outbreak that was kindled in an undervaccinated pocket of West Texas have driven the United States to a troubling new milestone: There have been more measles cases in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have been at least 1,277 confirmed cases of measles reported in the US in 2025, according to &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation. Just halfway through the year, the case tally has already surpassed the last record from 2019, when there were a total of 1,274 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600053b6mz9tcsdpg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this year’s cases are likely to be severely undercounted because many are going unreported. Three people have died from measles this year – two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated – matching the total number of US measles deaths from the previous two and a half decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600063b6m1x9vi8r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time. Reaching this status was “a historic public health achievement,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, possible in large part because of vaccine development. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600073b6ml1mxlwsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, there have been an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since the disease was declared eliminated, according to CDC data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600083b6m59sk5tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened elimination status; those outbreaks were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600093b6m12z6cerq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, the vast majority of measles cases have been in Texas, with more than 750 confirmed cases associated with one outbreak that started in late January. If cases associated with that outbreak continue to accumulate through January of next year, the US could lose its measles elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclzqcig00043b6me94k1xsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of those cases – more than 400 since the start of the year – have been in Gaines County, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;the state health department&lt;/a&gt;, where vaccination rates are well below the recommended level. In the 2024-25 school year, nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners in Gaines County did not have their required MMR vaccine, one of the worst rates in the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000d3b6mr6rd7glk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak, and cases reported in Kansas may also be connected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000e3b6mwlqq7hxx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Special &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/health/measles-wastewater-us-spread"&gt;vaccination clinics&lt;/a&gt; that have been stood up in response to the outbreak have led to additional coverage for thousands of people. Many of the affected counties have also introduced expanded vaccination guidance, allowing infants to get their first shot as early as 6 months old instead of waiting until 1 year. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm9daul00033b6mxtsnbbg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And a recent &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000f3b6m83kjht4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But as the pace of new cases associated with the West Texas outbreak has slowed, cases have continued to accumulate across the country. There have been at least 27  total outbreaks – defined as three or more related cases – and at least 38&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;states have reported at least one case this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000g3b6m38c8hbxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases rose quickly in Colorado last month when an out-of-state traveler flew while infectious, leading to multiple cases among passengers on the same plane, and others among people who were in the airport at the same time and broader community spread from those cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000h3b6mlz4c0a63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other cases among Colorado residents were linked to travel to Chihuahua, Mexico, where there is also a large outbreak concentrated among the local Mennonite population. There is another large outbreak happening in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to multiple cases in Michigan. At least one person has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/health/measles-deaths-canada-mexico"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; this year in Canada, and there have been nine deaths in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000i3b6muv2fb8p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The CDC has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000j3b6mr0910te8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 8% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC. At least 155 people with measles – about 1 out of every 8 cases – have been hospitalized this year, CDC data shows, and 28% of cases have been in children younger than 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclui2a300003b6mukid62r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is safe and extremely effective – one dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective – but measles is one of the most highly transmissible diseases in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0qgb00063b6mk2lk45wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0xzz00093b6mer3s8tyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000k3b6mtrrkcpf9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the measles case count reached its previous record in 2019 – under the first Trump administration – both the HHS secretary and CDC director at the time released statements emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcly58zc000j3b6mywfz9cp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the CDC still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;does not have a director, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines"&gt;long and complicated history&lt;/a&gt; with measles vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000l3b6mxl0cirjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, when there had been about 600 measles cases in the US, Kennedy made his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet – but it stood in stark contrast to years of work against measles vaccines. And last month, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; that has historically guided the federal government’s vaccine recommendations, a move that concerned public health officials across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000m3b6mh75ug94j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A) Generation B) Gigabyte C) Google D) Grid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X users were quick to respond with a lot guessing gigabyte wrongly. Others offered their own guesses including 'generator', 'God' and 'greed'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/sciencetech/article-14247371/Cellphone-radiation-warning-researchers-reveal-new-risk-factor-5G-networks.html"&gt;5G wireless&lt;/a&gt; is now commonly used for smartphones and is better than the other generations at connecting to multiple devices at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But - adding another convoluted layer - 10G is not necessarily faster than 5G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the two Gs represent different concepts and therefore are not evenly comparable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evolution of the G system started in 1980 with the invention of the mobile phone which allowed for analogue data to be transmitted via phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Digital came into play in 1991 with 2G and SMS and MMS capabilities were launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An aerial view of a cellular tower stands on the top of a hill in Larkspur, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The higher the number next to the G, the better the data, making 5G better than the earlier versions.

During the Covid pandemic, US researchers investigated&lt;span&gt; the effects of radio-frequency radiation generated by the ultra-fast mobile internet and revealed that it had negligible health impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/sciencetech/article-8510939/Scientific-study-confirms-5G-harmless-benign.html"&gt;The study &lt;/a&gt;came after several 5G masts were vandalized during lockdowns following unfounded conspiracy theories saying the form of wireless communication caused Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Theorists claimed the fifth-generation wireless standard emitted radiation that lowers the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite providing essential communications technology during the pandemic, 5G masts were subject to arson attacks throughout the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their research paper, published in PLOS ONE, the team wrote that the potential for health effects from higher radio-frequency radiation should be examined as concerns 'over their potential health impacts are ongoing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To learn more, researchers conducted experiments using embryonic zebrafish, an organism often used to discover interactions between potential environmental stressors and biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adult zebrafish in the lab. Around 70 per cent of human genes are found in zebrafish, according to scientists, which makes them well suited as lab models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experimental set up used in the experiments for the study.

Redweik had picked up a fungal infection, probably during a visit to Vancouver Island in mid-2016, and there was little doubt he now was near death: He was crashing into walls when he tried to walk and vomiting frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2CX37KMZ5CNRP3ZJOUANA52OI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“He was probably within a day or two of dying when he got to the hospital,” said Redweik’s wife, Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7OIGH5VHNFW3GA6SSOLYE3XSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was hospitalized from August to October while doctors blasted the fungus in his system with amphotericin. He&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;lost his hearing and went blind in one eye from the pressure of swelling on critical nerves. His kidneys were damaged by the medication. He couldn’t walk or even swallow, receiving nutrition through a feeding tube in his nose. A former competitive weightlifter, Redweik, who was 58 years old at the time, lost 63 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="REY2LD7PBBCNDFNH2SU67ZJSRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But after six weeks, the amphotericin seemed to have killed the fungus. Laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid began to run clear. He started relearning how to walk, swallow and take care of himself. On Oct. 17, he went home to continue recuperating, and a few weeks later, he attended his daughter’s wedding, even walking a few steps down the aisle with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SQ3T5C3EKJASLCRNQ6SWCFYCLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Four days later, though, while sitting on a couch at his home in Arizona, Redweik passed out. At a Tucson hospital, he complained of pain in his eye sockets. The pressure in his brain had soared, and a surgeon there installed a shunt in his head that routed the excess cerebrospinal fluid into his abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QNC3DD4MRB4HE6VMEUJ4XQ3IU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But soon, his ability to walk regressed and he lapsed into near-unconsciousness. More amphotericin seemed like the only choice. Yet cultures of his spinal fluid showed definitively the fungus was dead. What good would another round of “amphoterrible” do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R6IVR2V5Y5G7JNIUMO3HEIFJUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stumped by Redweik’s continuing severe illness, his doctor tracked down a specialist in fungal diseases at the National Institutes of Health who said he knew of cases like Redweik’s. Peter Williamson, chief of the translational mycology section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a hunch about how to treat Redweik. But Redweik needed to come to the NIH’s clinical center, the research hospital for severely ill patients where Williamson worked. Only then was Redweik’s condition identified and treated, saving his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Unbearable headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P23MVOZXYJBOPL4QQBNM7XOTNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When his crushing headaches began in the spring of 2017, Redweik gobbled over-the-counter painkillers and eventually visited the emergency room near his Green Valley, Arizona, home. There he received a common diagnosis for people in hot, dry climates: dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JDNPEEX4EZEDNKQKMQ46PZ73QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He and Joyce didn’t believe it. Redweik had once developed a blood clot in his calf, and they were concerned he had another in his head. They wanted an MRI, but the wait to see a neurologist was four to six months, and Redweik was starting a new job in Plano, Texas, leaving ahead of Joyce, who would join him later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YVDNFBJTFJDH7FHYSQJKQKMARY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, his condition worsened. The headaches were nearly unbearable and had spread down his neck. He began throwing up two or three times a day, and his gait was unsteady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKSCEW3SMZA7FOWJBSNPL4TYCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was like I was intoxicated,” Redweik recalled. “I couldn’t walk steadily. I was hoping people weren’t watching. It was like I was going to work drunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3KVVXRQNBFKDFWB5Q7KS33BII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During a visit a few weeks later, Joyce Redweik found her husband confused and disoriented. By August, Peter Redweik was falling down when he tried to walk. He needed a wheelchair.

But given his condition, Redweik was admitted to the hospital, where tests revealed &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000642.htm" target="_blank"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, which, left untreated, can be fatal. He began therapy with amphotericin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TVOMLTWLIJA2VE3JJS2EZ2P6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Redweiks had spent their adult lives in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, so it was unusual that Peter was infected by a fungus, &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus gattii&lt;/i&gt;, that thrives in a wet, temperate, forested climate. But they had visited Vancouver Island, which had such a climate, the year before, so perhaps that was where Peter was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4AXBY2J2GBGHRCIXZZGAMRZUXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With dangerous pressure building up in his brain, Redweik endured painful lumbar punctures to drain cerebrospinal fluid every few days. Eventually, that procedure was replaced by a lumbar drain installed in his lower back that siphoned off the fluid when the pressure grew too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWTLF3YMWREUXCCYND7WVUMQXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After six weeks, laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid were negative.

About 1,000 are HIV patients, another 1,000 are people with suppressed immune systems such as transplant recipients, and 1,000 are previously healthy people like Redweik. About a third of the 3,000 die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CFBJSDMU5FDMFFPDDOTWDRQHOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Redweik collapsed on his couch and was taken to the hospital again with what seemed like a relapse, his doctors were puzzled. Lab cultures of his spinal fluid showed no evidence of live fungus, but he still showed symptoms of severe meningitis. One test might be wrong, but not several. Should they ignore the results and try to kill the fungus again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJGVXO3OCNHELPFP423TMWDRUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a search for that answer, one of Redweik’s physicians found Williamson’s name online and contacted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7J6WTGD7JRC3HKEKALVKB7EBEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Williamson, a subset of the previously healthy patients suffer an autoimmune reaction after the fungus is killed: a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4825797/" target="_blank"&gt;post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome, or PIIRS.&lt;/a&gt; It is not unlike the inflammatory response that has produced long covid in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I7K2QRO56NFDLPJSPSVDRM6I2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Williamson was confident that Redweik was one of those patients and his immune system still considered the fungus a threat. It had amped up the various cells that attack invaders, focusing on tiny particles of the fungus — proteins it had released and cell walls that still remained in Redweik’s system after the cryptococcus was vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WS7AO25C7NEBNIW6QWQRPNAGSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That is what unleashed another round of inflammation and the new symptoms, Williamson theorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D6OBDNYWQFFATH6BV5FDAH6U4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was declining quickly when he arrived at the NIH, and Williamson put him on large doses of the steroid methylprednisolone to suppress the immune response, along with the antifungal fluconazole in case the cryptococcus fungus somehow flourished again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RD77MX2R5REUVNBM6HNZPIW5SY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It may be that microscopic particles of the fungus were still in Redweik’s brain, triggering swelling and pressure akin to his meningitis as the immune system attacked, according to Williamson. Or perhaps antibodies were able to travel to areas of the brain and produce generalized inflammation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GU2UBA56SZAFTJXO2H2JBJWIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It is so counterintuitive,” Williamson said. Doctors “treat again with amphotericin because they don’t know.” But “it’s the delay in diagnosis and the inflammatory response that kills you,” he said. “It’s the edema [swelling] that kills you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LAZGJSZ5IJDOJELFF4IPRZPL5U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about three days, Redweik began to respond to the steroids and his symptoms started to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUAIQBWBEJFCCSODN7KNYZJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The technology available at the NIH hospital for monitoring his immune response was critical to saving him, Williamson said. Advanced flow cytometry allowed doctors to rapidly identify the immune cells in Redweik’s spinal fluid and confirm Williamson’s diagnosis that he was suffering an immune response to the dead fungus, not a recurrence of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4LZXT4UYZFGPK5AU6UZPUMR4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After three weeks at the NIH, Redweik went through rehab again and returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJ44QXS63VGJNEFKO4VKUROSYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today he still has difficulty hearing, he remains blind in his right eye, and his legs are numb below the knees, he said. With Stage 3 kidney disease caused by the amphotericin, he may one day need dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LRYYZQIYRZESXBI2TWPDBPPG3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even with those deficits, Redweik has regained his weight and resumed the retired life he and Joyce had planned.

More than anything, she would like her husband to become the great father she knows he will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things have not gone smoothly, however. Since 2022, they have walked along the in vitro fertilization path together, an expensive journey that has caused them to wonder how they could continue to afford the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her sisters-in-law suggested they raise money through an online fundraising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I normally do things on my own and I don't usually ask for help, but this seemed like another way to raise whatever we can to pay for the treatments," said Megan Worthington, who lives in Bountiful. "We've paid attention to interest rates because we've thought about taking a second mortgage. But this seemed to be something that could work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Worthingtons set up &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-worthington-fertility-fight?attribution_id=sl:a08e9ce2-63d5-4f75-a760-0b37d9a68ac8&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1749573367&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c-amp14_t1-amp15_t3&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;v=amp14_t1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an account on GoFundMe*&lt;/a&gt;, originally asking for $8,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not alone. Between 2011 and 2015, 1,602 GoFundMe campaigns were created specifically to raise funds for IVF treatments. GoFundMe reports that more than $3 million has been raised for these campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although GoFundMe does not publicize a listing of IVF campaigns by state, the company confirmed that couples in Payson, Springville and American Fork have also created campaigns to raise funds for IVF treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Megan Worthington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, given the costs. The average cost for one IVF round of treatment in the U.S. is between $15,000 and $30,000, according to the Stanford for Economic Policy Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance rarely covers the cost of any fertility treatments, meaning that unless a couple has an extra tens of thousands of dollars available to them, they have to find ways to raise the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes IVF even more difficult to handle for many women is not only the cost of the treatment, but also the fact that there is no guarantee that they will have a baby in the end. In other words, a couple may go through the various rounds of treatments — creating embryos outside of the woman's body and placing them in the uterus — without a guaranteed formation of a fetus that will lead to a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pew Research Center continues to report that the number of women who use IVF services continues to increase, despite the costs, which also continue to rise. The organization states that one out of every 10 women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 has received some form of fertility assistance, including advice, referrals and medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Pew and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have investigated the connection between women having children later in life and the growing use of fertility treatments. What researchers do know is that one of every 42 babies born in the U.S. is a product of IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking fertility treatments can also be a struggle in a state like Utah, where families have more children than the national average. Women like Worthington, and others in Utah seeking IVF treatments, have found the entire endeavor frustrating, sometimes causing questions of self-worth and more. They often feel misunderstood by others, including some family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, this process for couples can be exhausting emotionally and for the women, physically, as well. Having friends and family who support the couple is important, as well as considering other ways to parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really want to be able to give my husband not just the experience of being a father and watching his child grow up, but also the different growth stages of pregnancy from hearing the first heartbeat, to the first kick and alien belly roll," Worthington wrote on the GoFundMe page. "I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington has a 13-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and has witnessed her husband loving the girl as his own. They have also considered adopting a child through the foster system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to be parents. And even though the path to get there has been a struggle, they know it will happen somehow. For now, they'll focus on raising the money and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I can only go through this until I'm 40," Worthington said. "We'll keep trying until then. My sisters-in-law have been really supportive and they've come up with things like having a garage sale. And I think the GoFundMe campaign can be very useful. This was a last-minute decision we made a month ago. This whole thing has been a roller coaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited into the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

"Just standing or walking after a meal can lower your blood sugar by up to 30%. Yes, it's that powerful." And no, you don't need to go for long walks. Ruchi recommends just a short stroll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, a 2022 &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/17034/#:~:text=Just%202%20minutes%20of%20walking%20after%20eating%20can%20help%20blood,It%20helps%2C%20too." data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Sports Medicine found that walking for just 2 to 5 minutes after a meal can significantly improve blood sugar levels. Even simply standing helps, though walking remains more effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Don't have time to walk after meals? Or stuck at a desk job that keeps you sedentary?" Ruchi offers a clever alternative: calf raises. "You can do them while brushing your teeth, sitting at your desk, or waiting for your food to heat up," she says. These small movements activate your lower leg muscles, especially the soleus, a powerful muscle that plays a big role in blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-sugar" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; is stable, insulin stays balanced and your body stays in fat-burning mode," Ruchi explains. "But when insulin spikes, your body stops burning fat. And over time, needing more and more insulin to do the same job can make weight loss even harder." That's why Ruchi emphasises the power of small, consistent habits. "Little changes like this may not seem like much, but they can lead to big results over time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Unlike in your bones, having calcium in your coronary arteries is a bad thing, because it indicates the buildup of plaque comprised of cholesterol, fat, and other lovely things. The higher the calcium score, the more plaque that has built up — and with it, &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/oct/calcium-score-what-is-a-cac-test-do-i-need-one/#:~:text=Wait%2C%20isn%E2%80%99t%20calcium%20a,future%20heart%20attack%20or%20stroke."&gt;the higher the risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease and even heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A couple of hours after the test, I received a ping on my phone. My CAC score was 7, which indicated the presence of a small amount of calcified plaque, &lt;a href="https://www.droracle.ai/articles/21304/agatston-score-how-to-interprete"&gt;which translates&lt;/a&gt; to a “low but non-zero cardiovascular risk.” Put another way, &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/about/procedures/tools/mesa-score-risk-calculator"&gt;according to one calculator&lt;/a&gt;, it means an approximately 2.1 percent chance of a major adverse cardiovascular event over the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;2.1 percent doesn’t &lt;em&gt;sound &lt;/em&gt;high — it’s a &lt;a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/a-priori-probability/"&gt;little higher&lt;/a&gt; than the chance of pulling an ace of spades from a card deck — but when it comes to major adverse cardiovascular events, 2.1 percent is approximately 100 percent higher than I’d like. That’s how I found myself joining the &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/do-statins-save-lives-doctors-dont-agree"&gt;tens of millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are currently on statin drugs, which lower levels of LDL cholesterol (aka the “bad” cholesterol). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I didn’t really want to celebrate my birthday with a numerical reminder of my creeping mortality. But everything about my experience — from the high-tech calcium scan to my doctor’s aggressive statin prescription — explains how the US has made amazing progress against one of our biggest health risks: heart disease, and especially, heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-dramatic-drop-in-heart-attack-deaths" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A dramatic drop in heart attack deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A heart attack — which usually occurs when atherosclerotic plaque partially or fully blocks the flow of blood to the heart — used to be close to a death sentence. In 1963, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_20/sr20_002acc.pdf"&gt;death rate from coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, which includes heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4830a1.htm"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt; in the US, with 290 deaths per 100,000 population. As late as 1970, a man over 65 who was hospitalized with a heart attack &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/06/heart-attack.html?ck_subscriber_id=2771385781&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Heart+attacks+no+longer+leading+cause+of+US+deaths+-+18114390&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=convertkit"&gt;had only a 60 percent chance&lt;/a&gt; of ever leaving that hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A sudden cardiac death is the disease equivalent of homicide or a car crash death. It meant someone’s father or husband, wife or mother, was suddenly ripped away without warning. Heart attacks were &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet today, that risk is much less. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, the proportion of all deaths attributable to heart attacks plummeted by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. Over the same period, heart disease as a cause of all adult deaths in the US fell from 41 percent to 24 percent. Today, if a man over 65 is hospitalized with a heart attack, he has a 90 percent chance of leaving the hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By my calculations, the improvements in preventing and treating heart attacks between 1970 and 2022 have likely saved tens of millions of lives. So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 1964, the year after the coronary heart disease death rate peaked, the US surgeon general released a &lt;a href="https://digirepo.nlm.nih.gov/ext/document/101584932X202/PDF/101584932X202.pdf"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; on the risks of smoking. It marked the start of a decades-long public health campaign against one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/cigarettes-and-cardiovascular-disease.html"&gt;biggest contributing factors to cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That campaign has been incredibly successful. In 1970, an estimated 40 percent of Americans smoked. By 2019, that percentage had fallen to 14 percent, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/smoking.htm"&gt;it keeps declining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reduction in smoking has helped lower the number of Americans at risk of a heart attack. So did the development and spread in the 1980s of statins like I’m on now, which make it far easier to manage cholesterol and prevent heart disease. By one estimate, statins &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2821%2900572-6/fulltext"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; nearly 2 million lives globally each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When heart attacks do occur, the widespread adoption of CPR and the development of portable defibrillators — which only began to become &lt;a href="https://www.aedleader.com/blog/history-of-aeds/#:~:text=The%20First%20Portable%20Defibrillators%20in,in%20UK%20ambulances%20until%201990."&gt;common in the late 1960s&lt;/a&gt; — ensured that more people survived long enough to make it to the hospital. Once there, the development of specialized coronary care units, balloon angioplasty and artery-opening stents made it easier for doctors to rescue a patient suffering an acute cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="our-changing-heart-health-deaths" class="_7ka5u2 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Our changing heart health deaths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite this progress in stopping heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;around 700,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; still die of all forms of heart disease every year, equivalent to 1 in 5 deaths overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of this is the unintended result of our medical success. As more patients survive acute heart attacks and &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/"&gt;life expectancy has risen as a whole&lt;/a&gt;, it means more people are living long enough to become vulnerable to other, more chronic forms of heart disease, like heart failure and pulmonary-related heart conditions. While the decline in smoking has reduced a major risk factor for heart disease, Americans are in many other ways much less healthy than they were 50 years ago. The increasing prevalence of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/hypertension.htm"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2731178"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; all raise the risk that more Americans will develop some form of potentially fatal heart disease down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here, GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic hold amazing potential to reduce heart disease’s toll. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/major-cvd-event-risk-cut-by-20-in-adults-without-diabetes-with-overweight-or-obesity"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that obese or overweight patients who took a GLP-1 inhibitor for more than three years had a 20 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to cardiovascular disease. Statins have saved millions of lives, yet &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127172/cdc_127172_DS1.pdf"&gt;tens of millions more Americans&lt;/a&gt; could likely benefit from taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/08/19/why-do-women-get-cholesterol-lowering-statins-less-frequently-than-men"&gt;women, minorities, and people in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Lastly, far more Americans could benefit from the kind of advanced screening I received. Only &lt;a href="https://rcastoragev2.blob.core.windows.net/3c9c26e329cc22b38adf73d92e6f530f/PMC8105517.pdf"&gt;about 1.5 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; received a CAC test in 2017, but clinical guidelines indicate that &lt;a href="https://www.journalofcardiovascularct.com/article/S1934-5925%2816%2930285-4/fulltext"&gt;more than 30 million people&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from such scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just as it is with cancer, getting ahead of heart disease is the best way to stay healthy. It’s an astounding accomplishment to have reduced deaths from heart attacks by 90 percent over the past 50-plus years. But even better would be preventing more of us from ever getting to the cardiac brink at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTXB2a0FseURhbDdCWEpEbVJzNjJQY3ZSRzAxaDJiTjFmYzNlcGJ0SWJTbUM0czR6QnJFUTJfMUN2RkRVcjA2VmdOSnhzcHlQZk5GSWZaazlUaFZqYU1yQkdBNzI3N2NvV2RZZXNLM1BjanBzMkZEcU9nNzRuY1hzSE9adE9GRDFreUZsbV9PSk1mVHlsV2E3MWlaQm12TldJdDV2TA</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，压力通过减少关键微生物代谢物来破坏肠道和大脑屏障- PsyPost | Stress disrupts gut and brain barriers by reducing key microbial metabolites, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNTF9HMURWaWZPdXNsaUZkZnJ2SkhMNEk1NmhKcjRoVFlZZFRfeW5pLVpiQ18yeHNCd0xnTEpjeWN1RkNKVVZSRm1rSTJoSUlfUHFfNGNramFtTjRUWjdvZFRkcVhwVkFqUUQ4ZFVVN0dmUk1nOVNwXzFwMGxmbk55M2dia1N4TUxUX19vTWJJNXhmME9BejhXYlYwb3BlTFFMV0tRek9JdU1pQi1FREt4WTc2TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reports that a single, brief exposure to stress is associated with a rapid reduction of beneficial compounds produced by gut bacteria. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266635462500050X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain, Behavior, &amp;amp; Immunity – Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that these same compounds, when tested in a laboratory setting, appear to protect the cellular barriers of both the gut and the brain from damage. The findings offer new insight into the immediate biological responses to stress, highlighting a potential mechanism through which even short-term stressors might influence our physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly interested in the gut-brain axis, the complex network of communication between the gastrointestinal system and the brain. This system includes not only nerves and hormones, but also immune signals and microbial products. One of the key components in this system is a group of substances called short-chain fatty acids, which are produced when gut bacteria digest dietary fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fatty acids—mainly butyrate, acetate, and propionate—can influence gut health, inflammation, brain function, and even mood. While much attention has been paid to how stress affects the body over time, less is known about how the gut and brain respond to short bursts of stress. The current study set out to examine whether acute stress changes short-chain fatty acid production, and how those changes might influence the function of protective barriers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have long been interested in the impact of stress on signalling in the gut-brain axis. This is a two-way street in that while gut microbes can tune the host stress response, stress exposures can also change the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Much less is known in this context about how acute stress, the building blocks of chronic stress, modify the gut. Essentially, we wanted to know what was going on in the stressed gut,” explained study author Gerard Clarke, a professor of neurobehavioral science at the University College Cork and co-author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/microbiota-brain-axis/foster/978-0-12-814800-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Microbiota Brain Axis: A Neuroscience Primer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers exposed mice to a 15-minute period of restraint stress. They used both conventional mice, germ-free mice raised without any gut microbes, and germ-free mice that had been re-colonized with gut bacteria. After the stress exposure, the team measured the levels of various short-chain fatty acids and other related compounds in the animals’ lower intestines. The researchers also tested the effects of these compounds on cellular models that mimic the gut and blood-brain barriers, which are crucial in preventing harmful substances from entering sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the animals exposed to stress, levels of butyrate and acetate dropped significantly in the lower intestinal contents, especially in conventional and colonized germ-free mice. These changes appeared quickly, within 45 minutes of the stress exposure. The researchers also found that stress reduced levels of dietary sugar breakdown products and other microbial metabolites. These findings suggest that acute stress disrupts the fermentation processes that gut bacteria use to produce beneficial compounds, which could have downstream effects on host health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the intriguing findings here is that the consequences of an acute stress exposure is visible in the gut very quickly as alterations in microbial metabolites,” Clarke told PsyPost. “These results build on earlier work from our lab to potentially explain how an acute psychosocial stressor can impact intestinal permeability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether these stress-induced reductions had functional consequences, the researchers turned to laboratory cell models. They applied varying concentrations of butyrate, acetate, and propionate to layers of gut and brain cells grown in the lab. The goal was to see whether these compounds could protect against barrier disruption triggered by lipopolysaccharide, a bacterial molecule known to increase permeability and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that certain concentrations of butyrate and acetate helped maintain barrier function, both in intestinal and brain cell models. For example, pretreatment with butyrate at 1 and 10 millimoles significantly prevented gut barrier damage, while acetate at 10 millimoles also had protective effects. Some concentrations of acetate, however, appeared to worsen permeability, indicating that its effects may vary depending on dose and context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective effects were linked to changes in tight junction proteins, which help hold the barrier cells together. One of these proteins, ZO-1, was reduced by the bacterial challenge, but this reduction was partially reversed by treatment with the short-chain fatty acids. Microscopy showed that butyrate and propionate increased both the abundance and structural complexity of ZO-1 proteins at the junctions between cells, forming wavy “ruffles” that may represent a more active or flexible barrier. In contrast, acetate did not increase ruffling but still helped restore overall protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how these fatty acids influenced the activity of receptors known to respond to them. Specifically, butyrate increased the expression of FFAR2 and FFAR3, two receptors involved in immune and barrier regulation. These receptors are believed to play a role in maintaining the health of the gut lining, and mice lacking them show higher permeability and more inflammation. The current results suggest that short-chain fatty acids may help stabilize the gut barrier partly by activating these protective signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at how fatty acids protect barrier function, the researchers also tried to understand why stress reduces their levels in the first place. By analyzing the breakdown products of dietary sugars in the intestines, they found that stress reduced the availability of key substrates that bacteria use to make short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also suggested that stress might shift microbial activity toward producing other compounds, such as polyols, or increase host absorption of fatty acids before they accumulate in the lower intestine. Some changes in microbial energy metabolism were also observed, depending on whether the animals had gut microbes or not. These findings point to a broad disturbance in the gut environment after stress, which could influence both microbial activity and the availability of beneficial compounds to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our gut microbes are like little factories, with production lines pumping out microbial metabolites,” Clarke said. “One of the key messages is that the experience of stress can also be felt by our gut microbes and one of the consequences of this is alterations in the production of these microbial metabolites, in this case a reduction in short-chain fatty acids. Our results using &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; models show that these microbial metabolites, like butyrate, are important to maintain gut and blood-brain barrier function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer new insight into how even short-term stress can alter gut-brain signaling, but the researchers acknowledge some limitations. The experiments used cell culture models to test barrier integrity, which cannot fully capture the complexity of living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies to understand if short-chain fatty acids could be effectors of intestinal permeability alterations in the gut and the brain, but these are a very simple approximations of what is happening at these sites in the whole organism within the context of microbiota-gut-brain axis signalling,” Clarke explained. “We &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-025-00749-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have recently noted&lt;/a&gt; that more sophisticated options like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a more innovative model to advance these studies in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that understanding how acute stress affects microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids may help explain how the gut-brain axis contributes to stress-related health problems. Since these metabolites are influenced by diet and microbial composition, they could become targets for new therapies aimed at supporting gut and brain barrier function during stress. For example, interventions that boost butyrate production or mimic its protective effects might help buffer against stress-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still need to understand what happens in the stressed gut when these acute stress exposures are experienced repeatedly and chronically, and if adaptive or maladaptive consequences emerge that will be important for stress-related disorders,” Clarke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is all down to the great work of a really talented postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Cristina Rosell-Cardona,” he added. “Cristina is now &lt;a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/inspire/#about-the-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an INSPIRE fellow&lt;/a&gt; at APC Microbiome Ireland and is going on to look at the impact of microbial metabolites in depression, a stress-related disorder with alterations in microbiota-gut-brain axis signalling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2025.100992" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Acute stress-induced alterations in short-chain fatty acids: Implications for the intestinal and blood brain barriers&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Cristina Rosell-Cardona, Sarah-Jane Leigh, Emily Knox, Emanuela Tirelli, Joshua M.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lung cancer cases are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lung-cancer-is-rising-in-non-smokers-and-this-could-be-why"&gt;&lt;span&gt;on the rise in non-smokers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; around the world, and air pollution could be an insidious, contributing factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A genome study has now found that outdoor smog and soot are strongly associated with DNA mutations related to lung cancer – including known drivers seen in smokers, and new ones unique to non-smokers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more pollution someone was exposed to, the more mutations scientists found in their lung tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings don't mean that air pollution is directly causing lung cancer, but they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;do contribute to evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-lung-cancer-might-get-started-in-people-who-have-never-smoked?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Geneticists Just Got Closer to The Sources of Lung Cancer in People Who Never Smoked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We're seeing this problematic trend that never-smokers are increasingly getting lung cancer, but we haven't understood why," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; biomolecular scientist Ludmil Alexandrov from the University of California San Diego (UCSD). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our research shows that air pollution is strongly associated with the same types of DNA mutations we typically associate with smoking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The extensive international analysis examined the cancer genomes of 871 individuals from four continents, all of whom had lung cancer despite never having smoked and who had not yet received cancer treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who lived in regions with high levels of air pollution were significantly more likely to have TP53 mutations, EGFR mutations, and shorter telomeres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abnormal TP53 and EGFR genes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/583929"&gt;&lt;span&gt;hallmarks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of lung cancers, especially those driven by the SBS4 DNA mutation, and shorter telomeres are linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-could-the-human-lifespan-get-the-answer-may-surprise-you"&gt;accelerated aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the current study, non-smokers who lived in areas with higher air pollution were nearly four times more likely to exhibit SBS4 signatures as those who lived in regions with cleaner air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, exposure to secondhand smoke, which is a known cancer risk, showed only a slight increase in genetic mutations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"If there is a mutagenic effect of secondhand smoke, it may be too weak for our current tools to detect," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Tongwu Zhang from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so for air pollution or tobacco smoking: both were strongly linked to DNA mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today in the United States, people who have never smoked or who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lives make up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;about 10 to 20 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of lung cancer cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have long suspected that air pollution could be a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-isnt-only-bad-for-lungs-say-studies-its-also-bad-for-mental-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;contributing factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but exactly how fine particulate matter in the air compares to tobacco smoking or secondhand smoke exposure remains unclear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies suggest that breathing polluted air is on par with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-can-be-as-bad-for-lung-disease-as-a-pack-of-cigarettes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;smoking a pack a day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet these conclusions are mostly based on observational analyses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current study digs further by looking at some of the molecular mechanisms that may be at play. It compared the lung cancer genomes of the 871 non-smokers with tumors from 345 smokers, to find similarities and differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The majority of non-smokers with lung cancer had adenocarcinomas (the most common type of lung cancer), and nearly 5 percent of those tumors showed the SBS4 mutational signature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, 28 percent of non-smokers showed a new signature called SBS40a, which wasn't found in t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;obacco smokers. Strangely, the cause of this particular mutational driver was unknown, but doesn't seem to be environmental in nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We see it in a majority of cases in this study, but we don't yet know what's driving it," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alexandrov. "This is something entirely different, and it opens up a whole new area of investigation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current research relied only on regional air pollution levels, which means it can't say how much any one individual was directly exposed to fine particulate matter in the air. Participants who said they had never smoked may have also smoked more than reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These limitations notwithstanding, the overall findings align with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyve-solved-the-enigma-of-how-air-pollution-causes-lung-cancer"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicating that soot or smog may trigger tumor growth in a similar way to cigarette chemicals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand regarding never-smokers," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; epidemiologist Maria Teresa Landi from the NCI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team now hopes to expand their study to include cancer genomes from a more diverse, global cohort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09219-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="204" data-end="561"&gt;If you’ve ever found yourself asking your cat whether she slept well or telling your dog he’s a “good colleague” while you both work from home, you’re in crowded company. Psychologists call the tendency to treat animals as if they possess human minds anthropomorphism. Far from being flaky, that impulse reveals a cluster of hard‑won emotional skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Well‑designed studies&lt;/a&gt; show that anthropomorphism is tied to stronger social bonds, richer imagination, and even measurable biochemical changes such as lower cortisol and higher oxytocin when people interact with their pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;Below are seven emotional strengths that research consistently links to people who chat with Rover as if he actually understands every word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="972" data-end="1021"&gt;1. Heightened empathy and perspective‑taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;Imagining an inner world for an animal forces you to practice walking in “someone” else’s shoes—literally a different species. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1391606/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology paper&lt;/a&gt; found that attachment to pets mediates a positive relationship between animal empathy and prosocial attitudes toward humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;In plain English: the same neural wiring that lets you wonder whether your dog is bored also fires when you wonder how a colleague feels. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9597799/"&gt;Meta‑analyses&lt;/a&gt; of anthropomorphism confirm that this habit of mind sharpens our ability to attribute emotions accurately to both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1681" data-end="1895"&gt;Over time, that reflexive perspective‑taking shows up as warm curiosity in friendships, quicker recognition of non‑verbal cues, and a reputation for being the person who “just gets it” without lengthy explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1902" data-end="1952"&gt;2. Superior emotional regulation under stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Talking aloud to a pet is a form of co‑regulation: you borrow the animal’s calm presence while narrating your own feelings. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-friend-who-keeps-you-young"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; highlights how simply stroking a dog reduces the stress hormone cortisol while boosting oxytocin, the same bonding hormone that quiets infants .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Because language labels emotion, giving voice to worries (“Buddy, I’ve had a chaotic day!”) helps the prefrontal cortex down‑regulate the amygdala’s alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2454" data-end="2680"&gt;People who habitually vent to their pets therefore practice a neurological loop of name it → calm it → re‑engage, which translates to quicker recovery from workplace friction and fewer sleepless 3 a.m. rumination sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2687" data-end="2728"&gt;3. Creative and imaginative thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2730" data-end="3315"&gt;Anthropomorphism requires mental flexibility: you are, in effect, writing mini fiction scenes every time you ask your rabbit whether she prefers kale or carrot. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/"&gt;Developmental psychologists note&lt;/a&gt; a positive link between children’s pretend role‑play and their tendency to attribute minds to non‑human agents &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Adults don’t lose that benefit; the 2018 &lt;em data-start="3119" data-end="3144"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; review on the “development of anthropomorphism” argues that the practice keeps the imagination muscles supple across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3317" data-end="3619"&gt;Creativity researchers describe anthropomorphic thinking as a low‑stakes sandbox for hypothesis testing: “What would a terrier CEO decide in this situation?” Those who keep that sandbox open often score higher on divergent‑thinking tasks and report an easier time brainstorming novel solutions at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3681"&gt;4. Nurturing attachment style and care orientation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;People who converse with pets display what attachment theorists call a secure base script—they assume their companion is available, responsive, and worthy of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8614365"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the human–animal bond suggest that anthropomorphic language often reinforces healthy caregiving behaviors and a nurturing self‑identity .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt; That attitude spills over: partners of devoted pet‑talkers report more supportive listening and practical kindness in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4180" data-end="4419"&gt;Importantly, the emotional strength here isn’t just kindness but consistency—the daily ritual of greeting the cat after work trains the nervous system for predictable caregiving routines, a key ingredient in building trust with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4426" data-end="4466"&gt;5. Healthy self‑compassion dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4468" data-end="4956"&gt;Listen closely and you’ll notice the words you choose for your pet are gentle, forgiving, and even playful—exactly the tone most of us struggle to use in our internal monologue. Therapists sometimes invite clients to “speak to yourself the way you speak to your dog.” &lt;a href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion"&gt;Emerging research supports&lt;/a&gt; the idea: a 2023 commentary on self‑compassion notes that mirroring pet‑directed speech can soften harsh self‑criticism and increase self‑acceptance &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;thementalwellnesscenter.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4958" data-end="5272"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10163869/"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; of nurses found that pet ownership predicted higher self‑compassion scores, suggesting the spill‑over effect isn’t merely theoretical. People who chat warmly to their pets rehearse that same warmth internally, buffering them against perfectionism and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5279" data-end="5342"&gt;6. Resilience against loneliness through micro‑connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5344" data-end="5756"&gt;Yes, some recent work warns that acquiring a pet isn’t a magic pill for chronic loneliness—but &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-power-pets-loneliness-social-isolation.html"&gt;programs that &lt;/a&gt;leverage pet interactions to build social bridges do show promise . The distinction is subtle: it’s not owning a dog that matters; it’s the social behavior that ownership sparks—smiling at other walkers, sharing funny “conversations” your parrot had at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5758" data-end="6083"&gt;Pet‑talkers excel here because they naturally weave narrative (“Charlie told me he prefers the park at sunset”) that invites others into dialogue. Psychologists call these narratives “micro‑bids” for connection. People who make them frequently cultivate denser social networks and bounce back faster when isolation threatens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6090" data-end="6145"&gt;7. Mindful presence and moment‑to‑moment awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6147" data-end="6511"&gt;Mindfulness is often taught through breath or body scans, but interacting intentionally with an animal can evoke the same state. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8300148/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; compared a brief mindfulness audio with a guided dog‑interaction and found both interventions equally effective at boosting momentary wellbeing and reducing mind‑wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6513" data-end="6840"&gt;When you crouch to your pet’s eye level and narrate what you’re both seeing (“Look at that fluttering leaf, champ!”) you anchor your attention to sensory details. Regular practice strengthens the brain’s default‑mode‑network control, improving focus back at the laptop and making you less susceptible to doom‑scrolling spirals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6847" data-end="6882"&gt;Putting the strengths to work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6884" data-end="7160"&gt;If you already greet your goldfish with “Morning, mate!” keep going—you’re running a daily emotional‑fitness circuit. If you feel silly, remember that the payoff isn’t about whether your pet grasps syntax; it’s about the skills you rehearse each time you anthropomorphize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7162" data-end="7389"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7162" data-end="7182"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7164" data-end="7182"&gt;widening empathy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7183" data-end="7220"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7185" data-end="7220"&gt;labelling feelings to soothe them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7221" data-end="7253"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7223" data-end="7253"&gt;flexing imaginative thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7254" data-end="7286"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7256" data-end="7286"&gt;reinforcing nurturing habits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7287" data-end="7316"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7289" data-end="7316"&gt;cultivating self‑kindness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7317" data-end="7350"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7319" data-end="7350"&gt;sprinkling social invitations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7351" data-end="7389"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7353" data-end="7389"&gt;grounding attention in the present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7391" data-end="7720"&gt;Take those strengths outside the living room. Try using the same gentle tone on yourself when a project stalls, or the same playful storytelling to lighten a tense meeting. And if you’re still on the fence about chatting to your pet, you now have seven research‑backed reasons to pull up a chair and ask the cat how her day went.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers continue searching for ways to prevent or delay Alzheimer's, leading to new findings on how routine adult vaccinations might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="vaccines_linked_to_lower_alzheimer_s_risk"&gt;Vaccines Linked to Lower Alzheimer’s Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Kristofer Harris and Yaobin Ling, with senior author Paul E.

The analysis compared vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, focusing on vaccines such as Tdap/Td, shingles (HZ), and pneumococcal immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: people vaccinated with Tdap/Td were 30% less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-turn-coffee-waste-into-a-weapon-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, shingles and pneumococcal vaccines showed a reduced risk of 25% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_vaccines_may_protect_the_brain"&gt;How Vaccines May Protect the Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe several mechanisms could explain this protective effect. Vaccines might reduce overall inflammation in your body or help your immune system fight infections that could otherwise speed up cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Schulz explained this theory clearly: "We and others hypothesize that the immune system is responsible for causing brain cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's. The findings suggest to us that vaccination is having a more general effect on the immune system that is reducing the risk for developing Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding further, Avram Bukhbinder, MD, co-author of the study, suggested vaccines might alter how your immune system reacts to the buildup of harmful proteins in your brain, characteristic of Alzheimer's. "Vaccines may change how the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-space-travel-on-the-human-immune-system/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; responds to the build-up of toxic proteins that contribute to Alzheimer's disease, such as by enhancing the efficiency of immune cells at clearing the toxic proteins," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="importance_of_vaccination_data"&gt;Importance of Vaccination Data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study utilized advanced analytical tools and large-scale healthcare data to ensure robust and reliable results. Yaobin Ling pointed out the significance of this approach, stating, "It's particularly encouraging to observe consistent results across numerous large-scale healthcare databases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Paul E. Schulz, MD, the Rick McCord Professor in Neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, was senior author of a study that found several vaccinations were linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. (CREDIT: UTHealth Houston) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xiaoqian Jiang, PhD, another key researcher from McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics, highlighted the role of these extensive data sets, stating they "gained valuable insights into which vaccines may protect against Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of these findings is further emphasized when compared to current Alzheimer's treatments. Existing therapies involving anti-amyloid antibodies slow &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-ai-finds-a-cause-and-treatment-candidate-for-alzheimers/"&gt;Alzheimer's progression&lt;/a&gt; by about 25% to 35%. This vaccine-based prevention strategy, offering similar or even greater risk reduction, highlights a powerful and accessible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_tdap_and_td_vaccines"&gt;Understanding Tdap and Td Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tdap vaccine protects you from three diseases: &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-skin-cancer-vaccine-dramatically-boosts-survival-rates-in-male-patients/"&gt;tetanus&lt;/a&gt;, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Tetanus bacteria live in soil and dust, entering your body through cuts to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Diphtheria, a bacterial respiratory disease, leads to severe breathing problems and heart issues. Pertussis is highly contagious, causing severe coughing fits, especially dangerous for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Results of a risk regression model on a) Tdap/Td, b) HZ, and c) pneumococcal vaccinations, stratified by three different ages (65, 75, 85) as measured at baseline.

Health authorities recommend Tdap for adolescents around age 11 or 12, and it’s essential for adults, especially pregnant women, during each pregnancy. Td booster shots are necessary every 10 years to maintain immunity or after severe injuries if your last dose was more than five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristofer Harris emphasized the broader public health significance of their findings. "Our findings are a win for both Alzheimer's disease prevention research and for public health in general, as this is one more study demonstrating the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/left-or-right-arm-new-study-reveals-why-vaccination-site-matters/"&gt;value of vaccination&lt;/a&gt;," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_path_forward"&gt;A Promising Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study strengthens the argument for routine adult vaccinations beyond traditional disease prevention. Alzheimer’s disease remains incurable, but preventing it by using accessible healthcare measures like vaccination provides hope.

Every child of a parent with Huntington’s — such as my two sisters and I — has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AF77L5PNLVBFFPBDHC7XREV5OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unlike conditions where you may not get the disease even if you carry the gene, if you test positive for Huntington’s, you will almost certainly develop it at some point. At-risk people can find out whether they have the gene through a testing process that includes a blood draw and appointments with trained genetic counselors who are available to discuss the process and the results before and after the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YJ2HR3FXC5FIDPAZTG4ZKG2DI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 27, Lindsey decided to take this step.

First, he lost 30 pounds and would use a walker. Then, he lost another 40 pounds and had to be pushed around in a wheelchair.

She was pretty sure she wanted kids, but without knowing her diagnosis, she couldn’t make any decisions about that, either.

She reached out to family members we had fallen out of touch with to hear stories about our dad before he was sick. She made dark, offhanded comments like, “Well, I might be dead by then,” or, “I won’t be around to see that, anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UDIW326CKRF4VEV3D6CAZMEDUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other times, you could sense her relief at knowing.

But not everyone does. In fact, you can have “silent celiac” and have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, GI specialists explain what silent celiac is, how it’s diagnosed and treated and what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is silent celiac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Silent’ celiac disease is when someone has celiac disease, a reaction to the gluten protein, but they do not manifest symptoms from the disease,” said &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/rabia-a-de-latour" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rabia De

Latour&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “They can have the physical manifestations of the disease like small bowel inflammation but without the GI symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the form of celiac often called “silent” celiac can also be referred to as “asymptomatic” celiac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare form of celiac, as usually patients develop GI symptoms from the malabsorption, which is secondary to the intestinal damage caused by the celiac disease,” said &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/kevin-m-cronley-md" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kevin Cronley" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68669baee4b0d0f8dcccdff4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body"

class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of silent celiac presumes you have no symptoms of the disease, some people might simply not realize they’re experiencing mild symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For probably a portion of those patients who think they have no symptoms, they discover that they did have symptoms and feel much better once they go on a gluten-free diet,” said &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/k/kastenberg-david-m" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. David Kastenberg" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68669baee4b0d0f8dcccdff4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/k/kastenberg-david-m" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. David Kastenberg&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at Jefferson Health in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They weren’t aware that they had symptoms because they thought things like headaches, joint aches, chronic sinus problems or muscle aches were just part of their normal everyday life rather than celiac.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it diagnosed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this manifestation of celiac disease does not involve clear symptoms, many people go undiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac disease is underdiagnosed, and physicians should have a low threshold to test for it if there are any laboratory abnormalities suggestive of celiac, family history of celiac disease, or other conditions which celiac can be associated with,” Cronley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he noted, further inspection of lab abnormalities are typically the way people with the disease wind up with a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone might have silent GI symptoms but may have abnormal lab findings or nonspecific generalized symptoms like fatigue and headaches,” De Latour noted. “Going to your doctor for regular checkups with appropriate blood work can pick up the lab work signs of celiac before your symptoms might. Someone might have blood work findings suggesting they are not absorbing certain nutrients well from their food due to the gut inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient’s bloodwork shows iron deficiency or elevated liver function, for instance, doctors may then check for celiac by doing a blood test for certain antibodies, like tissue transglutaminase antibody. They can also do an upper endoscopy to look at the GI tract and take a sample of tissue from the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac might be ‘unsilenced’ if someone is getting an upper endoscopy for something separate like acid reflux and the findings suggest celiac, leading them to go on and do blood tests,” Kastenberg said. “People also need to take notice when someone is at a higher risk for having celiac, like having a first-degree relative with celiac or concomitant medical problem like autoimmune thyroid disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that conditions like type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome and certain skin rashes are also associated with increased risk of celiac disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is there’s a clear and effective treatment for celiac disease, silent or otherwise. The bad news is it calls for a big lifestyle change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet,” Cronley said. “Gluten is a protein that is found in wheat that the body will confuse with the lining of the patient’s intestines, causing damage to the intestines. This intestinal injury can result in symptoms of malabsorption, vitamin deficiencies, and can increase the risk of cancer of the small intestine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remove this harmful protein from the equation and reduce the inflammation, patients must completely cut gluten out of their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For sicker patients, there are more intense therapies, but this is less common,” De Latour noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s now more awareness and understanding around gluten-free eating than in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gluten-free diets are popular right now because in general, people feel better on a gluten-free diet by eating less processed foods,” Cronley said. “If you think you may have celiac, seek an evaluation by a physician who can properly evaluate you for the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get the celiac diagnosis, it’s important to make those dietary changes, even if you don’t feel symptoms after eating gluten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

If you feel terrible when you have gluten, you get that feedback that you shouldn’t eat that thing. But if you aren’t so sensitive and can eat gluten all the time without feeling it, you aren’t getting that feedback that it’s a problem for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you need to recognize that silent celiac should be taken just as seriously. Ignoring it can lead to long-term issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you feel well, your small intestine is not well,” Kastenberg emphasized. “It’s not functioning properly, and there are lots of potential consequences like an increased risk for osteoporosis, nutritional deficiencies, malignancies and even reproductive and pregnancy-related issues like low birth weight or spontaneous abortion. If you have celiac, it’s important to tell your family members to get screened as well. Catching it early makes a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQXzQ3Rm94T3VOUVVWM0JiZlJ5Nnh5dHpMRjl4eUpIb1FUdmMyc2JERlllcE1Eei12bTdJcG45QzZQQzBGQ19GMXI0QnNqZ1NVTFppV2pzTlFSVWtMZmJYRlA5bW1ObHRYbFQzVjFnWFk3bEZORXY2bmU1TXhCUGJqVjlveDdPZnFfMGdvVnl1VG1JUHVMSUctWGxZVk15Nk9IWjlPM1RGd1UwTm_SAbABQVVfeXFMTlVnenY1cUVic3A5cHROVTNiZnBWMGhZZzFiNUFqakM1MG5oeVpQOUhfMmI5dS0wb1M1LUtud0g3TDAtV25GRGZnbWN4dWJpMk1BTUVnS3hBYTRvVzROLWM5b3B3R2dfT1FNT0JjS2VUNzdNa0dOZHJJX2ZfY09GUUJuUU81bURGV0hBclptTWxWNUQzQXhzb0IyUVhoTWxEc3FGQ2thUWJIazFlS3dqZFY</guid></item><item><title>喝汽水可以帮助偏头痛吗？医生揭示气泡饮料是否能治愈头痛-福克斯新闻 | Can drinking soda help migraines?

Sipping soda, particularly Coke, is said to cure migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does it really work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/americans-told-avoid-coffee-extreme-heat-warning-3-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICANS TOLD TO AVOID COFFEE DURING EXTREME HEAT WARNING IN 3 STATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kay Kennis, a general practitioner in England and a trustee for the Migraine Trust, pointed out that caffeine is the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;main substance in sodas&lt;/a&gt; that may help some migraine sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The caffeine in Coke can act as a nerve disruptor, [as] a substance that affects nerve activity," the expert told Fox News Digital. "For some, that disturbance works in a positive way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caffeine in soda can act as a nerve disruptor, which may provide some migraine relief, one expert said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennis added, "There are some painkillers that people take for migraine that have caffeine - and some do respond well to that - but we don't fully know why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can be a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management/headaches-and-migraines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;trigger for migraines&lt;/a&gt; as well, said the doctor, who advised that too much caffeine consumption can cause "a worse situation in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/why-red-wine-more-likely-give-you-headache" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY RED WINE IS MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU A HEADACHE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blake Livingood, a doctor of natural medicine (DC) based in North Carolina, also noted the impact of caffeine during an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can impact blood flow to the brain, he said, which may provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Caffeine can constrict blood vessels and change blood flow to the brain."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caffeine can constrict blood vessels and change blood flow to the brain, which might help if your headache is related to dilation of those vessels," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the idea that soda actually cures or prevents migraines - no, it doesn’t."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Watermelon can give you good electrolytes and improve blood flow, especially if you sprinkle a little salt on it, which also happens to taste great."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingood also acknowledged the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/viral-mcmigraine-remedy-has-some-rushing-mcdonalds-headache-relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral "McMigraine" remedy&lt;/a&gt; that claims sipping Coke and eating McDonald's fries is an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at those ingredients - salt, caffeine, and sugar - they can have an impact on blood flow to the head," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Migraines impact tens of millions of Americans, leaving many people reaching for soda to help relieve their pain.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That’s partly why grabbing fries with your soda sometimes seems to help. The salt in the fries, the sugar and the caffeine combined can change circulation and electrolytes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said there are much healthier ways to get those benefits, ranging from fruit to nuts to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;organic coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organic coffee is a better caffeine source," Livingood recommended. "Watermelon can give you good electrolytes and improve blood flow, especially if you sprinkle a little salt on it, which also happens to taste great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;health expert&lt;/a&gt; has also seen success in using magnesium to prevent migraines. He said electrolytes and sodium are key components in prevention and recovery as well, in addition to potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of reaching for soda to provide caffeine during a migraine headache, an expert recommends trying organic coffee.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingood also advised migraine sufferers to try mined salt and sea salt instead of regular table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any form of salt can impact blood flow and electrolytes, but there are better sources," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sprinkling good-quality salt on watermelon or nuts or even adding a pinch to your water is a healthier way to get those minerals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norbert Heuser, an entpreneur and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;author of the book&lt;/a&gt; "Coffee Addiction &amp;amp; Caffeinism," also told Fox News Digital he doesn't recommend relying on sugary beverages for migraine relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sugar content in soda makes it an unhealthy option for migraine sufferers, said one expert.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Migraines are complex and often tied to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/ask-doctor-can-dehydrated-even-not-thirsty" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;inflammation, dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, toxins like heavy metals and chemicals, or even environmental stressors such as EMF [electromagnetic radiation] from cell phones, WiFi and other sources," the health and wellness advocate said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heuser added, "The high sugar content and artificial additives in sodas and energy drinks can actually make these underlying issues worse over time.
