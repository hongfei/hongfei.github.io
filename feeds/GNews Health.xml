Making even small tweaks to the proteins that make up the shell stopped the virus from replicating as quickly, which suggested that drugs that affect the protein shell could prove to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was these insights that caught the attention of Gilead Sciences, prompting the company to search for drugs that target HIV's protein shell — otherwise known as a capsid — tapping Sundquist as a consultant and eventually leading to the development of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug itself binds the viral protein shell of HIV, preventing it from assembling properly and productively entering the nucleus of host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more potent than any drug available, but more importantly, it's very long-lasting. So what the Phase 3 clinical trials show is that it completely protects people from transmission for six months," Sundquist said. "There are still 1.3 million new infections worldwide, and this could really change that trajectory. Of course, the rollout has to be funded and be successful, but right now there's no reason to think this won't have a major impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, lenacapavir is noteworthy due to its potential for preventing HIV entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, about 40 million people live with HIV and the virus is responsible for 600,000 deaths annually, according to data from the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa and Uganda — two HIV hot spots — not one of the more than 2,000 women who received a dose of lenacapavir contracted HIV over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenacapavir almost completely prevents the transmission of HIV into at-risk populations," Sundquist said. "This is just an amazing result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approving the drug is just another notch in Sundquist's belt, as he was also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/2025-warren-alpert-prize-honors-scientists-whose-discoveries-culminated-novel-hiv-treatment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 Warren Alpert Prize from Harvard University last week. In April, Sundquist was named as one of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51296173" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's&lt;/a&gt; 100 most influential people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view ourselves as sort of the feedstock for new ways of approaching medicine," Sundquist said. "We're driven by curiosity to discover things that we don't understand. And I think that's not so different from other kinds of adventurers. The same thing that drives people to discover or climb mountains, I think, drives us to discover how a molecular machine works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent success, Sundquist remains driven, saying the work on HIV is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need a vaccine. That would be even better because then you could give everyone the vaccine and protect everyone, not just at-risk individuals," Sundquist said. "That's been a very difficult problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

In December of last year, the U.S. Surgeon General released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advisory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; warning about the direct relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer. Around the same time, new research challenged long-held beliefs about the safety of moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.23-00283" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Tim Stockwell and colleagues found that even low levels of alcohol consumption are linked to increased mortality. Dr. Stockwell later estimated, in media interviews, how this risk might translate into days or years of life lost depending on drinking level. He told the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13605039/Exact-number-alcohol-shortens-life-expectancy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that consuming just two drinks per week may shorten your life by three to six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, for frequent imbibers, the numbers get even bleaker. According to Dr. Stockwell’s comments to the media, if a person were to drink seven alcoholic beverages a week (beer, wine, or spirits), they risk cutting their life expectancy by two and a half months. A person who drinks 35 alcoholic beverages a week could shorten their life by two years, based on his interpretation of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stockwell told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that these numbers are averages, and some people could end up luckier than others. He discouraged people from considering alcohol as something that is okay or even healthy to consume in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; defines moderate drinking as one drink or less per day for women and two or less for men. For years, moderate drinking was considered okay, if not beneficial. However, Dr. Stockwell's research—and a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; he co-authored, which analyzed 107 studies from over 40 years—disputed that belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Stockwell’s review of years of research really challenges the old idea that a little alcohol is good for you. What he and his team found is that even small amounts of alcohol can shorten your lifespan," &lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Raj Dasgupta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis tells &lt;em&gt;Delish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dasgupta explains that both how much you drink and how often you drink impacts life expectancy. And as drinking increases, he says there's a greater risk to long-term health, such as liver problems, cancer, heart disease, and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol’s effect on each person is different. My advice: if you do drink, try to keep it in moderation," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:43:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE52M0dYeFROUnRmYWVQYUd6cXpaekphZjB2bjhyY1BjNE8zU2g3Ml9tUXNyaGdZMkVYRXNXbVhWS2ZUT1hFWnhuRnB3Qy1HOTRIMzRoUC1FaGUzTmFNS1Z2d2dlMVlfdFAteUlkUTFCVXUxcUhUSUcxMEJ0Yw</guid></item><item><title>严重的床虱感染蔓延到Coolidge Corner公寓大楼- Brookline。新闻 | Severe bedbug infestation spreads through Coolidge Corner condo building - Brookline.News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTUhqZDhyakhmRjA5V0FacTBoMFAxUlJzNkx5djFCQzBVNnFSTlNJWVdDcjF4M05vemwxdUxHZlF4ZkhyZEgwYW1UU1MzRW9MbElNb2FNUllsTmRaQ1J3eVZkLVU0dGdEWkdxbm40d2F6eXpoTERFZC1qSEJqcVR5dDhoV0JaVk56UHVPMFhsd0YyTUZMMi13ZVE0d0o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="nv-content-wrap entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A severe bedbug infestation in a condominium complex near Coolidge Corner has been festering for weeks, leaving residents frustrated and alarmed at the situation, and at the slow process of fixing the problem through the health department and the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 100,000 bedbugs are living in a condo in the Concorde Condominium complex at 50 Green St., and the infestation is so severe that the bedbugs have spread to at least eight of the other 59 units in the building, according to residents and court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One resident, whose condo now has bedbugs and asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, had a bite that became infected. The resident has since healed from the infection, but still has about 40 bites on his body, he told Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bedbugs do not carry disease, cohabitating with them is less than ideal, the resident said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mid-article-subscribe" class="do-not-print"&gt;&lt;div id="mid-article-subscribe-hdr"&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-h3"&gt;Get the latest Brookline news free in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="bdn-sub-inst"&gt;All fields required. You may unsubscribe at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just sleeping at night knowing you’re getting eaten alive is unsettling,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigalle Reiss, Brookline’s director of public health and human services, said the owner of the unit where the infestation began also suffers from hoarding disorder, worsening their living conditions and making it even more difficult to address the bedbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person was named in court documents, but Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News is not disclosing their identity to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of factors makes this case “one of the worst” she’s seen in her 23 years of experience in local public health, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult enough to treat bed bugs in normal situations. It’s even harder when there’s this amount of debris,” she said. “Until this is remediated it’s going to be a real struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concorde Condominiums residents filed their first complaint of bedbugs to the Brookline Public Health Department on April 30, Reiss said. The department investigated the unit on May 7, and it was later inspected by Dewey Pest and Wildlife, a pest control service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conditions are best described as deplorable,” wrote an entomologist from the pest control service in an assessment of the unit. “Most inspectible surfaces and items in the unit have been heavily contaminated by bedbugs and their feces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entomologist also recommended that a disaster remediation service should be hired to clean and decontaminate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condo was deemed “unfit for human habitation” on May 12, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 14, the health department ordered the resident to vacate the unit, Reiss said. After that, the process transferred out of the health department’s hands and into the court’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remediation process has moved at a much slower pace than residents would like — and now, more than a month later, the problem remains unresolved, residents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were hoping the health department would clean it out … or help us out by enforcing their order of condemnation, which they have not done,” said the resident who had an infected bedbug bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really up to the condo association and their legal process to get the order enforced,” Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://brookline.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Order-on-PI-6.4.25.pdf"&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt; filed on June 4 required the resident with the severe bedbugs case to “clean and restore” the condo to liveable conditions and to hire an extermination service for the bedbugs by June 11. The resident did not abide by the court order by June 11, so the Condominium Trust may legally enter the condominium and take steps to clean and restore it, according to the court order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Plaintiffs intend to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Court’s Order, and to avail themselves to the rights and relief afforded thereunder, as may be necessary and appropriate, and to the extent authorized,” wrote Jennifer Barnett, an attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, in a statement to Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town’s attorneys are also in “close communications” with another attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Brookline.News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:22:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTUhqZDhyakhmRjA5V0FacTBoMFAxUlJzNkx5djFCQzBVNnFSTlNJWVdDcjF4M05vemwxdUxHZlF4ZkhyZEgwYW1UU1MzRW9MbElNb2FNUllsTmRaQ1J3eVZkLVU0dGdEWkdxbm40d2F6eXpoTERFZC1qSEJqcVR5dDhoV0JaVk56UHVPMFhsd0YyTUZMMi13ZVE0d0o</guid></item><item><title>“多毛蛙”在海底漫步，用诱饵捕捉晚餐- Earth.com | "Hairy frogfish" walk on the seafloor and use lures to catch dinner - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPeFV6TWFtOTQtQlpYcDl1NTBSekctaXRDNHJtVE5jcW1pWElBSHVrVWJHTXlxTl9MUFVUSlFvZFZRSDFTSnM1RXpSTzZ2dFJGM1hxYkxvNnd2cC1hZnJLZ3hhS2lhXzZQOVMyMERJcUd0TnJrMEdIb1ZWX2dqdUZ6Zmw3MHptQVV4QWFGS0xoN3UxSlNmRnhTekVvSUhEYlMxanY3ek15ZlNkZW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hairy frogfish looks more like a tuft of drifting seaweed than a hunter. Yet beneath the mop of filaments sits an anglerfish that can inhale prey faster than most cameras can blink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine ecologist Dr. Maarten De Brauwer of &lt;a href="https://research.csiro.au/environomics/our-people/early-career-researchers-separate-bios/dr-maarten-brauwer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Curtin University&lt;/a&gt; first noticed that the fish’s lure shines neon orange under blue light, while the rest of the body stays dull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team’s 2016 field &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1493-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; on Philippine reefs linked that glow to free‑swimming worms that share the same color and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-hides-by-copying-reef-textures"&gt;Hairy frogfish hides by copying reef textures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hairy frogfish belongs to the anglerfish &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogfish-lure-their-prey-with-a-built-in-fishing-rod-and-bait/"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of lurking in the deep it prowls coral rubble in tropical shallows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coat of branching spinules lets it copy the texture of algae, sponge, or coral until the head seems to vanish into the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals can swap pattern and shade within weeks, shifting from lemon yellow to mottled black as sediment, light, and growth change around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rapid makeover is a textbook example of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519323002801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Batesian mimicry&lt;/a&gt;, a tactic where harmless looks discourage predators while inviting unsuspecting prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sight alone does not give the trick away, because even the fish’s eyes carry radiating stripes that obscure the pupil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the stubby “arm” formed by the first dorsal spine, called the &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/illicium-zoology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, rises above the camouflage like a tiny fishing pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-glowing-lure-helps-the-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How the glowing lure helps the hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These observations indicate a novel function, prey capture, for biofluorescence in coral reef fishes,” wrote De Brauwer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under daylight the &lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt; ends in a dull worm‑shaped tassel, but blue‑filtered lamps reveal intense &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59528-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biofluorescence&lt;/a&gt; that converts blue light to orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea fits a wider pattern, because a survey of 180 fish species found &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glowing pigments&lt;/a&gt; clustered in cryptic reef lineages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; ichthyologist &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/john-s-sparks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. John Sparks&lt;/a&gt; noted that “biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coral‑reef lineages,” hinting at communication or hunting value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By matching the fluorescent worms that drift over sandy bottoms at night, the lure likely acts as a living decoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sea-anglerfish-defy-evolutionary-expectations/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; twitches the tip in arcs and pulses that copy the jellied plankton’s swim, drawing curious gobies and cardinalfish within lunging range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fastest-strikes-on-record"&gt;Fastest strikes on record&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a victim lines up, the mouth opens twelve times wider than its resting size, pulling in water and prey through rapid &lt;a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/striated-frogfish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suction feeding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High‑speed videos have timed the attack at just six milliseconds, making the frogfish one of the quickest predators recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That burst happens because elastic ligaments around the jaw store energy while the fish crouches. Releasing the latch snaps the head forward, creating a pressure wave that drags prey inward before the target knows it moved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stomach then stretches like a balloon, letting a four‑inch frogfish swallow a meal almost twice its own length. Mouth, stomach, and even gill covers reset within minutes, ready for the next ambush without swimming far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-lives-without-swimming"&gt;Hairy frogfish lives without swimming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frogfish seldom swim, preferring a slow shuffle powered by limb‑like pectoral and pelvic fins. The gait looks clumsy, yet it lets the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-frog-day-2025-protecting-natures-tiny-guardians/"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; creep through branching corals or over sponges without stirring mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fishbase.se/summary/Antennarius-striatus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FishBase&lt;/a&gt; records show the species from New Jersey to Brazil and across the Indo‑Pacific, at depths ranging from tide pools to 720 feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults settle below 100 feet where wave surge is gentle, but juveniles often lurk among shore grass beds that teem with shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males change color during courtship, trailing females to the surface where a buoyant ribbon of up to 288,000 eggs drifts free. Larvae hatch in open water and later drop to the bottom, beginning the camouflage dance anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean"&gt;What the findings mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aggressive mimicry allows a predator to masquerade as something harmless to approach prey,” wrote marine zoologist &lt;a href="https://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/44.3/299.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John E. Randall&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressive mimicry, where a predator disguises itself as the prey’s food, shows up in a handful of reef hunters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluorescent lure adds a light signal to that illusion, effective only for animals with visual pigments tuned to blue and green. Future lab tests will measure how often fish reject non‑fluorescent lures compared with glowing ones, refining ideas about sensory ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these cues may also improve non‑invasive survey methods that use fluorescence to spot cryptic species on night dives. Conservation teams already trial blue‑light transects to count seahorses and pipefish that vanish under white lamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How to protect hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antennarius striatus&lt;/em&gt; sits on the &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16406979/115354869#assessment-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IUCN list&lt;/a&gt; as “Least Concern,” but habitat loss threatens local populations on polluted coasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors sometimes trawl adults for the aquarium trade, yet demand remains modest compared with bright reef staples like clownfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting rubble fields and sea‑grass beds will likely benefit the frogfish alongside countless small invertebrates. Marine parks can also restrict night fishing with lights that might interfere with fluorescent signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizen scientists armed with blue torches contribute valuable sightings through photo databases.

'Over time, that kind of stimulation might delay how quickly symptoms progress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe that a 'moderate' emotional response bolsters the connection between parts of the brain, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2521856/Listening-pop-music-help-people-severe-brain-injuries-recall-memories.html"&gt;improving people's memories&lt;/a&gt;. But too big or too small a response showed signs of weakening these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;An emotional response to music manipulated to elicit different moods helped people remember images of people doing everyday activities that they were shown before the songs played (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The more emotionally affected the 130 college students felt while listening to carefully selected music, the better they remembered images they had seen beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'Music activates the brain’s limbic system, which processes both memory and emotion,' Dr Kimberly Idoko, neurologist and medical director at Everwell Neuro, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The more emotionally activated someone is, the more the brain flags that moment as worth storing. That’s why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers played music gathered for the study by searching emotional keywords like ‘sad,’ ‘happy’ and ‘calming’ on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They chose three songs per category, designed to trigger emotions after having a separate group rate them for pleasantness, familiarity and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants then completed a memory task sorting 128 everyday objects as ‘indoor’ or ‘outdoor’ - a subtle way to test recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a 30-minute break, participants repeated the memory task with 192 images - some old, some new - to measure both general and detailed recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, they listened to music, neutral sounds (like crackling fire) or silence for 10 minutes while filling out mood and wellness questionnaires, followed by 20 minutes of quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;While the total number of people diagnosed is relatively small, the diagnosis rate of early-onset dementia and Alzheimer's disease is increasing, especially in younger age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they completed the memory task again, sorting images as old or new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Music successfully prompted an emotional response at differing levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sorted participants into minor, moderate or significant emotional responses after the listening session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a moderate emotional response to the music performed better on the last memory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, people with either very low or very high emotional responses had poorer memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more emotionally activated someone is, the more the brain flags that moment as worth storing,' Dr Idoko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences. And why, when an emotional response is more moderate, the brain has more bandwidth to encode the details.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study compared memory in college students, its findings could benefit Americans over 65 who are more likely to experience dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Projected yearly incidence of dementia on the basis of current rates (solid lines) and projected incidence of dementia assuming continuation of a decreasing trend (dashed lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Every state except one has seen a surge in Alzheimer's fatalities between 1999 and 2021, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults who have not been diagnosed with dementia might still begin to exhibit signs of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 12.2 million Americans are living with mild cognitive impairment - a possible stepping stone to Alzheimer’s that involves memory lapses and mental slowdowns noticeable to the person and those around them, but not severe enough to disrupt daily routines. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain is particularly adept at storing memories of events or phases of one’s life where music played a prominent role, improving their ability to recall memories of those events when that music plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be music they know. Past research has shown that patients can recall personal memories in greater detail even when they listen to unfamiliar music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yelena Sokolsky, a home health nurse and founder of Galaxy Homecare, told the Daily Mail that music therapy is especially valuable for people with early dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As cognitive functioning declines, individuals may struggle with verbal communication - this can lead to feelings of heightened confusion, fear or agitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, music can evoke emotion and memories, bringing comfort even when other forms of communication become challenging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Britta Reierson, a family physician and obesity medicine specialist in at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.knownwell.co/britta-reierson"&gt;Knownwell&lt;/a&gt;, told DailyMail.com: 'If an individual is experiencing side effects that increase the risk of dehydration, and at the same time are exposed to environmental impacts such as a heat wave when the need for hydration is higher, dehydration can occur much more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heat waves cause increased sweating as the body tries to cool down and maintain a normal body temperature. This additional fluid loss, combined with fluid loss from nausea, vomiting and reduced intake, can lead to severe dehydration and heat related illness if not properly managed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,200 Americans die from heat-related causes every year, though officials note the actual number could be 10-fold higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, about one in eight Americans - around 40million - has reported taking a GLP-1 agonist at some point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is released after eating, to slow digestion and increase feelings of fullness. In turn, this leads to eating - and drinking - less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandip Sachar, a dentist at Sachar Dental in New York City, said while 'this effect is more pronounced with food emptying, it can also slow the emptying of liquids.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 receptors are found in the lamina terminalis, a region of the brain that senses thirst and regulates water balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs may bind to those areas to decrease feelings of thirst, though research on this mechanism is still early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar said: 'Slowing of GI emptying may reduce hunger and also may prevent thirst. Patients have told me that when they feel full, it is more difficult to drink a lot of water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking Ozempic or similar drugs for obesity are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney disease, all of which raise the risk of dehydration, Dr Reierson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These conditions may reduce thirst and lead to retention and other fluid imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian and founder of the Better Nutrition Program, also told DailyMail.com: 'When you are taking a medication that slows gastric emptying, dehydration is a concern because the stomach acid and digestive juices, as well as overall metabolism and digestion and elimination, require optimal hydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kavin Mistry, a neuroradiologist and longevity expert, also pointed to common GLP-1 side effects like nausea and vomiting as a cause of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When fluid is not being replaced efficiently, the risk of dehydration increases, particularly in warmer weather when water needs are already higher,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, eating less food overall also decreases fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Reierson told this website: 'We often forget that food contributes to our daily water intake and eating less can lead to lower hydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Summertime favorites like watermelon, cucumbers and tomatoes are more than 90 percent water and can help boost fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar also recommends chewing sugar-free gum to increase saliva production, which can stave off dehydration, and steer clear of acidic foods and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr Reierson added: 'I don’t recommend that patients at higher risk for dehydration stop or not take a GLP-1 medication, however, it is important to exercise extra caution and work with your healthcare provider to ensure a comprehensive plan and strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mistry recommends people on weight-loss drugs set reminders to drink water regularly, even if you're not thirsty, and steer clear of drinks like caffeine and alcohol, which are dehydrating.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For healthy adults, the risk of illness after being licked by a pet that receives regular veterinary care is negligible. But when dogs and cats lick people with weak immune systems, serious infections can follow. Here’s what to know about why pets do this, and when you should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do dogs and cats lick people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZDDHADUUFG2NDT677G6MOGI4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/pet-ownership-statistics/"&gt;More than 60 percent of U.S. households&lt;/a&gt; include a pet, for good reason: pet ownership reduces loneliness, depression and anxiety. Rustin Moore, dean of the veterinary school at Ohio State University and &lt;a href="https://www.rustinmooredvm.com/about"&gt;author of an upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; on the human-animal bond, says this bond “has a profound power to heal, comfort and connect us; it is one of the most underutilized tools for improving human well-being.” Animal-assisted therapy is increasingly used in schools, nursing homes, hospices, prisons and hospitals, with benefits that include reduced pain perception, more rapid recovery from surgery, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106503/"&gt;improved emotional skills&lt;/a&gt; in children with disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6A4TOJAJOZHJNLRQGXVRY3AEZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Licking is a common behavior in pets. In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7345801/"&gt;2020 study from Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, hand-licking by dogs was reported by 86 percent of owners — and face-licking by 50 percent of owners. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18390853/"&gt;a study in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, more than 50 percent of people said their dogs licked visitors, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGDY7YA3WBCSFP3Q5C2MU3PGJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Animals lick other animals for many reasons. New moms lick their babies to clean and protect them (saliva has certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849090332X?via%3Dihub"&gt;antibacterial properties,&lt;/a&gt; which also could explain why animals lick their wounds). Animals also lick one another during “social grooming,” a bonding behavior that is particularly common in cats. A dog may lick humans to show &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22644113/"&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt;. And — given the opportunity — pets will meticulously lick skin that has traces of food or salty sweat on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJURIOWXZJBQFGW4B3DDYWWR4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it’s reinforced by positive social interactions (such as petting and a soothing voice), licking also can be a way to get attention. Genetics, other environmental influences, and age also influence licking behavior — in the U.K. study, younger dogs were more likely to lick people than older dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Are there germs in my pet’s saliva?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q24DCCUYCBEV7EZ7D4PTCKHE2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In short, yes. Despite saliva’s antibacterial effects, a pet’s mouth harbors billions of bacteria just waiting to infect humans when introduced into open wounds. Within this “bacterial soup” are two organisms with tongue-twisting names and a special ability to cause severe human disease: &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga canimorsus&lt;/i&gt; (capno-sigh-toh-fah-gah canny-morse-us), a long, rod-shaped bug; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida &lt;/i&gt;(par-stew-rella mul-tee-sigh-dar), a tiny oval-shaped bug. Although I wish these organisms had nicknames, they don’t — so I’ll just call them &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;here (recognizing that there are other &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; species that are not important causes of human disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DBPD2XHQHFDPRN3GXI4CTMIFU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you own a dog or cat, you probably live with these germs — they’re found in most healthy dogs and cats. &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; inhabits the mouth of more than 70 percent of dogs and 55 percent of cats, whereas &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is found in more than 50 percent of dogs and more than 70 percent of cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do doctors worry about these two bugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2O4XOPFOZFURFGC3BVQ6VSP34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although rare, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;infections are concerning, because they progress rapidly, and up to one-third of infections can be fatal. Within just a few days of a lick or bite, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; can multiply in your blood and cause critical organs to fail. These infections are also hard to diagnose, because &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; grows slowly in the laboratory. The most severe form of infection — a gruesome gangrenous skin condition known as purpura fulminans — has a mortality rate of 60 percent. Survivors often face amputation of fingers, toes or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EKDWCRLAMNBV3MP423GWUVRU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; infections are more common, because &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is frequently involved in bite wound infections (think of it as the common cat bite bug). Much less often, serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections follow licking, especially in babies or people that allow pets to lick open wounds or medical devices. With increasing animal ownership and advancements in human medical therapy, reports of &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27544345/"&gt;knee and hip replacements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32192435/"&gt;peritoneal dialysis&lt;/a&gt; systems and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687004/"&gt;long-term vascular access devices&lt;/a&gt; are increasing. “We have seen serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections that arose after cats — especially kittens — chewed on and contaminated dialysis equipment,” says Natascha Tuznik, an infectious-disease physician at the University of California-Davis. “Such equipment should always be kept away from pets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How often does licking lead to serious infections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGPVMPRWCNHFRHFZ2NXORKNNHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While bacteria like &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;are very common in your pet’s saliva, it’s incredibly rare for people to get sick after being licked. Every year, millions of bloodstream infections occur in North America and Europe, but fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;than 600 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;infections and just 20 cases of purpura fulminans&lt;/a&gt; have ever been reported. Infections from licking are most likely to occur in infants, pregnant people, people over 50, or people with conditions such as AIDS, cancer, alcoholism, diabetes or organ transplants. Tuznik notes that “people who lack a functioning spleen are particularly susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; infections and are specifically advised to avoid being licked by pets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How can I reduce the chance of infection from licking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EE4LK3UWJERLC5IWIHBDMZIOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wash your skin with soap and water after being licked. Avoid sharing food dishes and utensils with your pet (no more fork feeding!). Prevent pets from licking open wounds or medical devices. And people in high-risk groups should limit contact to snuggles instead of smooches. If you (or people you care for) have a weak immune system and illness develops, tell your health care provider about any known animal contact. When doctors know which bacteria to suspect, the result is earlier treatment, faster recovery and fewer complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="46ADBWOPHVEN3BL2N47PNQ6NZA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="46ADBWOPHVEN3BL2N47PNQ6NZA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;I’m immunocompromised.

Remember, pet ownership can ease the emotional burdens often experienced by people with chronic illnesses. Even if your pet licks you, the chance of infection is minuscule. Talk to your doctor and veterinarian about ways to minimize the risk based on your specific health condition or life stage while keeping dogs and cats by your side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDV5WYP4CZHI7OAFBE2ZJ63EQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jane Sykes is a Professor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California-Davis.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from a group of scientists led by Queen Mary University of London, published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/increased-risk-of-provisional-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd-among-females-with-attentiondeficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-crosssectional-survey-study/CD1DC6B31D4B009AB04F580C1189BC86" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; found that women with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be at higher risk for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;PMDD is characterized by severe emotional (e.g., depressed mood), physical (e.g., fatigue), and cognitive (e.g., difficulties concentrating) symptoms that occur in the days before menstruation. PMDD is a serious mental health condition that is associated with severe outcomes, including an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Thomas Broughton, a postdoctoral researcher, and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, a senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, collected online questionnaire responses from over seven hundred women in the UK. The questions asked about individuals' ADHD diagnosis and symptoms, PMDD symptoms, and co-occurring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared ADHD and non-ADHD groups and found that women with a clinical ADHD diagnosis were over three times more likely to meet criteria for PMDD than those without. Women who had high levels of ADHD symptoms and impairment (even if they did not have a diagnosis from a clinician) were also over four times more likely to have PMDD. The risk for PMDD was highest among women with ADHD who also had a depression or anxiety diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that women with ADHD, and especially those with ADHD and depression/anxiety, may benefit from PMDD screening. This is the case even if they don't have a formal ADHD diagnosis but have high ADHD symptoms and impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, who supervised the project, said, "Because ADHD was historically considered a condition that mainly affected boys, many issues specific to females have been overlooked, including associations between ADHD and times of hormonal change. Our findings emphasize the need to consider issues affecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult women&lt;/a&gt; with ADHD, and more specifically how females with ADHD may be at higher risk for experiencing PMDD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Broughton added, "Our findings also suggest that further research is needed to improve understanding of the link between ADHD and times of hormonal change, including the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/menstrual+cycle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and to reduce health inequalities and diagnostic bias in women and girls with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team includes Dr. Thomas Broughton (Queen Mary University of London), Dr. Ellen Lambert (King's College London), Dr. Jasmin Wertz (University of Edinburgh) and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais (Queen Mary University of London).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, feeding mice this type of diet before the onset of their disease modestly worsened certain visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ketogenic diets have been proposed to offer anti-inflammatory benefits to people with MS, the findings suggest the type of fat used may be a critical factor when considering such diets as a treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We present new data that the use of [the ketogenic diet] in the treatment of MS should take the composition of the [the ketogenic diet] into consideration,” the researchers wrote in the study, “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1587760/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A high-saturated, long-chain fatty acid ketogenic diet negatively impacts visual and motor-sensory function in a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by immune-mediated damage to the brain and spinal cord, which gives rise to various &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first signs of MS is &lt;a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/about-ms/signs-and-symptoms/eyes-and-sight/optic-neuritis"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;, or inflammation of the optic nerve that carries signals from the eyes to the brain. This can lead to vision problems, including blurred vision, and impaired color vision and depth perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic (keto) diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat regimen originally developed to manage seizure disorders, but that may also have anti-inflammatory effects. The diet forces the body to rely on fat rather than sugar for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest a keto diet may &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/02/benefits-ketogenic-diet-rrms-may-be-long-lasting-if-adherence/"&gt;help ease fatigue and improve exercise capacity&lt;/a&gt;, cognition, and hand dexterity in people with MS. However, research in mouse models of MS has yielded mixed results, possibly because some studies used medium-chain fatty acids and others used long-chain fatty acids, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These studies suggest the need for further analysis of the [keto diets] utilized in [MS] studies and exploration of how the chain length and saturation effects outcomes,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Keto diet’s effects on MS mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Iowa examined the effects of a keto diet made up of long-chain, saturated fatty acids on optic neuritis using mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an induced disease that’s often used to model MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-chain, saturated fatty acids are those typically found in red meats (beef, lamb, pork), dairy products (full-fat milk, cream, cheese, butter), and coconut and palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice were fed either the keto or standard diet starting before their disease induction, at the time of induction, or at symptom onset. Along with disease severity, optic neuritis was assessed by measuring visual acuity and electrical impulses along the optic nerve, and by imaging and tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that began the keto diet before EAE induction showed significantly worse disease severity than those on a standard diet. No significant differences were seen when the diet was introduced at disease induction or symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual acuity also declined more severely in mice pretreated with the keto diet, but again, no differences were seen in the groups that started the diet later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We propose that pretreatment with a long-chain, saturated [ketogenic diet] … leads to an initial priming of the immune system that results in a more robust immune response and inflammatory cascade when disease induction occurs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, some aspects of optic nerve health weren’t affected by diet. Imaging of the retina, a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, showed similar thinning of nerve layers across all EAE groups, regardless of diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the strength and speed of visual signals along the optic nerve were impaired in EAE mice compared with healthy mice, but these impairments didn’t differ between the diet groups. Tissue analyses also showed similar levels of optic nerve damage in EAE mice across all the diet groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate that irrespective of the timing of its implementation, a long-chain, saturated fatty acid [ketogenic diet] does not significantly improve visual outcomes in EAE mice,” wrote the researchers, who noted the findings underscore the importance of considering fat composition, and not just the amount of specific macronutrients, when evaluating the potential use of ketogenic diets in managing MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:19:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQT1E5bHVCQ1RPQlo1MWdFLW9QeHM2djRzX1lIZFp4bmgzUTdNSk1Db0lxd1RyX0x2MHcwb1Rhd29sR0F1YlZXcTRmZlJRNDMxZERsNUxldFZfRHBHcXUzcFVlSHEzZ2lhaUVqVFFRRGlDaEpmWE0ydFlkNGdSQlRiWmdXNFdTajZ5M1ZjNW1hMGwzR2NjQnFITGIzc08tLVRjaHlZa0F0THUxSjFad09uWWxRaDc0X1JUQm9NS3Zn</guid></item><item><title>想知道你能活多久吗？这个10秒钟的坐立测试可能有答案-印度时报 | Want to know how long you’ll live?

That’s not hype. According to a long-term study conducted in Brazil, your ability to perform this simple action without any assistance from your hands, knees, or support may hold clues about your longevity and risk of death from natural causes like heart disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test, often referred to as the “sit and rise” test, doesn’t rely on fancy gym equipment or medical diagnostics. It takes less than 10 seconds, requires no special gear, and yet it may reflect deep insights into your balance, strength, flexibility, and coordination. In fact, researchers found that adults who struggled with this basic movement were significantly more likely to die over the next decade compared to those who completed it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, come from a team of researchers at an exercise medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, led by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Claudio Gil Araujo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Over 12 years, the team observed over 4,200 adults, uncovering a striking link between this simple movement and long-term survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore what they found and why this test might be the wake-up call we didn’t know we needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your score on this 10-point test may predict your risk of early death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked 4,282 men and women between the ages of 46 and 75, evaluating their ability to sit down and stand up from the floor without using their hands, knees, or any support. Each participant received a score out of 10, broken into two components - five points for sitting, five for standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 12 years, researchers observed a stark correlation: the lower the score, the higher the risk of death. Participants who scored between 0 and 4 points were six times more likely to die during the follow-up period than those who earned a perfect 10. Those in the middle range (scoring 4.5 to 7.5) faced two to three times the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most eye-opening was this: half of the individuals who scored zero did not survive the 12 years, compared to just 4% of those who scored a full 10. That’s an 11-fold difference in mortality rates based on one deceptively simple movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A simple test that uncovers strength, balance, and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, sitting down and standing up seem trivial. But as Dr. Araujo explained to The Washington Post, the movement is surprisingly complex. It draws on several physical abilities at once, notably:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle strength, especially in the legs and core&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, which declines as we age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance, a major factor in fall prevention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordination and body composition, both tied to cardiovascular and metabolic health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test works because it captures all of these components in one fluid motion,” Araujo explained. “If someone struggles, it may reflect broader issues with inflammation, mobility, or muscle loss—factors known to contribute to chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s not just about the movement. It’s what that movement reveals about the body’s inner health, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One lost point = 31% higher risk of death, says study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that every point lost in the test correlated with a 31% increase in mortality risk, even when controlling for age, gender, and BMI. Those who required a hand, knee, or another part of the body for support had lower scores and also higher mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the deaths in this study weren’t all related to heart disease. Many were from natural causes, such as cancer and age-related decline. This suggests the test reflects overall vitality, not just cardiovascular strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study has gaps, yet the test still offers &lt;keyword id="27448230" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="real-health-clues" source="Orion"&gt;real health clues&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any study, this one comes with caveats. The participants were all drawn from a private exercise medicine clinic in Rio, meaning they may not represent broader populations, especially people with limited access to healthcare or varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, the study did not account for smoking status, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts agree the findings are worth paying attention to. “It’s not a diagnostic test,” Araujo clarified. “But it is a practical indicator. It gives people a chance to check in on their physical health without needing to visit a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Want to try the test yourself? Here’s how&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need special equipment to try the sit-and-rise test at home. But Dr. Araujo and his team strongly recommend having a partner nearby, especially for older adults or those with joint problems. Here’s the step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start in a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross one foot over the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without using your hands, knees, or arms for support, lower yourself to a seated position on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, stand back up again without using support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin with 10 points. Subtract 1 point for each time you use your hand, knee, forearm, or side of your leg to help. A loss of balance also subtracts 0.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: If you have knee or hip pain or a recent injury, skip this test. Talk to your physician instead.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why basic movement is a better &lt;keyword id="7809223" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-indicator" source="Orion"&gt;health indicator&lt;/keyword&gt; than you think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often focus on how fast we can run, how much we can lift, or how many steps we take in a day. But this research points to something more fundamental: our capacity for basic movement may tell us more about our ageing process than our mile time ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we grow older, preserving strength, balance, and coordination becomes more important than maximising peak performance. This test puts the spotlight on those quiet, everyday capacities we usually take for granted—until we lose them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your score is a signal, not a sentence: Here’s what to do next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating this as a pass-or-fail test of mortality, think of it as a red flag system. If you score low, it’s not a death sentence, it’s a sign that your body may benefit from more mobility work, strength training, and balance-focused activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercises like yoga, tai chi, resistance training, and even daily walking can help improve the very components this test measures. And unlike fad workouts or supplements, these approaches have well-established benefits for heart health, joint health, and inflammation levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxNckdnelE2dkxxZkZWYXE3R19yY1VabUdZTDRoU1BZbjdwc1lrQ0wzYlU3NXNGTWszWEplQjFiQjgxbld5cDZsVDRrdmphQ2pORHBIYVRKNElXeEdYbHhDLTRXdXp0dVdxYmxQREdUNzFiX3FyLVZHQmpEV1BNUTU3Z1l5eFgxM2U0OW96bUVDSVZxRVAzaDJDZC14UkZUUHJnUXBnaXVTZFAyT3NLRm54amVzSkFidlhvcEpPSDJjS3JuQXRvNkFpakIyc3VPMklqTEFtdi1KRTROMG84RzhzbEJEeThWQVY5aGpvVThYU0Y0UEd5bkFJRlJaaWJLTEpZS2R5UkJqd2hNc09qNjhtcUVn</guid></item><item><title>胃肠病学家推荐的支持肠道健康的首选补充剂- EatingWell | The #1 Supplement to Support Gut Health, Recommended by a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFB5MTI1NmRuUjNvZ1ZCbGdHbWx2d2JYRWk0SzdXQlZ5U2tGbDE4ZkkzajBCTkdzdFNhUUdJQXQ1MWNYUTFrSXNNcHZTQzIwblZFMDhSSEV4ajJDY3lHYkhJM21wZFU3RlhLYlowdTU5UHZBcGZiWm44dmlzcjh3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A balanced diet with probiotics, prebiotics, fermented food and a variety of plants is good for your gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need a supplement, consider psyllium husk, a gastroenterologist’s top supplement pick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psyllium husk supports digestion, lowers inflammation in your gut and increases the good bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to supporting your gut health, diet is key. “For some folks, it’s a drag, the fact that their parents were right, but I advise people to try to have a balanced diet,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/profile/stephen-bickston" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephen J. Bickston, M.D., AGAF, FACG, FASGE&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to a balanced diet, there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;specific gut-loving foods&lt;/a&gt; you can add, including probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods and a wide variety of plant-based foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if your diet is in check and you’re still struggling with gastrointestinal symptoms or just want to better support your gut, you may want to consider a supplement. Bickston’s go-to? That honor belongs to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; or desert Indian wheat, which comes from the &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plant. “Most people have never heard of it &lt;em&gt;[Plantago ovata],”&lt;/em&gt; says Bickston. “But just about everybody’s heard of Metamucil.” That’s right, psyllium husk is the basis of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-fiber-supplements-8420645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;popular fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, and it can do your gut some good.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bickston has dubbed psyllium husk “an equalizer for the bowels,” because consuming the fiber can help with both constipation and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Psyllium is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbs water, creating a gel-like substance.

This same gel-like substance is what lowers cholesterol levels and helps prevent colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, Bickston explains, “When the stool is too runny, fiber sponges up the excess fluid to give it more form. It helps people get to a happy medium.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium contains the prebiotic complex carbohydrate arabinoxylan, which serves as food for the good bacteria in your gut, leading to a proliferation of friendly intestinal microorganisms. This positive boost in gut bacteria can also offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11732962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relief for IBS-constipation symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s good for your gut is often good for your overall health, as is the case here. The good bacteria or probiotics that feed off the prebiotic, arabinoxylan, produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate, which supports your gut and immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Patients with IBS have higher levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker. Psyllium decreases &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894310/anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-beginners/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation in the gut&lt;/a&gt; and lowers CRP levels in these patients. At the same time, butyrate, which is produced by bacteria that feed on psyllium, supports the enteric nervous system, improving IBS symptoms. The fiber also improves the intestinal barrier function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Satiety and Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one doesn’t exactly better your gut health, but the magic of this benefit certainly happens in your GI tract. Psyllium prevents your stomach from emptying too quickly, which can play a role in managing your appetite. A meta-analysis of six studies found that consuming psyllium fiber before meals (about 10.8 grams per day) led to about a 5-pound &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289462/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; in less than five months in people with overweight or obesity. They also lost about an inch around their waistline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting, consuming psyllium husk causes side effects in some people, usually bloating or gas. Start slowly, with a small dose, and add as tolerated. And make sure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day to prevent new or worsening constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat your cereal: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s no surprise that Bickston wants you to eat a balanced breakfast. It’s the best way for your gut to start the day, because many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/153679/how-to-pick-the-healthiest-breakfast-cereal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packaged cereals&lt;/a&gt; already contain psyllium. Check the ingredients list on the label for psyllium or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7884127/how-flaxseed-can-help-digestion-make-you-regular/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;psyllium seed husk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also add psyllium to a hot cereal or overnight oats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a smoothie: &lt;/strong&gt;The best alternative to taking a capsule or gummy-style supplement is purchasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;psyllium powder&lt;/a&gt; and pouring it into a smoothie or anything else you can think of. “A teaspoon of the psyllium powder is 4 grams of fiber, and it can be added to whatever else someone likes to eat,” says Bickston. The fiber will help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291987/10-easy-ways-to-make-your-breakfast-smoothie-more-filling/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;add bulk or thicken the smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, similar to ground chia seeds or flaxseed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thicken soups: &lt;/strong&gt;Soups are typically thickened with cornstarch, a roux (flour and butter) or arrowroot. But you can give your soup a boost of fiber by thickening it with psyllium husk powder. Start with adding a tablespoon or less at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Psyllium has an earthy flavor, especially compared to milder options like cornstarch, so make sure to taste-test as you add it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re eating a well-balanced diet, with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy dose of probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, prebiotics, fermented foods and a wide variety of plant-based foods, you likely don’t need a supplement. But if you’re experiencing GI symptoms or are falling short on your fiber intake, you may want to consider a gastroenterologist’s top supplement pick—psyllium husk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk can help your gut health by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;normalizing digestion and bowel habits&lt;/a&gt;. It also feeds the good bacteria in your gut and lowers inflammation in the body. But be sure to talk with your health care provider before starting a new supplement, especially if you’re experiencing GI symptoms—this may be a sign of a more serious issue.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;If you often have nightmares, you may need to worry a bit more about your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research presented today at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 links frequent nightmares to faster biological aging and an over three times higher risk of premature death, even when taking into account other medical conditions. The researchers claim to be the first to demonstrate this association, which could have significant implications for how seriously one should consider persistent nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our sleeping brains cannot distinguish dreams from reality,” Abidemi Otaiku, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London and presumably an author of a forthcoming study, explained in an EAN &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ean-congress-frequent-nightmares-triple-risk-of-early-death-and-accelerate-ageing-major-study-finds-302484308.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s why nightmares often wake us up sweating, gasping for breath, and with our hearts pounding – because our fight-or-flight response has been triggered. This stress reaction can be even more intense than anything we experience while awake.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, researchers tracked the nightmare frequency of adults and children (whose nightmares were reported by their parents) for time periods of up to 19 years. Their results demonstrate that both children and adults who often have nightmares experience accelerated biological aging. Adults who suffered from weekly nightmares were also more than three times as likely to die before the age of 70 as those who rarely or never had nightmares, with the faster biological aging accounting for around 40% of that increased early mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Nightmares lead to prolonged elevations of cortisol, a stress hormone closely linked to faster cellular ageing,” Otaiku added. “For those who frequently experience nightmares, this cumulative stress may significantly impact the ageing process. Additionally, nightmares disrupt both sleep quality and duration, impairing the body’s essential overnight cellular restoration and repair. The combined effects of chronic stress and disrupted sleep likely contribute to the accelerated ageing of our cells and bodies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the link between chronic nightmares and faster aging was consistent in participants of all sexes, ages, mental health statuses, and ethnicities. Biological aging was measured by looking at people’s &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.630186/full"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the protective end caps of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are widely considered to be a sign of greater biological age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the research revealed weekly nightmares to more strongly predict early death than other widely known causes, including obesity, smoking, a bad diet, and low physical activity. Even less frequent nightmares, however, had their toll. Participants who reported having them monthly also experienced faster aging and increased premature mortality compared to those who reported rare or no nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As if living through terrifying experiences at night wasn’t bad enough, the associated health consequences highlighted in the new research carry important implications for how seriously we should take nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if we’re being honest, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-birds-are-so-stuffed-with-plastic-you-can-hear-them-crunch-2000607662"&gt;the state of plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/industrial-waste-is-turning-into-rock-in-just-decades-study-suggests-2000595525"&gt;human-driven accelerated geological processes&lt;/a&gt; are probably not helping in that category, either.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man was rushed into emergency surgery after his colon 'spontaneously' exploded out of his abdomen following a common surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 83-year-old suffered a 'spontaneous evisceration' of his small intestine - when parts of the intestines burst outside of body - following a hernia repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over three feet of his small intestine had burst through a two-inch hole in the skin due to the hernia, when parts of an organ bulge through a weak muscle or tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The protruding bowel had also become twisted, cutting off crucial blood supply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though evisceration of the bowel is rare, hernias strike 5million Americans a year. Over 1million hernia repairs are performed a year, making it one of the most common operations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent similar cases have included patients whose intestines &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14824901/Womans-colon-EXPLODES-body-coughing-hard-cold.html"&gt;burst through their body because they coughed too hard&lt;/a&gt; or suffered trauma like a stab wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Romanian man's doctors said he had no history of coughing fits or trauma, though he had multiple hernias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated no more than 100 cases of evisceration have been reported in medical literature, and cases like the unnamed man's have been seen just a handful of times, the doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man in Romania's small intestine spontaneously exploded out of his body after he suffered a hernia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the man wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/949330/s/B"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'Evisceration of intra-abdominal organs is a rare, serious event.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote the condition is most often caused by traumatic injuries like stab or gunshot wounds or from a sudden increase in abdominal pressure. This may be caused by coughing or heavy lifting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These factors may thin and weaken the abdominal lining, making it less protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed man was a rectal cancer survivor, and the hernia had formed near his stoma, a surgical opening that helps waste pass into a collection bag instead of through the anus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had already had one of these hernias, a parastomal hernia, repaired two years prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons fix a hernia by pushing the protruding tissue back in place and then closing up the weakened part of the abdominal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After seeing the extent of the man's evisceration, doctors transferred him to Military Clinical Emergency Hospital Sibiu in Romania from his local hospital in February 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he was admitted, it had been six hours since the intestine initially burst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the injury, he was conscious and alert the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a CT scan of the man's hernia taken one month before is spontaneously exploded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors removed the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, and connected it to the large intestine - the colon - to repair the damage. They also corrected the opening in the man's stoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man was discharged eight days after surgery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors treating the man said only a handful of cases have been reported of spontaneous evisceration from a parastomal hernia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of them involved patients with rectal cancer who had to receive a colostomy bag, and many suffered the injury due to intense coughing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4039678/"&gt;2012 case&lt;/a&gt;, a 62-year-old rectal cancer survivor from Turkey was admitted to the hospital after suffering abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting and swelling around the site of his colostomy operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vomiting and coughing caused the spontaneous evisceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2012 case was believed to be the first official report of parastomal evisceration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Experts hope tests will be used after diagnosis to classify patients as either “chemotherapy resistant” or “chemotherapy sensitive” to treatments, to avoid giving them therapies that will not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, which helped fund the research, said: “The days of chemotherapy being offered as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment are ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to this research, we are moving towards a future where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/31/nhs-patients-personalised-cancer-vaccines-world-first-trial/"&gt;personalised cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; is an option for many patients. Only by delivering more optimised, successful treatment will more people live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop the test and will be applying to regulators for its use in the clinic. They are also developing further tests for other targeted cancer drugs to find out how widely the technology could be used across different cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ania Piskorz, the head of genomics at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the co-lead author, said: “It was important to us to create a test that could be easily adopted in the clinic, using material we already collect during diagnosis and well-established genomic sequencing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is based on the full DNA sequence that we get from these methods, and we can adapt it to work alongside other genomic sequencing methods that are commonly used to personalise treatment for cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal Nature Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, it could be carried out in the presence of living cells without harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team made their discovery when they took polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – a type of plastic often found in food packaging and bottles – and, using sustainable chemical methods, converted it into a new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers incubated this material with a harmless strain of E coli they found it was converted into another substance known as Paba in a process that must have involved a Lossen rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Crucially, while the Lossen rearrangement typically involves harsh laboratory conditions, it occurred spontaneously in the presence of the E coli, with the researchers discovering it was catalysed by phosphate within the cells themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team add that Paba is an essential substance that bacteria need for growth, in particular the synthesis of DNA, and is usually made within the cell from other substances. However, the E coli used in the experiments was genetically modified to block these pathways, meaning the bacteria had to use the PET-based material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers say the results are exciting as they suggest plastic waste can be converted into biological material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is a way to just completely hoover up plastic waste,” said Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers then genetically modified the E coli further, inserting two genes – one from mushrooms and one from soil bacteria – that enabled the bacteria to convert PABA into paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team say that by using this form of E coli they were able to turn the PET-based starting material into paracetamol in under 24 hours, with low emissions and a yield of up to 92%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While further work would be needed to produce paracetamol in this way at commercial levels, the results could have a practical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It enables, for the first time, a pathway from plastic waste to paracetamol, which is not possible using biology alone, and it’s not possible using chemistry alone,” Wallace said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPX3YxaVVDcUp3cjlvSzVFYVExUENkZFJrYk1mWGI3X3FHZndKdm9QS0ZWMm1GRGl0S21tX3g4ejhYT0x6UjdDUnhQakphajZXTUJDMnhNd0NESTFfRTVkR0x1cjlkdjRIZTVQMWdHZmFrU3FIelN4YXVhSHFIU0tFN09wS0VqcUhldmhlc2kxSHZZclZrdzB4bVExVGdpYXVENEZINm5UQXpSRkRPLVd6NlVVdnRyWkF4ZTMzY0ZZY0lIX05ac1Uw</guid></item><item><title>专栏|我们问了一位肿瘤学家：我们是否应该担心内分泌干扰物？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | Column | We asked an oncologist: Should we worry about endocrine disruptors? - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQSmxRbWUyLVQxVmFBckZOc0NKbmhXZEtvbzc3dmo1SG41MGxYS3BQSUtfNndMeUFtYUpKd3pMbnUwN09wQTRJRHNteWNQdmhHaDNxXzlJNGJOZU1JNldIMkJjb0MzOVlLRGU0MTFqSkluc0Qwcl9sQ0xSZHpwT1BEV29DbjhoUHNPV1BXSE9tZ3otZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUUPKC3J2JBYBINCSDWANRBAHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’ve been on social media lately, chances are you’ve heard about endocrine disruptors.

Other studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027323002300082X" target="_blank"&gt;not found a consistent link&lt;/a&gt; between BPAs and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4AEM6ZJ4BGVZBV5PKY62KJQME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Despite the compelling laboratory data, there is insufficient research to definitively link BPAs with cancer in humans.

They’re also known as “forever chemicals,” because once PFAS are created, they persist in the environment because they do not break down like some other chemicals. PFAS can be found in everything from some types of dental floss to certain &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/08/10/forever-chemicals-pfas-period-underwear-tampons/" target="_blank"&gt;menstrual products&lt;/a&gt;.

Higher PFAS blood levels have been associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32944748/" target="_blank"&gt;kidney cancer&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37741007/" target="_blank"&gt;Black populations&lt;/a&gt;. Higher levels were also seen in women with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36843273/" target="_blank"&gt;postmenopausal breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and in men with testicular cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZU4SF7ODPJGBRF6P5YH6DAYYME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2024, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-industry-actions-end-sales-pfas-used-us-food-packaging?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that companies were phasing out the use of PFAS in food packaging. And last year, the Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/04/10/pfas-drinking-water-epa-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;set limits&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of PFAS in drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPD4H7BOCJBAFONKKVYSF2FK3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But because PFAS are so ubiquitous, they can be hard to avoid. It’s a good idea for your overall health to consume fresh food that is not heavily packaged or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/07/healthier-ultra-processed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt;. This will reduce your PFAS exposure. Several brands of cookware are also now &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/16/nonstick-pans-pfas-teflon-flu/" target="_blank"&gt;PFAS-free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XXUR2G5FXVC2LIWW7KCD2L7RRQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XXUR2G5FXVC2LIWW7KCD2L7RRQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Phthalates&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2G6H2NXCFRDJJKBIJKBUK7HCHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20used%20in%20a,to%20make%20plastics%20more%20durable." target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products that make plastics more durable. These liquids, which are colorless, odorless and oily, resist evaporation and function as solvents and stabilizers in products such as perfumes, shampoos, hair sprays, nail polishes and cleansers. The most common one in cosmetics is diethyl phthalate (DEP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L3PPELHBJRDIHBGAPRQOTP3GLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Products like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/10/18/chemical-hair-straightening-uterine-cancer-black-women-nih/" target="_blank"&gt;chemical hair straighteners&lt;/a&gt; and dyes, which have been associated with certain &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/02/phthalates-perfume-safe-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;hormone-sensitive cancers&lt;/a&gt;, including cancers of the breast and ovaries, may contain phthalates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NU7WORHYMFDQVBTBBHLCMNJM5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797377/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of sisters in 2020 that included more than 46,000 women found that permanent hair dye use was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly among Black women, while frequent use of straighteners was linked to a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. A more recent study in the same cohort found that any use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36245087/" target="_blank"&gt;straightening products&lt;/a&gt; within the previous year was linked to an increased the risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KFRKQ66QHFE3TG27ASBC3MKR6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keep in mind that the overall excess cancer risk is still really low. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, approximately one in eight women, or 13 percent, will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. Permanent dye use may increase that risk by 9 percent, from 13 percent to 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NA5DFIMWBNGVZL2AD5ACUEOE4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Further research is needed to determine whether phthalates are the concern in these products, or if another chemical or factor may be a culprit. In the meantime, I recommend checking to see if your beauty products such as shampoo or chemical hair products contain phthalates, or looking for phthalate-free products. Another option is to choose &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/02/phthalates-perfume-safe-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;fragrance-free products&lt;/a&gt; and avoid perfumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TH5VSQWRI5HJTHEREA4ABXAUHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are everywhere, and we may learn more in coming years to implicate them more directly as a cancer risk factor. In the meantime, here’s my advice: Focus on taking steps for reducing cancer risk that are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/27/decrease-risk-cancer-science/" target="_blank"&gt;backed by stronger evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t smoke, reduce your alcohol intake, exercise regularly and eat whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I6XV7EYPJBH7XNB7LVHEUAHVTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mikkael A.

Stop,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have the lungs of a 70-year-old man. All the small airway tubes at the bottom of your lungs, those are scarred up, permanently, forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jacob Temple, from Kentucky , first started vaping when he was just 12-years-old, under the impression that it was 'safer' than traditional smoking. But at just 24-years-old, the painter suffered a near-fatal mini heart attack and medics discovered his addiction had left him with lifelong scarring in his lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can never inflate or deflate my lungs to one hundred percent, ever again in my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It feels like I'm breathing through a straw constantly. Always. Just never getting enough air and there's nothing that can be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The scar tissue is permanent. Please stop.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to tackle the surge in youth vaping, from June 1, it was made illegal for &lt;span&gt;businesses to sell or supply single-use vapes, such as Elf bars and Lost Mary, in shops and online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only devices considered reusable—with a rechargeable battery and replaceable coil—are now allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So popular was the move in Westminster that although the Tories drew up the legislation, Labour took it over and pushed it through after winning last year's General Election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike smoking, vaping involves inhaling nicotine in a vapour rather than smoke, supposedly removing the two most harmful elements of smoking, burning tobacco and producing carbon monoxide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, health chiefs, have suggested that vaping is less harmful than smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unlike smoking, vaping involves inhaling nicotine in a vapour rather than smoke, supposedly removing the two most harmful elements of smoking, burning tobacco and producing carbon monoxide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roughly one in ten adults are estimated to be hooked on vaping, as smoking rates fall &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However. the long-term effects of e-cigarettes still remain a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have expressed fear there could be a wave of lung disease, dental issues and even &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8ef7edb0-2812-11ef-8888-cd6a079abb92" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the coming decades in people who took up the habit at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Lung Association, inflammation from vaping can occur after just a month of vaping, as nanoparticles from the vapour progressively become embedded in lung tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ceclie Rose, a US-based lung specialist, said: 'Chronic vaping of these chemicals could lead to substantial adverse lung health outcomes in the longer term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We’re very well-conditioned to taking a careful history for those patients who smoke, but we need the same to be true for vaping now too.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Steroids and inhalers can help manage symptoms like shortness of breath, but in most cases, a sufferer's lungs will never function at full capacity again.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms include a cough, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Temple initially dismissed his persistent cough, but became increasingly worried when he started to experience severe abdominal pain.     &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A shocking MailOnline investigation last year even uncovered vapes resembling sweets and high street stores selling the devices next to chocolate and fruit gummies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had serious pains where my kidney and liver are.

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a few times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two pints of high-strength beer or cider; three pints of low-strength beer or cider; two large glasses of wine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six units of alcohol – under one unit per day – is the most that you can drink in a week, as a man, without significantly increasing your risk of liver cancer. Doing so will still increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer, however, by 13 per cent, according to Dr Rumgay’s estimates. If you smoke and drink at the same time, “there is lots of evidence to say that you are making both activities more dangerous in terms of your cancer risk,” Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to fewer than one unit per day on average is much safer when it comes to cancer risk than exceeding this limit, however, “as your risk of developing any cancer increases with each unit you drink per day,” says Dr Croker. That means having no more than two pints of high-strength beer or cider or three pints of low-strength beer or cider in a week. Again, Dr Rumgay recommends keeping a close eye on your units wherever possible, and choosing lower-strength drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of drinking regularly but having fewer than one unit a day on average “are less well understood”, says Dr Croker. We do know, however, that while drinking this much will not significantly increase your risk of colorectal or liver cancer, having one three-unit pint every week, on average, will increase your risk of mouth cancer by 5 per cent, says Dr Rumgay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 57 per cent of British men drink alcohol at least once a week, according to an NHS survey. “Reducing your alcohol consumption by swapping out your pint for a non-alcoholic drink would be a very good move for your health, if it means that it allows you to keep socialising and enjoying yourself without consuming more alcohol,” Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a few times a year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having one three-unit pint every few weeks, on average, would increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer by 4 per cent, according to Dr Rumgay. Having a pint every few months, meanwhile, would increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer by just 0.4 per cent. Neither drinking pattern would cause a significant increase in your risk of colorectal or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no amount of drinking is completely safe, you may be pleased to know that celebrating with a pint or few a couple of weekends a year will up your cancer risk only marginally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What these statistics mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following risk estimates have been provided by Dr Rumgay. They are based on the lifetime risk of different cancers among men who don’t drink at all. For colorectal cancer in men, this is 6.5 per cent, while the lifetime risk of mouth or throat cancer is 0.8 per cent, and the lifetime risk of liver cancer is also 0.8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combines with the additional risk posed by how many grams of alcohol you drink per day on average to give your “absolute risk”, not taking into account your health in general. Where we talk about a number of men out of 100 who will develop one of these cancers in their lifetime, we have rounded it to the nearest whole number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors that increase a man’s risk of cancer, such as smoking, being overweight, or having a family history of the disease. All these factors mean that you may be at an increased or decreased risk from drinking compared with other men who consume a similar amount of alcohol to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures compare the “relative risk” of different groups of men and don’t reflect your personal risk as a whole. For this reason, “if you’re young, maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly, then the risk posed to you by drinking alcohol is lower, but any amount is still dangerous,” Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to say no to another drink – by Prof Richard Cooke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men find it much harder than women to say no to “another one”. The WCRF’s recent survey found that a quarter of men worry about being judged or being seen as boring when they say no to alcohol, and one in five of us has called in sick the day after a weekday night out as we can’t make it into work (compared with just one in 10 women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that men rely on excuses more than women – half of men have made an excuse not to drink, compared with 40 per cent of women. My work as a health psychologist shows that coming up with a reason that’s personal to you when you’re turning down a drink is the best way to stick to your guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Work out why you’re doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide why it is that you want to drink a bit less – whether it’s to reduce your cancer risk or feel clearer-headed on Sunday morning. (Tip: avoid saying something such as you want to save money or that you’re trying to lose weight, because research suggests that these reasons are quite easy to counteract, by other people buying you a drink, or saying something such as, “The diet can wait!”) Instead, choose something that’s specific to you, something that you care about, as your reason to reduce your drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Explain it to people confidently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that when you explain clearly and confidently why you don’t want another pint, people are more likely to accept your explanation and less likely to push you to drink. Just over 10 per cent of men choose to say that they are trying to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/ten-exercise-steps-to-get-fit-from-scratch/"&gt;get fitter&lt;/a&gt; or need to avoid a hangover to make it to the gym the next day, and for them, this seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Try different moderation techniques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to drink less without suffering the feeling of missing out. One is to try low-and-no drinks that look very similar to alcoholic drinks, which can be especially helpful if you struggle with peer pressure (though the jury is out on whether these may increase drinking in the long term). Another is bookending: starting and ending the night with soft drinks and having alcoholic drinks in the middle. Giving a few a go and seeing what works for you can be a big help.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re wiser, more confident and unapologetically yourself. But let’s be honest. Our bodies and minds don’t exactly operate like they did in our 20s. From &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917238/heres-what-happens-to-your-hormones-as-you-age/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fluctuating hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fluctuating hormones&lt;/a&gt; to the occasional creaking bones and aching joints, it’s clear that self-care needs to take center stage. And what better time to give yourself some TLC than right before bed? After all, your &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-for-healthy-aging-11712308" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:evening routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;evening routine&lt;/a&gt; can set the tone for &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, mental clarity and a healthier tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get you started, we reached out to registered dietitians for simple yet effective ways women over 50 can optimize their nights. These aren’t complicated rituals or time-consuming chores. They are just six practical, doable habits to help you wind down your day while doing something good for your body and mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Sip an Alcohol-Free Mocktail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alcohol-containing drink;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;alcohol-containing drink&lt;/a&gt; in the evening, consider swapping it for a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7967514/healthy-summer-mocktails-for-mocktail-summer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:booze-free mocktail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;booze-free mocktail&lt;/a&gt; or a glass of alcohol-free wine or beer. “Most women over age 50 complain of insomnia and sleep disturbances due to perimenopause and menopause,” says &lt;a href="https://thehormonedietitian.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Azzaro, RDN, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Azzaro, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “Symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats can keep women up, and other hormone imbalances can make it difficult to get a full night of quality sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why she recommends that women over 50 cut out alcohol before bed. “While you may feel that it helps you fall asleep faster, it results in more interrupted, less restful sleep,” she says. Research agrees, linking higher alcohol consumption to shorter, less &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:restorative sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;restorative sleep&lt;/a&gt; and even snoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Eat a Protein-Rich Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 50, women lose muscle mass more rapidly due to hormonal shifts, specifically [due to] a decline in estrogen levels during menopause, which affects bone density and muscle strength,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Protein before bed—such as Greek yogurt, cottage cheese or a plant-based protein smoothie—[has been shown to] support overnight muscle repair and synthesis, especially when paired with resistance exercise.” For example, one study found that men who ate protein after working out in the evening had higher rates of muscle building and repair than those who performed evening exercise without consuming protein. While we can’t say for sure that the same would be true for women, a healthy, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8062726/dietitian-favorite-high-protein-snack-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein-rich bedtime snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein-rich bedtime snack&lt;/a&gt; is worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Brush Your Teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve had your snack, it’s time to brush those teeth—even if you’re tired and can’t motivate! Brushing before bed is important for everyone. But it becomes even more critical as you enter your 50s as oral health becomes increasingly tied to your overall health as you age. Problems like dry mouth, tooth loss, cavities, gum disease and oral cancer are more common in older people and can affect more than just their teeth. They can also lead to issues like poor nutrition and lower quality of life and can even worsen conditions like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease or diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart disease or diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, when your teeth are in good shape, it’s easier—and more enjoyable—to eat &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy foods like fruits and veggies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;healthy foods like fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Put a Glass of Water by Your Bedside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple act of having a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-tonight-if-you-didnt-drink-enough-water-11755822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glass of water by your bedside;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;glass of water by your bedside&lt;/a&gt; could be one of the most underrated habits for women who are over age 50. “Even if you don’t wake up in the night, night sweats can dehydrate you during sleep, so you are most likely waking up somewhat dehydrated,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.franceslargemanroth.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Having the water right there next to you helps you get a jump on hydration for the day, which helps you feel your best.” And if hot flashes are an issue, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7870247/what-happens-when-you-drink-more-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sipping cold water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;sipping cold water&lt;/a&gt; before you hit the hay might help cool things off, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Take Magnesium Glycinate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle relaxation, maintaining a healthy nervous system and regulating sleep. Yet, as we age, we may not absorb this mineral as efficiently as we did when we were younger. And many of us don’t consume enough magnesium to meet our needs. Enter magnesium glycinate. This highly absorbable form of magnesium is readily taken up by the body for more restful sleep and overall relaxation at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond sleep, this supplement may aid in maintaining strong bones, as magnesium is essential for &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-take-calcium-supplements-for-maximum-absorption-11750003" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calcium absorption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt; and bone mineralization. Prioritizing bone health becomes increasingly important after age 50 to reduce the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of osteoporosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; and maintain overall mobility. Research shows that higher magnesium intake is linked to better bone density in the hip and femoral neck, which are key areas for mobility and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Practice Diaphragmatic Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diaphragmatic breathing, or deep belly breathing, is a simple way to calm your body and mind. “This slow, intentional breathing—inhale through the nose with a deep belly expansion followed by a slow exhale— can calm the nervous system and may promote better sleep,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatsimplynutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brittany Scanniello, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brittany Scanniello, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also support your long-term heart health. How so? Stress is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, which is a leading cause of death for older women. Promising research has shown that diaphragmatic breathing can &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903638/science-backed-ways-to-be-happier-amp-reduce-stress-that-are-easy-and-free/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce stress levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce stress levels&lt;/a&gt; by improving blood pressure and respiratory rate and lowering the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress hormone cortisol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;stress hormone cortisol&lt;/a&gt;. While more research is needed, taking a few deep belly breaths before turning in could be an easy, low-cost way to ease your stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your nighttime habits can be an impactful way to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-every-morning-11695945" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prioritize self-care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;prioritize self-care&lt;/a&gt; and support your body through the changes that happen after age 50. Whether you recently turned 50 or have already passed this milestone, dietitians recommend making the most of your evenings by &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol-8773934" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:swapping out alcohol for mocktails;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;swapping out alcohol for mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, eating a protein-rich bedtime snack and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-help-this-dietitian-stay-hydrated-11753491" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:staying hydrated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;staying hydrated&lt;/a&gt;. They also recommend taking a magnesium glycinate supplement and doing some deep-breathing exercises to help you wind down and prepare for restorative sleep. And don’t forget to brush those teeth! As you age, your dental health impacts multiple aspects of your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, small changes can lead to big results over time. By choosing to nurture your body and mind in these practical ways, you’re setting the foundation for healthier days and more peaceful nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-do-before-bed-11757559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBJSmZzQ2txcUxHS0tWekNxcVJ0RVA1SmdFSWt3a2N1MFNqN2ctS2pIWmpTbUNGTXJraVJJM2k5eDA5N3JNbm55TGxvY09XM3lJUjl1TTVnbVVCTS1sV1R5ZGg1S0FQYU5W</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，猫寄生虫会严重破坏大脑功能- ScienceAlert | Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPc1EwZUFqNTdkUGxjdUdKVlowa2tZZ2c4bDA1YnEyR3dQaW03SU1HN2h1YTk1X2NWTHhhdXpBV2YyVmdFMXgyaEszN1RoXzllbWlZSDc0V1Q1Qm9PemZQd3dVQzNtX0hJSDRqTExTQ2ZuS0t1X05pdUhLcThSZkhJdWZ1czZtNGk1eGZ3bVJzbEwzeFJlRldEYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Infection with a common parasite can seriously disrupt the brain function of intermediate hosts – potentially including humans – new research has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when the number of neurons affected is relatively small, toxoplasmosis – infection with the parasite &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – strongly interferes with neuronal communication. That's &lt;span&gt;revealed by a study involving mouse brain cells, some grown in a dish and some collected from living animals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons infected with the parasite release fewer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;extracellular vesicles&lt;/a&gt; (EVs), tiny lipid-bound packets of proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites that are used as a means of intercellular communication. It's a finding that carries a lot of weight in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-little-evidence-that-the-infamous-cat-parasite-causes-psychological-changes-in-humans-study-finds"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; on the behavioral impact of toxoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-may-be-hijacking-evolution-on-planet-earth?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parasites May Be Hijacking Evolution on Planet Earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;says parasite immunologist Emma Wilson&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California Riverside School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain's neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a parasite known for wreaking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-figured-out-how-a-parasite-transmitted-by-cats-may-alter-our-behaviour"&gt;behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; – for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-strange-happens-to-wolves-infected-by-an-infamous-mind-altering-parasite"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-parasite-has-been-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-rage-disorder"&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; – in its hosts. It likes to find a cell and nestle inside, and the types of cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasite-infecting-one-in-three-people-really-likes-the-retina-scientists-say"&gt;it likes most&lt;/a&gt; are neurons, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-invading-parasite-could-be-hacked-to-deliver-meds-in-your-head"&gt;crossing the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; to get there. Once inside, the protozoan can hunker down for decades, just hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's one of the most successful parasites on the planet, and there are few warm-blooded species it can't invade. However, it can only reproduce in cats; research suggests that some of the behavioral changes exhibited by infected organisms are to force them into an increased likelihood of encountering cats, such as rodents suddenly wanting to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608310104"&gt;seek out the smell of cat pee&lt;/a&gt; instead of avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have found that the evidence for such behavioral manipulation is circumstantial, and that we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2013.01.004"&gt;can't conclusively link&lt;/a&gt; these changes to the parasite. It's especially complicated for humans; behavior is complex, and it's difficult to attribute changes to any one cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165305" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-165305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts-600x371.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165305" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Toxoplasmosis is particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.

The researchers infected mouse neurons with &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;, and carefully analyzed the production and content of EVs, comparing it against EV production in healthy, uninfected neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that not only was EV production reduced, the content of the packets was altered compared to those produced by healthy neurons. Since the role of EVs is to relay information between neurons and astrocytes, this had a knock-on effect: the astrocyte gene expression was also altered, resulting in increased production of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5043087"&gt;specific immune signatures&lt;/a&gt;, and a decrease in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.03.002"&gt;transporter&lt;/a&gt; that helps remove excess glutamate from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess glutamate is linked to problems such as seizures and neural damage, complications that are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9756-toxoplasmosis"&gt;known to arise&lt;/a&gt; from severe cases of toxoplasmosis. This suggests that we might be underestimating the impact of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;Wilson says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shockingly large number of humans harbor &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;. It's mostly contracted from ingesting poorly prepared food, such as undercooked meat, or from interacting with cat feces. &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/344706-overview"&gt;Prevalence rates&lt;/a&gt; reach &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/CMR.05013-11"&gt;as high as 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; in some parts of the world; in the US, an estimated 10 to 30 percent of the population is infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will never know about their little neural hitchhikers and will sail through life unaffected, but for some people – particularly infant, elderly, immunocompromised, and pregnant people – infection &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20356249"&gt;can become dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective prevention tools are to cook your meat thoroughly, wash your vegetables, and wash your hands carefully after handling kitty litter. Meanwhile, research such as Wilson's may help us better understand the parasites, and work on ways of protecting ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;she says&lt;/a&gt;. "If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The benefits of creatine include improved strength and power, enhanced recovery, support for lean muscle growth, and better performance in high-intensity training.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Tushar Tayal busted several myths associated with creatine supplements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: Creatine leads to weight gain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: While it’s true that creatine can cause a slight increase in body weight, this is primarily due to water retention within the muscle cells rather than fat gain. When creatine is taken, it pulls water into the muscles, making them appear fuller and more hydrated. This may result in a weight increase of around 1–2 kg during the first week, which is completely normal and not indicative of fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: Creatine causes bloating or damages the kidneys.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: When taken in recommended doses by healthy individuals, creatine is safe for long-term use. Bloating is uncommon and usually associated with excessive intake or insufficient hydration. As for kidney health, multiple long-term studies have shown no negative impact in people with normal kidney function. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidneyfriendly-diet-to-lower-your-creatinine-levels-promote-overall-kidney-health-101697185519262.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney-friendly diet to lower your creatinine levels, promote overall kidney health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney-friendly diet to lower your creatinine levels, promote overall kidney health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/23/original/containers-dumbbells-arrangement_1750673586624.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Creatine does not cause bloating." title="Creatine does not cause bloating."&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Creatine does not cause bloating.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: Creatine is a steroid or illegal performance enhancer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in foods like red meat and fish and is also produced by the body. Creatine supplements simply help saturate the muscles with more of what the body already uses for quick energy during high-intensity activities. It is completely legal and widely studied, with consistent evidence supporting its effectiveness and safety for both athletic and general health use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: You have to cycle on and off creatine to avoid side effects.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no scientific evidence suggesting that cycling creatine (i.e., taking breaks after a period of use) is necessary for safety or effectiveness. Creatine does not suppress natural production in the way anabolic steroids do, and long-term daily use (at recommended doses) has been shown to be safe for healthy individuals. That said, some people choose to cycle for personal preference or budget reasons, but it's not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tips to use creatine supplement in daily routine:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be consistent&lt;/strong&gt;: To incorporate creatine into a daily routine, consistency is key. Many people begin with a loading phase of 20 grams per day (split into 4 doses) for about 5 to 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 to 5 grams daily. Others skip the loading phase and stick to 3 to 5 grams a day from the start, which also works well though results may appear more gradually.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-workout consumption&lt;/strong&gt;: Creatine can be taken at any time of the day but consuming it post-workout with carbohydrates and protein may improve its absorption. It’s best to choose creatine monohydrate, which is the most researched and effective form available. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-6-essential-supplements-and-why-they-are-important-in-your-30s-collagen-to-magnesium-101747287122879.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Doctor shares 6 essential supplements and why they are important in your 30s: Collagen to magnesium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor shares 6 essential supplements and why they are important in your 30s: Collagen to magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Staying well-hydrated is important while using creatine, as it increases water retention in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

From sugar-packed protein bars to popcorn fortified with the important macronutrient, you might be surprised to learn that most &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" target="_blank"&gt;Americans actually get plenty of protein&lt;/a&gt; in their diets or even eat excess amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89854c" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, high-protein diets are all over TikTok and other social media platforms, with supporters claiming they can help with energy, muscle-building and more. While protein can help you feel full and is crucial for many roles in the body, there are some risks associated with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-much-protein-is-too-much-rcna156560" target="_blank"&gt;eating too much protein&lt;/a&gt;, such as kidney problems, dehydration and digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2923e1" class="body-graf"&gt;And focusing on protein may lead you to deprioritize other equally important nutrients, which can be a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6a2af4" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Include Fiber in High-Protein Diets &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b42a33" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of times when people are on a high-protein diet, they’re eliminating other sources of food,” Christina Fasulo, a dietitian at UCLA Health, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/high-protein-diet-fiber-increase-why-rcna209765" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. “Most people need to have a set amount of fiber in their diet, and a lot of that is getting displaced by a high protein diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edc252" class="body-graf"&gt;Americans should be consuming 25-38 grams of fiber per day, but  5% of men and 9% of women consume the recommended amount of fiber daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e422dc" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a43ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating enough fiber — both soluble and insoluble — improves health in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670350" class="body-graf"&gt;Soluble fiber, the type found in seeds, beans and lentils, “is kind of like a sponge, where it’s slowing things down that are passing through our digestive tract,” Fasulo said. Whereas, insoluble fiber, present in vegetables and whole grains, pushes food through the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-deccee" class="body-graf"&gt;Adequate fiber intake promotes healthy bowel habits, controls blood sugar, supports a healthy gut microbiome, lowers rates of colon cancer and possibly contributes to reducing chronic disease, such as diabetes. It also prevents constipation, which can feel uncomfortable, and can be common a meat-heavy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-331220" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e8f55" class="body-graf"&gt;You can gradually incorporate more fiber into your meals to build up your intake without causing digestion issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-965de9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Olufemi Kassim, a gastroenterologist at Northwestern Medicine, suggests starting by adding one high-fiber food to each meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-12cf90" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you can hit 20 to 30 grams of fiber from food, that’s ideal,” Kassim told NBC News. “You’re not just getting the benefit from fiber from eating an apple a day, but you’re also getting all the great micronutrients like vitamins.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c243a" class="body-graf"&gt;Some accessible and nutritious &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-fiber-foods-rcna168629?search=20%20high%20fiber%20foods" target="_blank"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt; to start adding to your diet include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d29c03" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

From climbing stairs to walking long distances, aching knees can make even the simplest tasks difficult. But the good news is that most knee problems can be prevented or managed with the right care.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Shriram Nene, who is also the husband of Bollywood diva Madhuri Dixit took to social media to share simple, practical tips to support knee health. In his Instagram post, he explained six easy strategies to strengthen the knees, reduce pain, and prevent long-term joint damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Strong knees, strong life! Don’t wait until it’s too late—start caring today for a pain-free tomorrow,” he wrote in his caption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the six expert-backed tips for healthy knees:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Move, but move smart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Staying active is essential for knee health but it’s about choosing the right kind of movement. Dr. Nene recommends low-impact exercises such as cycling, swimming, and walking, which are gentle on the joints while still building strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Skip high-impact workouts like jump squats and intense runs,” he advised.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Vinay Kumaraswamy, Consultant – Orthopaedics at Fortis Hospital, Rajaji Nagar, told The Indian Express that cycling is a great way to protect your knees.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Cycling is low-impact, which reduces wear and tear on joints. It also increases synovial fluid production, a natural lubricant essential for smooth joint movement,” Dr. Kumaraswamy explained.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Watch your weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Extra weight can put added pressure on the knees leading to faster wear and pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramneek Mahajan, Director – Orthopaedics and Joint Replacement, Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Delhi told The Indian Express, “Even one extra kilogram of body weight can put up to four kilograms of pressure on your knees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggests making small changes, like walking inside your home every hour and avoiding sitting for long periods. If knees are swollen, use ice or heat packs for relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhdK4zRpyT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Strengthen the muscles that support your knees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Your knees don’t work alone, they rely on muscles like the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves for support. Dr. Nene recommends including squats, leg lifts, and hamstring curls in your routine two to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Good posture and strong support muscles reduce pressure on the joints. Bad posture can worsen knee pain over time,” warned Dr. Mahajan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He also advises incorporating weight-loss exercises into your routine to further reduce knee stress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Wear the right shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shoes play a bigger role in joint health than many people realize. Dr. Nene emphasizes choosing cushioned footwear with arch support and avoiding high heels, thin flats, or worn-out shoes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Poor footwear can change your posture and walking style, leading to misalignment and long-term knee damage. Make sure your shoes match your activity level and foot structure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Know the RICE method for injury relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In case of a knee injury or sudden pain, Dr. Nene recommends following the RICE method:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;R – Rest&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I – Ice&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;C – Compression&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;E – Elevation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple four-step approach helps reduce swelling, improve circulation, and speed up healing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Stretch every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tight muscles can pull on your joints and create discomfort. Dr. Nene suggests doing just 5 minutes of stretching daily to reduce stiffness and prevent knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Try easy stretches like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing quad stretch&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Calf stretch&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hamstring stretch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can improve flexibility and ease pressure on the knees over time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The knees are one of the most important joints in the body, bearing the weight of everything we do—from walking to running to standing. But most of us don’t start thinking about them until they start hurting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nene’s message is clear: Don’t wait for knee pain to take over your life. Small steps like stretching, wearing the right shoes, and maintaining a healthy weight can go a long way in protecting your joints and keeping you moving comfortably for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>financialexpress.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 11:48:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxOakFZQjRsTjV2RkpFZTQ4LUFpT3ppWTJQSk5HQU5XRWp6QTk0SWlKWnlSZEJvV2ZGSVlicldOY2kwTzluMEM1eWp1dkk2R0hIMkNnX2pwZEgxanVibFZjOFVPZFpiUFNVdlpZcEpKbGVsLXBPSExwWUxON0VpVmdVbFM3QkNOWndXUzVUVWNRai0wZ2VXN29ZNkJGSnlnY19Ha3RtRlNyMGhvSG90NEdfV0k2ZjhMVTlDazQ0bHI3TS1ySXMxeHc3ODF4WHQ3NlBiZWJiU2Z3Zw</guid></item><item><title>使用大麻治疗健康问题的真相-《华盛顿邮报》 | The truth about using cannabis for health problems - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPZDFkYzZOZ1hLYU1DcElWMDBuRU40RmRPNjNHVk8zOVhXaTd4OFNKUzNab1ZaSnR3UkxDM214OWpGdnVWQk51S0paQWQxSndIWnhEU2JMTjdBR29scmpiTEprRnpsZENZSGhEM1NXdWttQ1ZZaXYydVdzTjBTd0ZfeVZsOWd6c0pZSHpYbVZzRXdFb1Q4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PERUWHRIBNANRBX623DJ4NWT4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MTEALUXY5NCPDMXNEZK5JVOD4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many U.S. states have legalized cannabis, and there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults using it, says Jeffrey Quinlan, a family physician and professor of family medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O5BZIFEY2RCERJ6LRH4GQ6P4PA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In fact, 21 percent of people ages 50 and up have smoked, vaped or consumed cannabis (in what’s usually called an edible) in the past year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/how-older-adults-use-think-about-and-discuss-cannabis" target="_blank"&gt;recent poll from the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. And 12 percent do so at least once a month. The reasons? To relax, improve sleep, feel good, relieve pain and improve mental health or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QI7DEVFMGFFS3J4QDL5245RCYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But is this safe? “There’s not a lot of research,” Quinlan says. That said, we have at least some evidence that cannabis may help some people, but there are risks — for older adults in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XKQOCRSJRJBHDEKZB7ZH7XZDSI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XKQOCRSJRJBHDEKZB7ZH7XZDSI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How cannabis might help&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XEOEAUO2NVCSBJHWHTZPBFGLLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some patients tell Quinlan they use cannabis to help with pain, anxiety and sleep — similar to the medical reasons mentioned in the Michigan poll. Of these, the evidence is strongest for treating chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H3PKPB3QJBG4HPEBNAK366BVXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s also substantial evidence that it may ease nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and may help control muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, according to a &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24625/the-health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids-the-current-state" target="_blank"&gt;2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. And some evidence suggests that cannabis may provide some short-term help for people who have &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/guide-to-getting-better-sleep-a8432032642/" target="_blank"&gt;trouble sleeping&lt;/a&gt; due to obstructive sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, chronic pain and MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J2MJKXAT6FHO5FVOGEFNL2ITCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But we still have much to learn about the right dosages, which vary from person to person and can change over time, as well as the efficacy of cannabis compared with other treatments, says Erin Bonar, a professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. She’s one of the researchers associated with the poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q7IHTT6KSFDQXB3EZIA2NMSSHE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q7IHTT6KSFDQXB3EZIA2NMSSHE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Risks of cannabis use&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JCUKPI5S5VHW7LGTRRPM3UBMHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some doctors say that cannabis is a safer way to manage chronic pain than powerful, potentially addictive opioid drugs. But about 21 percent of regular users develop cannabis use disorder. This can increase the likelihood of risky behaviors like driving while high, and it can affect relationships and increase tolerance for cannabis, which causes some people to use it more and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EU75HVMFYBGNBCMGBI7KNCB2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And higher doses can elevate heart rate and increase blood pressure, Quinlan says, which may raise heart attack and stroke risks, especially in people who already have heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VISJCZ256RDBFOF22KXUHEHI2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who use cannabis for mental health problems like anxiety also need to be wary, Bonar says. In some cases, it might improve the condition short-term, she says. But some people then feel worse when not using it, which can escalate anxiety over time. And recent research suggests that it’s associated with a greater likelihood of mental health and substance abuse problems, as well as accidents and injuries. High dosages can also cause paranoia and in rare cases can increase the risk of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XJSQJ5XTPNHATLU5A2LEHY4PAU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XJSQJ5XTPNHATLU5A2LEHY4PAU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Before using cannabis&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PYNYKOFD4BC5FIZOXKCN5CH3WQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell your doctor.&lt;/b&gt; According to the Michigan poll, 44 percent of monthly cannabis users said they had not discussed it with their health care providers. Your doc can tell you if medications you may be taking — such as blood thinners, statins, antihistamines, antidepressants and medications with sedative effects — interact with cannabis. Your doctor may also be able to give you guidance on how to access medical cannabis — though it won’t be covered by Medicare or other insurance because it’s still illegal on the federal level — and help you monitor your use to see whether it’s helping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MJEMRPYVR5DULPTBTAY5OTKJCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid smoking and vaping.&lt;/b&gt; Using cannabis in these forms may cause health problems just like smoking or vaping tobacco, Quinlan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GQWXZTP2Q5FSZGUATZTESG4ON4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary of THC content labels.&lt;/b&gt; Most research indicates they’re not reliable. So if you’re going to use cannabis, opt for the lowest possible dosage (which may be an edible with 5 milligrams of THC or less), especially if you haven’t used the substance before, Quinlan says. Plus, it’s now easy to find cannabis products with a strength of 20 to 30 percent.

There is research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASCO-Alcohol-Cancer-Nov-2017.pdf"&gt;drinking could be dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, and research that indicates &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-016-0058-4"&gt;drinking is good for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Which is it? Obviously, too much drinking is bad for one’s health — and drinking to excess can destroy the human body. But is moderate drinking good — or, at least, fine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dylan Scott, Vox’s senior health reporter, has been &lt;a href="/health/403684/alcohol-drinking-health-effects-science"&gt;looking into this matter for some time&lt;/a&gt;, and I recently asked him to sum up what he’s learned. Here’s what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve done some reporting on alcohol recently and whether it’s safe. Is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is widespread agreement that heavy drinking is not good for you — doctors and scientists have known for literally centuries that a lot of drinking is dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the more you drink, the greater your risk. Your risk starts to increase pretty exponentially once you’re having more than one or two drinks at a given sitting, especially if you’re drinking every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is still a lot of debate about the safety of drinking small amounts of alcohol and whether it can have very small health benefits. On that front, studies can seem to contradict themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I talked to one scientist who has published some research documenting cardiovascular benefits from drinking a little bit of alcohol, and I also recently talked to the author of a 2017 statement from the leading cancer physician medical society, which was basically intended to be a wake-up call to the public that &lt;a href="https://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASCO-Alcohol-Cancer-Nov-2017.pdf"&gt;alcohol is a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet those two people, despite appearing to be on opposite sides of the debate, would basically be in total agreement, about the negative consequences of more than one drink for a woman every day or more than two drinks for a man every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yes, but let me take a step back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What has stuck out to me in reporting about alcohol is that the problem isn’t so much the substance itself as it is widespread misunderstanding about what moderate drinking means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s 12 oz. of a 5 percent beer, 1.5-oz. glass of 80-proof liquor, and 5 oz. of a 12 percent glass of wine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a trope among doctors that most people think they’re moderate drinkers but aren’t thinking about those numbers as they drink. I might pour a glass of wine and think I’m having one glass of wine, but a doctor would see two glasses of wine if it’s a really generous pour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Coming back to your question, if you didn’t know alcohol is a carcinogen, you’re not alone. I learned in my reporting that only 40 percent of people know alcohol is a carcinogen, which shows there’s still a lot of work to do in educating people about the health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Public health experts told me that they want to be more vocal about some of alcohol’s risks, especially about it being something that builds a dependency. Between that, and alcohol being a carcinogen, you can start to see why knowing what levels of drinking are actually moderate is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s interesting, and it makes me wonder about those headlines that claim a new study has found a glass of red wine a day is the key to longevity or something like that. Is there anything to those?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After my reporting, I do think there is some room for debate about whether a very modest amount of alcohol consumed in a very particular way might confer some small cardiovascular benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, even the doctor I talked to who’s authored studies finding some benefit, said, “This is not an elixir&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;” He was clear that his work shouldn’t be read as saying, “Alcohol is going to reduce your chance of diabetes, improve your heart health, or what have you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you’re saying I shouldn’t start drinking, hoping it will make me a healthier person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yes. The doctors I’ve spoken to have said things like, “I would never tell somebody to start drinking because it’s not going to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The basic thing to remember, though, is if you’re a light drinker, any potential problems caused by alcohol aren’t something worth worrying about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People should be aware of the risks but shouldn’t panic about them. Really, my two big takeaways on alcohol are: Heavy drinking is dangerous, and it’s easy to drink too much. Those are the things to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNMGZ0aDNlQlY4eXJ4S3Y5YXN2VWZabFRsWVV0cWJ5MFBpUGJnOTBuTEd2V25vN210Zm9OclZEU2gxMC1KV1Z1WlNvVW5BNk5ramZsSko4STIxLXJkOUN3blZhblpiRVdsd2dXamEzRGdsSVVkcVlNQTZaOTlUMDIzdU9OTUJtZElX</guid></item><item><title>储藏室生物黑客：我如何将生物学年龄降低10岁-每日邮报 | The pantry biohacker: how I reduced my biological age by 10 YEARS - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOUTJuMVF3NTlrVTItc0VkN3NFa05pdmRpLTZxYlN2SEozbThjVmxSZWJYUTktZG1xZl9aZTA2T3lZWnU1TGlTUXZ4LURQUmJXQzRZd0dpc2twcEVVQWJweko0NGhkZ1VVZjFsdjBWZHpMelN3R2ttYVlETnZld2ZNUm9FR2R5dFpfWjJrR2Y3cWpmaTRVSjg1R2x0dDVidnFWVDVJT2ozQkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity is having a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From tech billionaires testing stem cell transfusions from their teenage sons to hyperbaric oxygen chambers and infrared saunas, it seems 'reverse ageing' is the latest obsession of the super-rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the truth the wellness industry won't often admit: you don't need to be a Silicon Valley venture capitalist or spend tens of thousands on supplements and biohacking gadgets to reclaim your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can start in your pantry. And I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In my mid-forties, I decided to test a theory: could simple, consistent dietary changes improve not just my health, but reduce my biological age? By which I mean the measure of how well your body is functioning, as opposed to how many birthdays you've had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results - tracked through validated biological age testing methods - surprised even me. Within 18 months, I had reduced my biological age by just over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not with injections or cryotherapy, but with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not a marketing gimmick. It's the result of years of clinical knowledge, evidence-based nutrition and daily habits. My biological markers - inflammation, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial health, gut microbiome diversity - all improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I reduced my biological age by 10 years simply with food, writes nutritionist Faye James&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;You don't need to be a Silicon Valley venture capitalist or spend tens of thousands on supplements and biohacking gadgets to reclaim your health (Pictured: Bryan Johnson)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It proves that while ageing is inevitable, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; we age is far more malleable than we've been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what did I actually do? And what can you do too, without blowing your retirement fund on spurious and experimental treatments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;1. I replaced blood sugar spikes with metabolic stability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fastest way to accelerate ageing is to destabilise your blood sugar, and most of us are doing it daily, often without realising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The modern diet is laced with ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and hidden sugars, all of which create inflammation, fat storage and hormonal chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When blood sugar spikes and crashes repeatedly, it creates oxidative stress, damages blood vessels and accelerates cellular ageing. One of the most effective interventions I made was to front-load protein at every meal, particularly breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most Australians start their day with toast, cereal or a banana. I now start mine with a protein smoothie made with clean protein powder, Greek yoghurt, chia seeds, spinach and berries. Or I'll have eggs with leafy greens, cottage cheese and avocado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal is to hit 30 grams of protein at each meal, which supports muscle maintenance, reduces cravings and flattens the glucose curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I drink one cup of good-quality coffee in the morning, then switch to peppermint tea from mid-morning onwards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also began pairing all carbohydrates with protein and fat, which slows glucose absorption and keeps me feeling full and focused for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple tweaks like adding tahini to sweet potato, or hummus to crackers, have a profound cumulative effect on long-term metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;2. Eat more colourfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity isn't about eating less. It's about eating smarter, and more colourfully. The key dietary change I made wasn't what I took away, but what I added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I aimed for 30 different plant foods a week, including herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds. This diversity supports the gut microbiome, which is increasingly recognised as a central regulator of inflammation, immunity and even brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every meal became an opportunity to add something healing - a sprinkle of turmeric, a spoonful of fermented kraut, a handful of rocket or chopped parsley. I didn't diet; I curated. The more plants I added, the less room there was for processed fillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within months, my digestion improved, my skin glowed and my energy stabilised. And crucially, my inflammatory markers dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maintaining skeletal muscle is crucial in reducing your biological age - and this gets tougher after the age of 35 (picture posed by model)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;3. Prioritise key mitochondrial nutrients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mitochondria are the tiny powerhouses inside your cells responsible for energy production. But they are also deeply sensitive to poor diet, toxins and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ageing, at its core, is mitochondrial decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To support mine, I included key mitochondrial nutrients daily:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Magnesium from almonds, leafy greens and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Coenzyme Q10 (naturally occurring in oily fish and organ meats)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Polyphenols from blueberries, extra virgin olive oil and green tea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Sulforaphane from lightly steamed broccoli and cruciferous vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also began eating within a 12-hour window, finishing my last meal at 7pm then fasting overnight between dinner and breakfast after 7am. This allowed my body to shift into repair mode more often, supporting autophagy, the body's internal clean-up process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;4. The one-coffee rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress, both physical and emotional, is a silent accelerant. It drives up cortisol, disrupts sleep, dysregulates appetite and contributes to systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I used to rely on coffee to push through the day. Now, I drink one cup of high-quality coffee with food in the morning, and switch to peppermint tea by mid-morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Most Australians start their day with toast, cereal or a banana. I now start mine with a protein smoothie made with clean protein powder, Greek yoghurt, chia seeds, spinach and berries'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also added magnesium-rich foods, B vitamins from legumes and leafy greens, and started walking daily outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, m&lt;span&gt;y nervous system stopped living in fight-or-flight mode. That, more than anything, helped to reset my sleep, mood and metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;5. Strength-based workouts are essential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most underappreciated elements of longevity is skeletal muscle. From our mid-thirties, we lose muscle mass naturally - unless we fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle protects against insulin resistance, supports hormone production and improves physical resilience. I began resistance training three times a week - simple strength-based workouts with bodyweight, resistance bands and free weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest dietary support for this was adequate protein and leucine-rich foods such as tofu, lentils and tempeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein isn't just a weight loss tool; it's a longevity tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;6. I made everything from scratch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps the most radical shift I made - and the one people tend to resist the most - was giving up processed convenience foods altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I make everything at home. That includes sourdough bread, mayonnaise, salad dressings, sauces, stock, nut milks and even granola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nothing comes out of a bottle, nothing is pre-made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't about perfectionism; it's about having control of ingredients, additives and the inflammatory load you place on your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What most people don't realise is that even 'healthy' packaged foods are often ultra-processed. They contain seed oils, emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners and preservatives that disrupt the gut, affect insulin sensitivity and burden the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just because they are legal does not mean they are harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you cook from scratch, you remove that burden. You strip away the hidden sugars, synthetic fillers and additives designed to make food shelf-stable rather than nourishing. In their place, you reintroduce food that your cells recognise, nutrients your mitochondria can use, fibre your microbiome thrives on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I bake my own slow-fermented sourdough using organic flour and a live starter, rich in prebiotics that support gut health. I make salad dressings with extra virgin olive oil and apple cider vinegar, not refined canola and thickeners. My tomato sauces are made with real tomatoes and garlic, not powders or synthetic flavourings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These choices, replicated day after day, changed my inflammation profile, improved my digestion, and helped my body repair rather than simply function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I know what you're thinking - but it is not elitist to cook this way. Yes, it can be time-consuming, but it does not have to be complicated. Cooking from scratch can also be therapeutic in its slowness, and your body will thank you for the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In conclusion, growing older is nothing to shy away from - but feeling constantly tired, foggy, bloated or reliant on caffeine just to get through the day can wear you down and age you in all the wrong ways. If that's the result of pushing your body too hard and not giving it enough fuel, why wouldn't you make a change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wellness industry would have you believe the secret lies in expensive peptides, cryotherapy, ozone saunas or IV drips. And while those things may have their place, they are not what makes the greatest difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The greatest difference comes from consistency: What you eat at breakfast, what you leave out of your shopping trolley, what you choose to add to your plate when no one is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You don't need to be a billionaire with a lab in your basement to reduce your biological age. You just need a shopping list, a few good recipes and the willingness to commit to better living, day after day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I wrote The Long Life Plan because I believe longevity should be democratic. It should not be reserved for Rich Listers with personal chefs and biometric scanners. It should be achievable for anyone with a pantry, a stove and a body worth taking care of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That is the true biohack.

&lt;p&gt;In the world of &lt;strong&gt;viral research&lt;/strong&gt;, uncovering a &lt;strong&gt;virus’s weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt; is often a painstaking process that requires years of intricate study. But in a recent breakthrough, researchers have uncovered a surprisingly simple target in the &lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)&lt;/strong&gt;, the culprit behind &lt;strong&gt;cold sores&lt;/strong&gt;. What they found, however, is much more than a straightforward treatment target—it’s a deep, underlying mechanism that reshapes the very architecture of our &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; to support viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An Unexpected Genomic Hijack&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crg.eu/en/news/herpes-virus-plays-interior-designer-human-dna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Barcelona&lt;/strong&gt;, a team of researchers led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Esther González Almela&lt;/strong&gt; made an astonishing discovery: HSV-1 actively manipulates the &lt;strong&gt;3D structure&lt;/strong&gt; of the human genome to enhance its ability to reproduce. By hijacking the host’s genetic machinery, the virus ensures it gets easy access to the &lt;strong&gt;genes&lt;/strong&gt; it needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is an opportunistic interior designer, reshaping the human genome with great precision and choosing which bits it comes into contact with,” said Dr. González Almela. This form of manipulation, once unknown, shows how the virus takes control of the host in a way researchers had never previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Closer Look at Viral Replication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research provided new insights into how HSV-1 manipulates host cells to its advantage. Within hours of infection, the virus targets critical components of the host cell’s machinery, including the human &lt;strong&gt;RNA-polymerase II&lt;/strong&gt; enzyme, which helps it create proteins. Following this, enzymes like &lt;strong&gt;topoisomerase I&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cohesin&lt;/strong&gt; enter the viral replication sites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these components drive the virus’s replication process while also compressing the host’s &lt;strong&gt;chromatin&lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt;basically squeezing it into a dense shell&lt;/strong&gt;. This sequence of events was particularly unexpected, as it challenged the prior belief that gene transcription and chromatin structure are directly connected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Álvaro Castells García, co-first author of the study published in, emphasized the surprising nature of the findings. “We always thought dense chromatin shut genes down but here we see the opposite: stop enough transcription first and the &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; compacts afterward,” he explained. This new insight reshapes our understanding of how viruses manipulate &lt;strong&gt;genomic structure&lt;/strong&gt; to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Featured Image" data-lazy-src="https://sciencedaily.com/images/1920/Human-Cells-Before-and-After-Infection.webp"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://sciencedaily.com/images/1920/Human-Cells-Before-and-After-Infection.webp" alt="Featured Image"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human DNA in its natural state inside cells (left) compared to eight hours after being infected with HSV-1 (right). The virus compacts the human genome s size significantly and moves it towards the edge of the nucleus, freeing up space for the virus to set up a factory for its own purposes.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Targeting the Virus’s Weak Spot&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the team delved deeper into this complex interaction between HSV-1 and the human genome, they uncovered an important breakthrough. By blocking a single host enzyme—topoisomerase I—they were able to completely prevent the virus from rearranging the genome during infection. This stoppage halted the virus’s ability to &lt;strong&gt;replicate&lt;/strong&gt;, a significant step forward in the fight against HSV-1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ICREA &lt;strong&gt;Research Professor&lt;/strong&gt; Pia Cosma, a corresponding author of the study, noted that inhibiting this enzyme in cell culture “stopped the infection before the virus could make a single new particle,” revealing a potential new strategy for controlling the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery could mark a critical advancement in the development of &lt;strong&gt;antiviral therapies&lt;/strong&gt;. With the ability to halt the virus in its tracks before it replicates, researchers may now be closer than ever to addressing the global burden of HSV-1, which affects nearly &lt;strong&gt;four billion people&lt;/strong&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Global Health Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 is not just a nuisance for those who suffer from cold sores; it represents a major global health challenge. While most people with the virus remain asymptomatic or experience mild outbreaks, the infection can occasionally lead to severe complications, such as &lt;strong&gt;blindness&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;life-threatening diseases&lt;/strong&gt; in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. &lt;strong&gt;Drug-resistant strains&lt;/strong&gt; of HSV-1 are becoming increasingly common, adding to the urgency of finding more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread availability of treatments that manage symptoms, a cure for HSV-1 remains elusive. The study’s findings, however, offer hope that by targeting the mechanisms that allow the virus to manipulate the human genome, we may be on the verge of more &lt;strong&gt;effective, long-term treatments&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the viral takeover in focus, these recent developments could change the landscape of HSV-1 research and treatment, pushing scientists closer to a solution that could alleviate the widespread public health burden the virus continues to cause.&lt;/p&gt;

Tell us about the Music and Memory study.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;McCreedy: &lt;/b&gt;The principal investigator for the Music and Memory study is Dr. Vincent Mor. We randomly assigned nursing homes to either receive the early preferred music intervention or the usual care, which could include group music. But the real question was, can this early preferred music (ages 16 to 26) — the songs you listened to in high school with your friends, songs you got married to — be used at early signs of agitation, with the goal of reducing the burden of agitated behaviors in people living with dementia? And, can it help reduce the use of antipsychotics and other medications sometimes used to manage agitation, which can have dangerous side effects? The idea was, if we could intervene early with a safe and efficacious treatment, could we both decrease the behaviors and need for subsequent medication management?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What were some of the key findings? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The study showed that... early preferred music reduced the frequency of verbally agitated behaviors in people living in nursing homes who have dementia. That’s the main finding. ... Then the question is, do you decrease the medications that sometimes are used to manage the behavior? We did look at antipsychotics and we found that it does look like it reduces it, but ... we&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;can’t say definitively. We did not find that the intervention reduced physically agitated behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which sites participated in the study?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It was 976 residents from 54 nursing homes, 27 treatment centers, and 27 control. They were in the Midwest, in the central D.C. metro area, and in the South. We had a pretty racially diverse sample. About 25 percent of our sample was African American.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you do if you don’t know a resident’s musical preference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We have a paper that shows it took 2 1/2 hours on average – or two or three sittings – to find residents’ musical preference. Often, you’re in a situation where someone is a good candidate for intervention, but we don’t have any idea what their musical preference is. We started with Billboard lists in different genres and different decades, and we’ve modified them to be a little more regionally specific, site specific, so we can get a bit more tailored to the top 10. An activity staff sat and played the music for the resident and looked for positive responses — tapping, vocalizations of any sort, just an awakening or increase in attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you see your research being used in emotion recognition apps, artificial intelligence, or mental health tools?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yes, there are big barriers to scale here and so we’re trying to target the different pieces that affect getting this to everybody, especially older adults living with dementia, wherever they are living. But there could be broader uses of preferred music for reducing isolation and loneliness in healthy adults. ... We have a pilot to look at smartwatch-detected stress and map it to human-observed agitation, which is what we do a lot of in our lab. There’s a lot we could do if we know when a person is starting to get agitated. We’re thinking about technology in the form of consumer wearables to detect agitation and make playlists based on affect and response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about the effort that was needed to gather the data for this study? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This research would not be possible — 100 percent — without our nursing home partners and the staff that are already working so very hard. This is one of those environments that the people are doing the best work in, and not getting enough pay for what they do. I would recommend everybody go and volunteer at a nursing home and see how hard these folks are working and how much they care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe’s weekly Ocean State Innovators column features a Q&amp;amp;A with Rhode Island innovators who are starting new businesses and nonprofits, conducting groundbreaking research, and reshaping the state’s economy.

Researchers hoped her brain would unlock new insights into the long-term effects of gene therapy, as one of the study's longest-living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But after Ashtyn's death in December, the frozen part of her brain never made it to a research facility in Ohio, as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Instead, it was mistakenly discarded by Children's Wisconsin, the family alleged in a lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/donated-brain-thrown-out-childrens-wisconsin-profoundly-sorry" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.fox6now.com/news/donated-brain-thrown-out-childrens-wisconsin-profoundly-sorry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;first reported by WITI-TV (Channel 6)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Family seeks answers for how daughter's brain was lost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Fellenz family alleges the hospital system mishandled Ashtyn's brain tissue and behaved negligently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They want answers to how the hospital system could have thrown away half her brain. The lawsuit called the loss a "scientific tragedy" that "undermines decades of work." It also irreversibly altered the legacy that the Fellenz family had envisioned for their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's already bad enough losing your child, but that was like literally losing her again, for a second time," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/20/PMJS/84286522007-ashtyn-and-alexis-fellenz.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=494&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/20/PMJS/84286522007-ashtyn-and-alexis-fellenz.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=988&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Ashtyn Fellenz, left, with her sister Alexis Fellenz.

Her parents realized something was wrong when months-old Ashtyn began missing developmental milestones. She couldn't hold up her head; her vision wasn't developing properly; she was "like a rag doll," her mother Arlo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It wasn't long before they got a diagnosis: Canavan disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Canavan is a rare, hereditary disease that over time, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6013-canavan-disease" data-type="link" data-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6013-canavan-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;causes the brain to deteriorate&lt;/a&gt; into spongy tissue with lots of tiny, fluid-filled spaces.

Surgeons drilled holes into the skull and injected billions of viral particles containing healthy genes directly into the brain. Ashtyn had just turned 3 years old when she underwent the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the following years, she traveled back to the east coast frequently for follow-up visits, to take images of her brain and monitor her response to the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She showed improvements. She was able to move her head from side to side and even lift her arms and legs in ways she couldn't before, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in a 2004 story, a year after her surgery. There was a new brightness to her facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the treatment could only do so much. Ashtyn had already lost much of her brain tissue to the disease. She still could not walk or talk. She ate through a feeding tube. She required constant care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her mother Arlo took painstaking care of her, effectively becoming her round-the-clock nurse. She would wake up in the middle of the night to fill her feeding bag. She would monitor her oxygen levels. She would use suction and cough assist machines to remove fluids from her airways. Ashtyn's care was so complex that Arlo had to train a lot of the nurses who, over the years, helped care for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Her bedroom was like an ICU," Arlo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/09/PMJS/84119648007-gmti-photoj-2004-q-3-m-07-t-26-h-12431900-jff.JPG?width=660&amp;amp;height=467&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/09/PMJS/84119648007-gmti-photoj-2004-q-3-m-07-t-26-h-12431900-jff.JPG?width=1320&amp;amp;height=934&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Speech pathologist Rona Alexander works with Ashtyn Fellenz, as her mother, Arlo Clark-Fellenz, holds a mirror to stimulate Ashtyn's vision in 2004.

"It has to be done as quick as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The children part of Ashtyn's clinical trial had hailed from Europe, South America and the United States. She was the longest-surviving U.S. patient who had gotten the treatment, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Paola Leone, one of the researchers who has been with the Fellenz family from the beginning, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8A-GIMjEJBw?t=2892" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/8A-GIMjEJBw?t=2892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;delivered Ashtyn's eulogy&lt;/a&gt;.

She directed a staff member to move forward with sending the brain tissue to Dayton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But two months later, in March, the Dayton hospital still had not received the specimens. And Leone's emails to Children's Wisconsin inquiring about the status of the shipment went unanswered, the Fellenz family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Arlo called one of her contacts at Children's for help getting answers. Later that month, she got on a conference call with Children's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They had accidentally discarded her brain," Arlo recalled hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It turned out only one half of Ashtyn's brain had apparently been discarded. The other half, set in formalin, was eventually sent to the Dayton hospital, the Fellenz's said. But it was the frozen half, they said, that was more important for the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The news was devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It was always a little comfort that she was still living on," Scott said. "It's heartbreaking. ...

But it had been a comfort knowing she was "living in a big way" and would have a big impact on research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It meant everything to have that legacy for her," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They're still processing the loss.

                Heat makes it harder to sleep. In Baghdad, some neighbors set up mattresses on their roof to find a cool sleeping spot. A new study finds the risk of sleep apnea goes up along with temperatures.

   &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the feeling: tossing and turning during a hot, sticky night when sleep feels impossible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's hard for anyone to sleep well when it's hot out. And the disruptions are growing, especially for those suffering from sleep apnea, as climate change pushes up temperatures day and night around the globe. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60218-1" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications &lt;/em&gt;found that the chance of having any kind of sleep apnea problem overnight goes up by almost 50% when it's 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, compared to when temperatures are in the 50s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the severe cases — when people stop breathing more than 30 times in a single hour — go up, too. "You also increase the likelihood of having severe sleep apnea by 40%," says Bastien Lechat, a sleep expert at Flinders University in Australia and the lead author of the new study. "It's a striking number."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In sleep apnea, people's breathing stops and starts while they rest. The disorder can keep people's bodies from getting enough oxygen and disrupts sleep. An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60218-1#ref-CR19" target="_blank"&gt;one billion people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide deal with sleep apnea, though it's underdiagnosed, says Lechat. And the impacts of so much disrupted sleep are hefty. People's moods and ability to work are affected, and sleep loss contributes to many other health problems from heart attacks to strokes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We all know what it means to have a bad night of sleep," says Sara Mednick, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. But science shows that the cumulative impacts of bad sleep, she says, trickle out beyond the person feeling tired. "It's a whole global problem that we need to really think about," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study used about two years of sleep data from more than 125,000 people, in 41 different countries worldwide.The data tracked detected sleep disruptions with sensors placed under people's mattresses and tracked changes in sleep apnea incidents over time, and compared that sleep data with temperature where people lived. As temperatures climbed, people's sleep apnea got worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The risk of having a severe sleep apnea event when it was very hot out nearly doubled in many northern countries, like Europe and Russia. It went up by about 40% in countries like the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Lechat thinks the differences might stem from air conditioning access — one factor the study couldn't take into account. Fewer people in Europe use air conditioners than in the U.S. or Australia, leaving people exposed to the full impact of hotter temperatures day and night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Climate change has pushed up global temperatures over the past few decades, and that extra heat is costing people sleep already, the study found. The U.K, for example, has warmed just over a degree Fahrenheit since 2000; the overall health cost from heat-worsened sleep apnea issues grew by more than 90% as time passed and temperatures climbed. As temperatures rise further, the impacts will also grow, Mednick says .&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As temperature gets higher, our sleep quality gets lower," she says. And that means "we are just going to continue to lose sleep" as climate change marches forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other recent studies found that climate change is disrupting sleep for people without disorders like sleep apnea, too. &lt;a href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/321112/1-s2.0-S2590332221X00061/1-s2.0-S2590332222002093/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEK7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIEuPMV57xry8W%2FOxrI%2FENjcTDxXHYTdtV1o09TFvMS%2BkAiBLCdLox1efWuul%2Fd6k12R17B%2FQFWGBPutmMn9egBUFgiq8BQiX%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAUaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIMfS5SmS1CDcwZ2YdwKpAFWHuaiBYqx2AEKc14LiXB%2BWcnjwA%2FAFuTjbrVMCZ12cKmh%2BKX6RHMx4IoAZ3qQsut97LmWG5TrlOxDMt8Lo502y1Nr2pij5De0%2Bd%2FINNGI6MW6KgjODGK1MVyh9ep7BurnBZTJKlpQmX8bBv3H%2Bq4ei0v9Lql59RaHwxAcXUV5OKVDz24UNZK3cWdjiC%2Bsley9AL7Lf8%2FAY13hKCFtXhfVf14CBLh8UTfj2BBRXNH5LwHj2LpXq5Ga4BJMqn%2Fh2emwwMmKvXVmor%2BlJJ8iQF9pJo6uLs2QQgrzB1hTi3EQpNcfr7Aj%2BI0RP65T9CBYBHZHRS9zwj1nH9tBzx5qTp5cXxxiFSaPGka67YtmAgR6eG87CJh0oaTrd3ZlCIEvHVXuxgdRSbvwfqu6Ywja6NVd8pnQCJp8OEMDsrNCafoW8NQ3JaIy8CaLGZNS4MaDZmZfhTyekpIZb2ErHsJBtkgTq4T%2FOqCJtr8AF0A%2Bn4B1JQkL0PhY8fq9nZNofXQ39prmAFvwlI7yaoPCNYiQBrquLbzjqd67eDWbPq82IY2Px0%2BkkGzWZDVS106w7zxlmGSGhAGTMMG%2Fc%2FmA8VK2VFAIErq1vLCTyOWThHikGZ5dG9M21SpdRE6U77gyydvBIqatjK80FrOphuBjrQrrchP2Battvnay2%2Baq9nMGR9ph1dY0cYolfeJ0I3c3sqx8RHoN2gud6%2FadzlOBK76tFTROToqXntkIUwnXFPr3mJgymqXyjTbE%2FvE9SBbn%2FNP76JIZ%2B7hKAvIvl2kLc6WJVDmyHGOU6DHQab7C2ENZEwzZU3jluC86zdPXEyoHmk99KVH%2BEqzMkBzsEBz41yhrXhNbLbB%2BpHE%2BIdDpODR7RF8qZAwgeTMwgY6sgFmmb4vo8nEqr5323UovJ8kfWGg3EBfXKnMUP30nyP1eKxg%2F2VyBW8esh96M5NVhsmb%2FVHbHKFIH5ToLb8n5rNpnHW73xO1sGuBzXwKR7yEp71Mw7DgiaveVe0xDmh%2F1lUNhqyuW7T5st2mLBu%2BnvNoqcLnrn8XUesI82D4vK0%2Fuimriiq04%2Be0Qx5%2BtsolNpQGx%2Bjl104dPeE0sMvf%2B7AYRtQyTyqcb1GqhQKAePDDdVu2&amp;amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20250618T225407Z&amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYXBVHC5OR%2F20250618%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=9b6771aabf0d7e2ddc16f2fddfa1baf51305bc84ee0d39f946777e8314cb649f&amp;amp;hash=36b351f52a181de024cdddfa9ecc0c872d7798252e669dff7c9e7ce2c42c794a&amp;amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;amp;pii=S2590332222002093&amp;amp;tid=spdf-2d67f9d0-e952-47c4-b1d5-ace3c4c90160&amp;amp;sid=267133536888e8472a5be579f1887af1a786gxrqa&amp;amp;type=client&amp;amp;tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&amp;amp;rh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&amp;amp;ua=13105655520252060206&amp;amp;rr=951e5dde3e5e14f8&amp;amp;cc=us" target="_blank"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; using millions of Fitbit sleep records worldwide found that people fell asleep later, woke up earlier, and slept more poorly as temperatures went up — and that people didn't get better at dealing with the heat over time. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57781-y" target="_blank"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; in China found that a 10-degree Celsius (18-degree Fahrenheit) jump in temperatures cut sleep time by about 10 minutes per night in China.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message from those studies, and the new research, is unambiguous, says Nick Obradovich, a data scientist at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Oklahoma, who worked on several sleep-and-climate focused studies in the past but was not involved in the new study. "As temperatures increase, people sleep less well across all the measures, across all the places that we've seen so far."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To reclaim good sleep, Obradovich says, the first goal is stopping temperatures from rising more. But controlling your sleep environment likely helps too, by cooling it down with fans or air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"My worry is for people who can't do that," Lechat says. For people in vast swaths of Earth without access to cooling, the future looks hotter and filled with more sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

However, no evidence has appeared of increased COVID-19-related hospital admissions, deaths per hospitalizations, or all-cause mortality associated with the variant, the WHO report stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Look for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of the NB.1.8.1 variant appear to be similar to prior variants of the virus, with such presenting symptoms as fever, headache, cough, runny nose, fatigue, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, said Shirin Mazumder, MD, an infectious diseases specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sore throat is a common symptom of COVID-19 that occurs in upward of 70% of patients,” said Mazumder. Although some reports describe the sore throat associated with NB.1.8.1 as “razor blade” in terms of severity, whether this symptom is distinctive of the new variant remains unclear, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for any added severity, the NB.1.8.1 variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, Mazumder told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;. “Although most people will recover after a COVID-19 infection, some will require hospital admission, and some will go on to develop long COVID, which we have seen with other variants,” she said. However, overall hospitalizations resulting from COVID-19 in the US are currently stable, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Vaccine Still Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition regularly assesses how well the available COVID-19 vaccines are performing against any variants. Currently, the group advises that monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 are appropriate COVID-19 vaccine antigens, with monovalent LP.8.1 as an alternative vaccine antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, no studies have reported any impact of NB.1.8.1 on clinical outcomes, and no available evidence suggests resistance to nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), according to the WHO. However, the effectiveness of the current COVID vaccine against this variant remains unclear at present, Mazumder told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some reports that the NB.1.8.1 variant exhibits signs of immune escape, which may lower the immunity provided by vaccines and prior infection,” she noted. Yet, the variant is descended from the omicron lineage for which the current vaccine is effective, and ideally it will retain some prevention activity against NB.1.8.1 as well, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mazumder had no financial conflicts to disclose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 09:29:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNMnFvUF9ja3V4MUJDYzNXR0ZrcUxnYU13andOSWVBcm04V2swbXB2YlU2UjBlU3Vqa3JlYWVHejZCYjkxRTltdUNKMjVXbWxDamtpYldNZ3pzZkh0STc3NTRpY0lQS3NSWnpnaElQZlZVR2NDNjFiQzAyZldBc0o0cXBqNUlQcGgxRGdSdw</guid></item><item><title>每天吃一个苹果真的对你的健康有好处吗？ - BBC | Is an apple a day really good for your health? - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOWFCN0tOTG9oMG4xRHZUdF91WjVIbmNvekRXN1VQTlpKOG5iSlhnX21hWkhUa3RRdHZzS1gyLTdzVGZOSFRzbzIwTlRHbzR5RGExWWZpUmozQ2I5S0hJM3hEY21wcHVYaUlqcE5Kcm93MXhCMGFDdWZIRFhMQWctWGw2cjZsVjhwcEw5QTROUDVja2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Is an apple a day really good for your health?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lkj9kr.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A close up of a pile of red apples (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="we're-told-an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away,-but-does-this-humble-fruit-really-have-an-outsized-positive-effect-on-our-health?" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;We're told an apple a day keeps the doctor away, but does this humble fruit really have an outsized positive effect on our health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The popular phrase "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" originates from a slightly wordier Welsh proverb written in 1866: "Eat an apple on going to bed and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But is there any truth at the core of this longstanding maxim?

In several papers, scientists recommend regular apple-eating because the fruits are simply so widely available. That means that eating them regularly is something that is relatively achievable for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lkj9xs.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images People who eat apples, studies suggest, are overall healthier (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;People who eat apples, studies suggest, are overall healthier (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's clear that apples have the potential to improve our health.

One of those groups ate two apples per day while the other had an apple drink with similar calories. The experiment lasted eight weeks and, apart from the apple products, the participants didn't make any other changes to their diets. The researchers found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)01006-1/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the apple-eaters had a clinically significant  lower level of cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the study.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn-led researchers have turned a deadly fungus into a potent cancer-fighting compound. After isolating a new class of molecules from Aspergillus flavus, a toxic crop fungus linked to deaths in the excavations of ancient tombs, the researchers modified the chemicals and tested them against leukemia cells. The result? A promising cancer-killing compound that rivals FDA-approved drugs and opens up new frontiers in the discovery of more fungal medicines.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;"Fungi gave us penicillin," says Sherry Gao, Presidential Penn Compact Associate Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) and in Bioengineering (BE) and senior author of a new paper in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-025-01946-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Chemical Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on the findings. "These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From curse to cure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus flavus, named for its yellow spores, has long been a microbial villain. After archaeologists opened King Tutankhamun's tomb in the 1920s, a series of untimely deaths among the excavation team fueled rumors of a pharaoh's curse. Decades later, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)14268-7/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;doctors theorized&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fungal+spores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fungal spores&lt;/a&gt;, dormant for millennia, could have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, a dozen scientists entered the tomb of Casimir IV in Poland. Within weeks, 10 of them died. &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/the-past/mummys-curse-fungus-mold-aspergillus/" target="_blank"&gt;Later investigations revealed&lt;/a&gt; the tomb contained A. flavus, whose toxins can lead to lung infections, especially in people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that same fungus is the unlikely source of a promising new cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A rare fungal find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy in question is a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs, pronounced like the "rip" in a piece of fabric. The name refers to how the compound is produced—by the ribosome, a tiny cellular structure that makes proteins—and the fact that it is modified later, in this case, to enhance its cancer-killing properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Purifying these chemicals is difficult," says Qiuyue Nie, a postdoctoral fellow in CBE and the paper's first author. While thousands of RiPPs have been identified in bacteria, only a handful have been found in fungi. In part, this is because past researchers misidentified fungal RiPPs as non-ribosomal peptides and had little understanding of how fungi created the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The synthesis of these compounds is complicated," adds Nie. "But that's also what gives them this remarkable bioactivity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hunting for chemicals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more fungal RiPPs, the researchers first scanned a dozen strains of Aspergillus, which previous research suggested might contain more of the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing chemicals produced by these strains with known RiPP building blocks, the researchers identified A. flavus as a promising candidate for further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis pointed to a particular protein in A. flavus as a source of fungal RiPPs. When the researchers turned the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; that create that protein off, the chemical markers indicating the presence of RiPPs also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel approach—combining metabolic and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic information&lt;/a&gt;—not only pinpointed the source of fungal RiPPs in A. flavus, but could be used to find more fungal RiPPs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A potent new medicine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After purifying four different RiPPs, the researchers found the molecules shared a unique structure of interlocking rings. The researchers named these molecules, which have never been previously described, after the fungus in which they were found: asperigimycins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with no modification, when mixed with human cancer cells, asperigimycins demonstrated medical potential: two of the four variants had potent effects against &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/leukemia+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;leukemia cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another variant, to which the researchers added a lipid, or fatty molecule, that is also found in the royal jelly that nourishes developing bees, performed as well as cytarabine and daunorubicin, two FDA-approved drugs that have been used for decades to treat leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cracking the code of cell entry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why lipids enhanced asperigimycins' potency, the researchers selectively turned genes on and off in the leukemia cells. One gene, SLC46A3, proved critical in allowing asperigimycins to enter leukemia cells in sufficient numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gene helps materials exit lysosomes, the tiny sacs that collect foreign materials entering human cells. "This gene acts like a gateway," says Nie. "It doesn't just help asperigimycins get into cells, it may also enable other 'cyclic peptides' to do the same."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like asperigimycins, those chemicals have medicinal properties—nearly two dozen cyclic peptides have received clinical approval since 2000 to treat diseases as varied as cancer and lupus—but many of them need modification to enter cells in sufficient quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Knowing that lipids can affect how this gene transports chemicals into cells gives us another tool for drug development," says Nie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Disrupting cell division&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through further experimentation, the researchers found that asperigimycins likely disrupt the process of cell division. "Cancer cells divide uncontrollably," says Gao. "These compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are essential for cell division."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the compounds had little to no effect on breast, liver or lung cancer cells—or a range of bacteria and fungi—suggesting that asperigimycins' disruptive effects are specific to certain types of cells, a critical feature for any future medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to demonstrating the medical potential of asperigimycins, the researchers identified similar clusters of genes in other fungi, suggesting that more fungal RiPPS remain to be discovered. "Even though only a few have been found, almost all of them have strong bioactivity," says Nie. "This is an unexplored region with tremendous potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to test asperigimycins in animal models, with the hope of one day moving to human clinical trials. "Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy," says Gao. "It's up to us to uncover its secrets. As engineers, we're excited to keep exploring, learning from nature and using that knowledge to design better solutions."&lt;/p&gt;

                Ticks can carry &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; different disease-causing agents, including toxins, allergens, bacteria, parasites and viruses.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are early signs that it could be a bad year for tick bites. In May, the rate of people seeking emergency care for tick bites was the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tick-bite-data-tracker.html" target="_blank"&gt;highest it's been&lt;/a&gt; since 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you get a tick bite, you're not alone: They happen in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/geographic-distribution-of-tickborne-disease-cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;every U.S. state&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877959X24001092?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;31 million people&lt;/a&gt; get tick bites each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not every tick bite yields disease, since not every tick carries pathogens or bites long enough to transmit them. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/media/pdfs/2024/05/VBD-National-Strategy-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;most reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of vector-borne disease (including mosquitoes) come from ticks, which can carry pathogens with terrible consequences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the U.S., estimated to affect more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;470,000 people&lt;/a&gt; each year.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But ticks can actually expose people in the U.S. to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; different disease-causing agents," including toxins, allergens, bacteria, parasites and viruses, says Alison Hinckley, an epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. "The illnesses can range from mild to life-threatening," Hinckley adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are facts to know about these biting critters and tips to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Ticks are slow threats, so prompt action cuts your risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With ticks — unlike mosquitoes with their one-and-done sting — there are generally multiple opportunities to reduce your risks. That's because most kinds of ticks need to crawl onto your body, latch into the skin and, in many cases, feed for a while — from several hours to several days — before they get you sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73795" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"The longer a tick is attached, the more likely it is to have spit an infectious dose of whatever germ it might be carrying into you," says &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/pse/meet/thomas-mather/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Mather&lt;/a&gt;, director of the University of Rhode Island's Center for Vector-Borne Disease and founder of its &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/" target="_blank"&gt;TickEncounter Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ticks, with their tiny crawling legs, don't go very far on their own, so they're often picked up outside or brought into living spaces on animals, whether they be pests or pets. So, if you're spending time outside, follow this guidance from CDC experts:&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do careful and frequent tick checks on yourself and your family members and pets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you find a tick on you, take it off as soon as you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're hiking, it helps to &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/ticksmart-tips/tip-9-stay-in-the-middle-of-trails/" target="_blank"&gt;stay in the middle&lt;/a&gt; of a well-maintained trail, since ticks tend to hang out in the shrubs and foliage around the edge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treat outdoor clothing &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/09/625459326/to-repel-ticks-try-spraying-your-clothes-with-a-pesticide-derived-from-mums" target="_blank"&gt;with permethrin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical similar to chrysanthemum extracts that stops ticks from biting. Additionally, treat your exposed skin with EPA-registered &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;insect repellents&lt;/a&gt; containing DEET, picaridin, or other active ingredients that deter ticks. (Use the EPA's &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you" target="_blank"&gt;search tool&lt;/a&gt; to find one that works.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Risks differ in the North, South and West&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The risks of getting a tick-borne disease like Lyme or relapsing fever vary by region, depending on what ticks are around, what they're carrying, and how likely they are to come in contact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To see which tick-borne diseases have been found in your area, you can check historic data (2019-2022) by county &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/geographic-distribution-of-tickborne-disease-cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;on a CDC map&lt;/a&gt;, and in many cases, state and local health department websites, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/4872/thomas-m-hart" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Hart&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Broadly, the CDC divides the country into three regions when it comes to ticks:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North: &lt;/strong&gt;Tick bites are most common in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest, with nearly 20% of people getting them each year, and much of the region is considered to be at high risk for Lyme disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877959X24001092?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;research from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The bacteria that causes Lyme, &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi,&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703795/" target="_blank"&gt;most common pathogen&lt;/a&gt; carried by deer ticks in this region — up to 30% of ticks in the nymphal stage and up to 60% of adult ticks carry it, says Rebecca Eisen, a research biologist in the Division of Vector-borne Diseases at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ticks in this area carry other pathogens, but far less commonly — 2% to 6% of ticks may be carrying bacteria that cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/anaplasmosis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;anaplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/babesiosis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;babesiosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;relapsing fever&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South:&lt;/strong&gt; In the Central and Southeastern parts of the U.S. (including Texas), around 13% of people report getting tick bites. There, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;ehrlichiosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;spotted fever rickettsioses&lt;/a&gt; and the allergic condition &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt; are the top concerns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The somewhat lower incidence of tick bites in Southern states may be related to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7677222/" target="_blank"&gt;how the tick populations behave&lt;/a&gt;, Eisen says. In Northern states, they tend to crawl up to the surface of leaf litter and tall grasses, while in Southern states, they stay closer to the soil level, making them less likely to cling onto a human arm or leg. Eisen says these differences are likely driven by genetics, based on how generations of ticks changed over time. "I think it's just a function of what survived," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West: &lt;/strong&gt;In Western states (including California), tick bites are considerably less common, but they do happen — around 6% of people report getting them, according to CDC research. Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are some of the diseases &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/fieldguide/" target="_blank"&gt;people get there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73789" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What to do if you get bitten&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you do get bitten, you should remove the tick right away. Don't toss it immediately, advises Mather at URI, because identifying some key information about the tick can help determine your risks. That includes what kind of tick it is, whether it's in the nymph or adult stage and how long it's been feeding on you.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;To figure this out, you can &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/fieldguide/" target="_blank"&gt;compare what you find&lt;/a&gt; with diagrams provided by the URI's Tick Encounter website. If you get stuck, you can submit a &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/submit/" target="_blank"&gt;clear photo of your tick&lt;/a&gt; from the top, and Mather and his team will try to help figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or take your tick — wrapped in tape, or in a plastic bag — to the doctor if you're seeking medical care. Seeing what type of tick it is and how long it's fed on you can help medical providers determine if you're at risk of Lyme or other diseases, Hinckley says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But sending them in for testing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;isn't all that helpful&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC, because the results often don't lead to actionable advice. If the tick is positive for a pathogen, it &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/testing/" target="_blank"&gt;doesn't necessarily mean&lt;/a&gt; you've been infected. And if you do develop symptoms of a tick-borne disease, you're better off seeking medical treatment right away instead of waiting for the tick testing results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;When to seek medical care&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In places where Lyme disease is common, finding an engorged adult deer tick (&lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/fieldguide/tick-growth-comparison-charts/" target="_blank"&gt;like the ones pictured here&lt;/a&gt;) could mean you should seek care right away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The only time you would get an antibiotic, after a tick bite and before any symptoms, would be to prevent Lyme disease," says Hinckley with the CDC. "And in that case, we recommend just a single dose."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In most other cases, you may be advised to monitor yourself for symptoms in the days and weeks after the bite.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In a lot of cases, if you're seeing something right away after a tick bite, it could just be a hypersensitivity reaction — a little redness — that doesn't require a visit to a health care provider," Hinckley says. "But if it's a few days later and you start to experience aches and pains, fever, and — for a lot of these different tick borne diseases — a rash can occur. For those symptoms, seeing a health care provider as soon as you can would be important."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hinckley recommends telling the provider about your tick bite, your symptoms and where you were — the state, the county — when you picked up the tick. "It can help them decide what diseases you might be at risk for," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a lot to figure out on your own, so you can check the University of Rhode Island's &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/fieldguide/" target="_blank"&gt;TickEncounter&lt;/a&gt; and the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/communication-resources/tick-bite-bot-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Tick Bite Bot&lt;/a&gt; for help determining next steps.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Ticks-borne diseases are spreading to new areas — stay informed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ticks and the diseases they carry are on the rise, and on the move. In the past 20 years, scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/media/pdfs/2024/05/VBD-National-Strategy-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;discovered at least&lt;/a&gt; seven new tick-borne pathogens in the U.S., and reported cases of disease have more than doubled, according to a 2024 CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Changes in climate, particularly warming in the Northern Hemisphere, play a big role in expanding the areas where ticks can survive, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/4363/nicole-baumgarth" target="_blank"&gt;Nicole Baumgarth&lt;/a&gt;, director of Johns Hopkins University's Lyme and Tickborne Diseases Research and Education Institute. So does reforestation, which brings more deer, birds and rodents. "When we live in these wooded areas, we are really getting into the way of millions of years of evolution between the ticks, the mammals and the bacterium," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People and their medical providers are also more aware of ticks in their areas and the diseases they carry, which leads to more cases being confirmed, Baumgarth says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there are risks coming to new areas that weren't seen before. Since the early 1990s, Lyme disease has gone from being "really unknown" to becoming established in &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease-surveillance-report-2019.html" target="_blank"&gt;parts of southern Canada&lt;/a&gt;, says Baumgarth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the mid-Atlantic recently saw its first fatal case of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36821867/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartland Virus&lt;/a&gt;. "The fact that we are now seeing these virus infections in areas where we haven't seen them before is probably a tip of the iceberg," Baumgarth says, since it likely means there are more cases that aren't being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the South and West are also tracking &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/about/about-strf.html" target="_blank"&gt;soft-tick relapsing fever&lt;/a&gt;, a condition caused by the bites of soft-bodied ticks, which lack a hard shell and tend to be found in areas where bats and rodents live. While just &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7229a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;250 cases were reported&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC from 2012-2021, the symptoms — high fevers, chills, nausea — can be often misdiagnosed as influenza, COVID-19, even malaria, says &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/job-lopez-25566" target="_blank"&gt;Job Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, a tick researcher at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1990s, the AIDS epidemic had become a pandemic, with more than 3 million new HIV infections and more than 1 million AIDS-related deaths each year. A million children, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, had been orphaned by AIDS. The numbers just kept going up and up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 1995, the first protease inhibitor was approved by the FDA. Saquinavir was developed by Roche and proved to be a game-changer in the fight against HIV. A cocktail of one protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was shown in trials to reduce viral loads to very low levels for up to a year. When these findings were announced at a conference in Vancouver, attendees gave a standing ovation, hugged each other, and cried. This so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART, would be a lifesaver for thousands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But those early regimes were by no means ideal. People with HIV had to take up to 30 tablets a day, at specific times. Missing scheduled doses could mean drug resistance and therapy failure. The debilitating side effects included ’round-the-clock nausea and diarrhea. Often the medication would significantly change the shape of a person’s face and upper body, due to the loss or redistribution of fat under the skin, telegraphing their disease to the world. Many found these outcomes so intolerable they would give up their lifesaving medicine: Nearly a quarter of patients discontinued HAART within the first eight months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who persisted with treatment, drug resistance remained a looming threat that might render their therapy ineffective at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, there was the cost of the drugs, making them inaccessible to millions of people in less wealthy nations. By the start of the new millennium, there was still huge unmet need in the treatment of HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tomas Cihlar got interested in viruses at an early age. “I was fascinated with the biology world, and viruses in general,” says Cihlar. “They’re perfect small parasites, hijacking perfectly healthy cells and turning them upside down to work for the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His biochemistry Ph.D. brought him into the orbit of an antiviral legend, Antonín Holý, at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB) in Prague. Holý was working on molecules to counter the herpes virus, and he invited Cihlar to join his lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holý was a key player in a highly productive partnership between the IOCB, the Rega Institute in Belgium, and a small Californian biotech start-up called Gilead Sciences. Founded just a few years earlier, Gilead did not yet have any commercial products, but they had investors and they had vision. Through Holý’s friendship with Gilead’s head of R&amp;amp;D, John Martin, the young Cihlar found himself offered a postdoctoral fellowship in California. “I kind of sneaked through the back door,” he says, smiling. It wasn’t long before he was drawn to the company’s HIV program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Tomas is a spectacular person,” says John Link, a medicinal chemist. “He’s an incredibly unusual combination of a drug discoverer and a very academic thinker. They’re usually two separate universes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The big breakthrough, for both Gilead and Cihlar, came in 2001, when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was approved for use against HIV. At a time when resistance was mounting against all existing HIV drugs, TDF became a lifeline for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was the seed of the whole Gilead HIV portfolio,” says Cihlar. Gilead combined TDF with another antiviral, emtricitabine, giving us one of the most important HIV treatments so far created. The combination is still prescribed to millions of people. Its approval in 2004 set Gilead on course to become the leading player in HIV therapeutics. And that’s when Cihlar, by now Gilead’s leading virologist, started wondering about new potential targets in the virus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The drugs available to people with HIV had turned the disease from a death sentence into a chronic condition, but many of them still had potential side effects, and the threat of drug resistance hovered over all of them. There were the protease inhibitors, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. All of them targeted HIV enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Was there a completely different target they could try?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Cihlar came across a paper by Wes Sundquist, who was investigating the unusual, conelike structure of the HIV capsid. Written four years earlier, it described the mutation studies that showed how small alterations in the HIV capsid massively diminished the infectivity of the virus. The mutants created by Sundquist and von Schwedler had been further investigated by another capsid expert, Christopher Aiken of Vanderbilt University, who developed an assay to measure the stability of the HIV capsid. Using this innovative tool, Aiken was able to show that Sundquist’s mutations either &lt;em&gt;increased &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;decreased &lt;/em&gt;capsid stability. Both variations diminished viral infectivity. “It’s sort of the Goldilocks hypothesis, right?” explains Aiken. The capsid, he showed, needs to be “not too stable, not too unstable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was very clear that a few single amino acid mutations in the capsid basically killed the virus,” recalls Cihlar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, Cihlar still viewed the capsid as little more than a canister protecting HIV’s genes and enzymes, but he could also see that it was a precision-built structure that had to come together in a certain sequence and at certain exact angles. Such intricacy, he felt, might be disrupted by a small molecule drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His colleagues were dubious. Drug hunters like targeting enzymes because they have evolved to bind to molecules. Structural proteins like the capsid protein are generally thought not to have the same druggable binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the high concentration of capsid protein that accumulates in infectious HIV particles presented a challenge: A well-designed small molecule might take out some of it, but most researchers thought that reaching all of it would likely require intolerable concentrations of the drug in the patient’s bloodstream. One molecule discovered in 2003 seemed to bind to the capsid and was claimed to have weak antiviral activity, but that line of inquiry had led nowhere. Most of the HIV research community considered the capsid undruggable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, he persisted, reading all the literature on the HIV capsid, visiting Sundquist’s lab in Salt Lake City, and slowly building the case for a capsid-targeting program. The two men became friends, and they both agreed that if Gilead could find a small molecule that interfered with the assembly of the capsid, the company might have a shot at creating an entirely new class of HIV antivirals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-grey-10-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-grey-10-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The curiosity instinct runs deep in Stephen Yant. During his postdoc at Stanford, he became interested in viruses, but until he interviewed at nearby Gilead, he’d never worked on HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of a long day of interviews, Cihlar drew a picture of the HIV capsid on a whiteboard. This, he told Yant, would be his target if he joined the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gilead had a library of around 450,000 chemical compounds that Cihlar wanted Yant to test against the capsid. But to do that, Yant would need to create a novel assay that could be used in a high-throughput screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a formidable assignment. How do you create a test that will efficiently and reliably reveal the effects a vast array of different chemicals might have on a microscopic structure? Yant spent two years reviewing different types of assays. He decided to focus on the speed of assembly of the capsid from its constituent CA protein monomers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The focus initially was on compounds that might &lt;em&gt;inhibit &lt;/em&gt;— or slow down — capsid assembly. But Gilead’s head of structural chemistry, Swami Swaminathan, cleverly suggested they should also search for compounds that might have the opposite effect and &lt;em&gt;accelerate &lt;/em&gt;assembly. Swaminathan’s logic was that if you rush a building project, you’re likely to get a different — probably inferior — outcome. If the capsid assembly was accelerated, perhaps it might be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Yant measured light absorbance — the proxy for tube assembly — at two time-points, early and late in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yant’s high-throughput screen identified a variety of chemical compounds that seemed to impact capsid assembly. Most of them were &lt;em&gt;inhibitors&lt;/em&gt;, retarding assembly. But a few seemed to be &lt;em&gt;accelerators&lt;/em&gt;, speeding up assembly. When Yant tested these inhibitors and accelerators on HIV in a cell culture, both groups interfered with viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team strengthened the evidence that these compounds were acting on the capsid by following the standard approach of studying strains of HIV selected &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;for resistance to several of them. When they sequenced the genomes of the resistant HIV strains, the genetic mutations were all in the region of RNA that encoded the capsid. By showing what the virus needed to change in order to escape the impact of these compounds, they demonstrated the direct connection between their molecules and the capsid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tomas Cihlar was delighted: This was evidence enough to commit further Gilead resources to the project. The antiviral potency of the compounds identified in the high-throughput screen was relatively weak, and most were unstable or had poor PK properties. Cihlar now hoped the medicinal chemists could work their magic, discovering molecules with increased potency and improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-grey-10-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-grey-10-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At an early age, John Link found himself frustrated in biology class. He liked the subject, but whenever teachers would drill down into a biological process and explain what was really happening inside a body, they would stop at the molecular level. Pure chemistry was pure joy to Link, and once he’d mastered the discipline, he found he could read and understand biochemistry texts just fine on his own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a Ph.D. at Harvard, he chose a career in drug discovery. The invitation to join Gilead’s capsid-targeting program as the first chemist answered a deeply personal need. A close family member had died of AIDS just before the advent of HAART. “My cousin was a wonderful, open, really great person. I liked him a lot,” says Link. “My wife and I would visit him in San Francisco and see him with his friends. I really saw a lot of the adversity people had to face — the stigma and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His cousin’s partner also had AIDS, but had survived long enough to get on the HAART regimen, saving his life. The difference in outcomes for the two men hammered home the importance of good HIV drugs for Link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the new antivirals, Link knew his cousin’s partner was in a precarious position. The virus in his lymphocytes had already developed drug resistance. “I was having dinner with him and he said to me, ‘You know, I have one mechanism left in my back pocket.’” Link understood exactly what that meant: If any of the medicines he was currently on stopped working, there was only one type of antiviral standing between him and likely death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Link vowed to give him another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He had no illusions about the task ahead. The capsid was undoubtedly the most difficult HIV target to hit. “I thought to myself, &lt;em&gt;Wow, this is incredibly daunting&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, at that time there was no approved drug that targeted protein–protein interactions.” Going after the capsid meant finding a small molecule that could interfere with the way one capsid protein monomer bound to another. Such protein–protein interactions were only just coming onto the drug hunter’s radar. A small molecule is literally &lt;em&gt;very small&lt;/em&gt;; it would have to somehow come between two massive protein molecules and interfere with their interaction. “You’re talking about bowling balls and a ping-pong ball,” says Link. “How do you &lt;em&gt;do that&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was hard enough to interfere with two protein molecules coming together, but each capsid contains 1,500 capsid protein monomers. It boggled the mind to think how concentrated a drug dose might need to be to hit all those monomers in all those capsids throughout a patient’s body. “We were trying to climb Mount Everest when no one had ever climbed a mountain before. This was the protein-protein interaction target of all protein-protein interaction targets,” says Link excitedly. “I’m sitting there going, &lt;em&gt;Wow, OK, this is super-cool. This is really, really cool&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yant’s molecules had very low potency, so the first task was to increase their antiviral potential. The chemists needed to strengthen the binding between molecule and target by shaping the molecule to fit better in a CA protein binding site and building in interactions such as hydrogen bonds. It’s a slow, incremental process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of the time, the molecule doesn’t do what you want it to do, but you learn something from it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After nearly two years’ work, Link and his team had adapted the molecules to fill the little binding site. But they needed to increase potency still further, which meant trying to get a better grip on the capsid. “What we started doing was making the molecules bigger and just spreading them out onto the surface of the protein,” explains Link. Picture a rock climber reaching for a handhold. There’s a tiny indentation in smooth rock: The climber can get the tips of two fingers inside, but it’s wet and slippery. Beyond that, all they can do is spread their palm flat across the surface of the rock and hope it provides some slight extra grip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not exactly optimal in a life-or-death situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2009, Link had gone about as far as he could go with the inhibitor series. Whatever modifications the chemists made, potency barely rose above a minimal level. “The team was on the verge of throwing in the towel,” says Cihlar. “We were scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cihlar had continued to research the biology of the HIV capsid during the first four years of the program. He was more convinced than ever that it could be a viable target. But it was becoming clear to him that they just didn’t have the right compounds to do it. “There was no Plan B, no other option we could interrogate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Link politely disagrees. He never considered throwing in the towel. He had a real target and twenty scientists determined to crack it. Reluctantly, he acknowledged that the inhibitor series was a dead end, but that just meant it was time to turn to the accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team was running out of time. Gilead had meanwhile launched a single daily tablet that combined three HIV enzyme inhibitors: TDF, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. The capsid program looked increasingly irrelevant and hopeless to some of its leaders. Gilead was on the brink of pulling the plug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, in January 2010, new information helped redirect the team. Gilead had sponsored the Keystone Symposia on HIV Biology and Pathogenesis in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Cihlar went along to represent the company. One of the ways scientists communicate new research at such conferences is on a poster, populated with data, graphs, and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strolling among the posters one evening, Cihlar came across one created by Christopher Aiken, the capsid researcher from Vanderbilt. Aiken was no longer in the hall, but Cihlar was immediately drawn to his poster. It described a small molecule, PF74, discovered at Pfizer. It was a capsid-targeting molecule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pfizer no longer had any commercial interest in PF74. The company had experienced persistent setbacks during its development and had terminated the project. Pfizer’s Antiviral Discovery Group had been disbanded. Several of the researchers who had discovered PF74 had left the company, including the former project leader, Wade Blair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cihlar was doubtful the molecule could make a decent drug: it wasn’t potent enough, and because it looked like a peptide it would be very unstable in the blood. Still, it was a new chemical class. Cihlar scribbled down the molecular structure and, on his return to California, went straight to see John Link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Can you do something with it?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-grey-10-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-grey-10-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wade Blair originally planned to become a physician but got sidetracked by the lure of microbiology. By the time he began his Ph.D. at UC-Irvine, HIV was the absolute focus of every virology program. This new, deadly disease was spreading so fast and killing so many it was already on a par with the historical plagues Blair had studied as an undergraduate. “It really sank in when I went to grad school,” he recalls. “A student in my program contracted HIV and later passed away. That was pretty devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blair was hired into what became the Pfizer Antiviral Discovery Group in La Jolla in 2000. His mission was to search for novel targets for HIV drugs. The group had previously focused on specific HIV enzymes, but Blair took a different approach, instructing his team, “Let’s let the virus tell us what the new targets are.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To do this, they would need to screen over 1 million chemical compounds against the live virus. Any work involving dangerous viruses should take place in a secure lab. To screen a million compounds, sophisticated robotics are needed to load all the plates and measure the results in thousands upon thousands of wells. The La Jolla site had both a secure lab and robotics — just not in the same place. So Blair’s team had to recreate a portion of the robotic screening facility inside the secure lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once they had excluded non-specific inhibitors and known HIV drug families, only one molecule in the entire Pfizer library showed antiviral activity against HIV. The activity was very weak, so Blair and his team began a search for closely related molecules that might have greater potency. The most promising was PF74.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blair set up a series of standard resistance studies, similar to those the Gilead team would later conduct, in which the team gradually exposed wildtype HIV to tiny, increasing doses of PF74 until the virus developed resistance against the molecule. When they sequenced the viral genome, they found — to their great surprise — that the resistance mutation had arisen in the genes that encode the capsid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were pretty excited,’ says Blair. ‘It was completely new.” Unlike Cihlar and Yant, Blair had not been looking for a capsid-targeting molecule, but that was what his whole-virus screen had spat out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blair reached out to Pfizer’s structural biology group, who were able to create a co-crystal structure of PF74 bound to a portion of the HIV capsid monomer. It suggested a new binding site at the interface between two capsid monomers within a hexamer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, by 2005 — a year before Cihlar kicked off the capsid-targeting program at Gilead — Blair had an antiviral molecule that bound directly, if weakly, to the HIV capsid, and he had an idea roughly how and where it bound. Now it was up to Pfizer’s medicinal chemists in Sandwich to refine the structure of PF74 to make it more potent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blair remained in touch with them, but he was effectively off the project. Moved to other HIV and hepatitis C programs in La Jolla, he could only watch from a distance as the Sandwich chemists ran into challenge after challenge trying to turn PF74 into a potent oral antiviral. They were not successful in the timeframe they were given and, eventually, the capsid-targeting program was terminated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It must have been so painful for Blair and his team to see their groundbreaking work canned. Worse was to come: The La Jolla antiviral team was disbanded in 2007. Pfizer would not return to antiviral research until Covid-19 struck more than a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was one silver lining to Pfizer’s exit from the antiviral field: Blair et al. were finally free to tell the world all about PF74.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PF74 was a useful seed to inspire the chemists at Gilead: It was an accelerator from an entirely new chemical series. But John Link and his team knew they would have to create a very different molecule if they wanted to make a viable medicine. The challenges they faced were legion. First and foremost, they had to increase potency so the drug would have a significant antiviral effect at a manageable concentration in the blood. There were toxicology challenges, too. PF74 damaged the CYP enzymes responsible for oxidation in the liver, potentially leading to harmful accumulations of other drugs a patient might be taking. Such drug-drug interactions are problematic at the best of times, and likely to be disastrous in an AIDS patient on multiple drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the biggest problem of all was stability. PF74 was rapidly cleaved in the bloodstream and also swiftly oxidized in the liver. “It was fully metabolized within three minutes in liver cells,” says Link. “This thing was the most metabolically unstable molecule I had ever seen.” Pharmacokineticists measure drug stability in various ways, but one key metric is &lt;em&gt;hepatic extraction —&lt;/em&gt; how much of the drug is eliminated on one pass through the liver. For PF74, it was 100%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Link likens the stability problem to pumping water through a leaky pipe: If you have enough leaks, nothing will come out of the other end. For PF74, there were so many natural mechanisms tearing it apart that it would last barely a few minutes in a human body. None would reach the end of the pipe: the viral target. “Medicinal chemists within the department were saying, ‘We shouldn’t work on this, it’s just not a viable molecule,’” recalls Link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he was determined to try. Spurred on by the memory of his cousin, Link would not rest in his effort to discover a new HIV antiviral mechanism. People were still dying, and the longer it took to find a successful molecule the more lives would be lost. He felt he had to go all in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chemists were guided by new co-crystal structures. At first the images included only one monomer, showing half of the capsid binding site. Later, they were able to obtain co-crystal structures with a full hexamer, revealing the entire binding site at the interface between two monomers. They could see all the binding interactions between the capsid and an accelerator — another scientific first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the capsid project remained on shaky ground and Gilead was considering other alternatives. Late one night at a virology conference in Bulgaria, Link was having a drink with Cihlar:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Tomas, I want to make a pact with you,” he said. “If we get wind of plans to kill the program, we need to walk into the head of research’s office and threaten to quit. It’s the only way to keep the project alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Cihlar shot back, “John, you know all that will accomplish is that we both get fired.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They smiled at each other. Downing their drinks, they agreed to the pact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six long years, Link’s team of chemists labored to solve all the various problems they’d identified. Drug discovery takes a long time, as we know, but it’s almost unheard of for the medicinal chemistry alone to take six years — on top of the years spent previously on the inhibitor series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In all, the chemists designed and handmade more than 3,000 different compounds. At times, it felt like a game of Whac-A-Mole: They would improve potency with one bit of molecular surgery, but that would make the instability worse. They would add a group to the molecule to protect it from oxidation, but that would interfere with binding, causing potency to plummet. It was deeply frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they stuck with it, adding an atom here, a molecular group there, until after six years they had a molecule that was 12,000 times more potent than PF74 and had a hepatic extraction of less than 1%. X-ray crystallography showed it fit in the same binding site as PF74, but the molecule was much larger and vastly more complex. It filled every nook and cranny of the binding site, and with seven hydrogen bonds its grip on the capsid protein was much more powerful. The resulting super-potency meant that even minuscule amounts of the drug in the bloodstream should be enough to stop most HIV replication. The half-life of the molecule in animal models was measured in days, not seconds as for PF74. It was incredibly stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, the team tagged the molecule with a radioactive marker to achieve a finer level of measurement and demonstrate the almost negligible level of hepatic extraction. When injected under the skin of rats, it was found to last for &lt;em&gt;months &lt;/em&gt;without degradation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finished molecule was labeled GS-6207. It is a network of carbon-based rings studded with fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine atoms. To medicinal chemists, it looks enormous, and profoundly odd. Link smiles as he remarks, “I’ve had chemists come up to me and say, ‘You worked on GS-6207. … Where did it &lt;em&gt;come from&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;a&gt;It looks like an alien molecule&lt;/a&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually it would be christened lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-grey-10-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-grey-10-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is unique among current HIV antiretroviral drugs: It blocks multiple, distinct stages of the HIV life cycle. Early in the life cycle, lenacapavir prevents capsids from entering the nucleus, blocking the delivery and integration of HIV genes into the host genome. Late in the life cycle, it interferes with capsid assembly, leading to malformed capsids and so blocking the formation of new virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yant and Link compare HIV drugs to different players on a soccer pitch trying to prevent the other team from scoring a goal: the goalkeeper, fullbacks, centerbacks, and midfielders can all block a goal in different ways. Lenacapavir is able to play multiple roles in blocking HIV replication — it can play goalkeeper, fullback, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;defensive midfielder.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;However, lenacapavir posed a significant practical challenge: It had very low solubility in water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2016, when lenacapavir was discovered, the standard of care in HIV was well established, largely due to Gilead’s own successes with combinations of antiretrovirals: People with HIV are now expected to take one tablet once a day to suppress the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a molecule with low solubility in water can be challenging to deliver as an oral tablet: If it doesn’t dissolve in the stomach, it will not be absorbed through the gut. The chances for absorption seemed poor anyway, given its large molecular size. Medicinal chemists are well versed in the “rules” for orally bioavailable drugs. Lipinski’s rule of five postulates a maximum weight of the molecule, a maximum surface polarity, and a maximum lipophilicity (greasiness), beyond which the odds of achieving an oral drug are low, based on statistics from prior drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir breaks all of these rules: It’s much bigger, more polar, and more greasy than it should be for easy oral absorption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The molecule also breaks a bunch of other rules established to guide drug hunters towards viable small molecule medicines, but Link considers such dogma rather limiting. “If you are trying to solve a problem that’s never been solved, you can’t look backwards,” he says. “We didn’t even think about the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They had to make the molecule abnormally big, he explains, to have any impression on the capsid’s protein-protein interactions (remember the ping-pong ball between two bowling balls), and to defend it — or armor-plate it — against metabolic destruction. Inevitably, that made it less soluble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But every challenge can be turned into an opportunity for innovation with some creative thinking, and that is exactly what Gilead did. Lenacapavir is incredibly potent and stable, so a very small amount of the drug might be able to sit in a human body for months without degrading and still have a massive antiviral effect. &lt;em&gt;What if&lt;/em&gt;, the team asked themselves, &lt;em&gt;we inject it under the skin and just leave it there to dissolve very, very slowly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a huge departure from the original goal of a once-daily tablet. By now, people with HIV had a range of pharmaceutical options to manage their infection, but all of them required daily medication. Wouldn’t it be a whole lot better to get a painless injection and then not have to think about the disease for months?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was a truly exciting idea. A drug that might only need to be administered twice a year would be a major improvement in therapeutic experience for the millions of people living with HIV. But could it be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roshy Pakdaman used to teach physical chemistry as a university professor in France. She loved spending time with students but gave up the academic lifestyle in order to make a greater impact in the pharmaceutical industry. Her more than two decades at Gilead have amply paid out on that life choice, resulting in a string of important formulation innovations. Now she’s in charge, among other things, of formulating molecules like lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pakdaman has a charming, surprising laugh, which she deploys regularly as she describes the difficulties of dissolving lenacapavir in water-based liquids. Formulators sometimes refer to such difficult-to-dissolve molecules as “brick dust.” It was up to Pakdaman and her team to figure out a formulation that could be injected. They had to find a way to make the brick dust more or less liquid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, rather than try to dissolve lenacapavir, they mixed a small amount of undissolved particles in water with some additives. This would yield only a low effective dose, but it would suffice for the first-in-human study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In charge of the clinical trials was Martin Rhee, a physician from South Korea who’d moved to the United States to advance his medical training and had ended up staying for decades. He vividly remembers the first patient he treated with HIV. The man had terrible vertigo: For months, he felt like the room was spinning. No one could work out what was wrong with him. Eventually he was diagnosed with HIV; the vertigo was caused by a related brain lesion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In planning the Phase I trial of lenacapavir in healthy volunteers, the big challenge for Rhee and his team was how to manage the safety risks inherent in a drug that is so stable it might linger in the body for a very long time. “What if they develop some acute reaction?” he said. “With an oral daily drug, you can immediately stop. Here, you can’t stop! You know this drug concentration is going to last for potentially months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Rhee planned a cautious study, administering very low doses to just two healthy volunteers and then waiting a long time to check for adverse reactions before giving the next volunteers a slightly higher dose. Thankfully, lenacapavir seemed to be well tolerated, with only mild reaction at the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even better, the drug seemed to last a very long time in the volunteers’ bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next up was the Phase Ib proof-of-concept study: Lenacapavir was administered to a small number of people with HIV to test its antiviral activity in a human body. The early results were promising. Lenacapavir caused a 100-fold decrease in viral load. Very few HIV drugs ever achieve that level of potency on their own. Moreover, it had a predictable dose-response relationship: The more you administered, the more antiviral effect you got, up to a maximum point. That’s a very desirable trait in any drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pakdaman and her team were working on an alternative formulation that could load more lenacapavir into the small volume of fluid that could be injected under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the clinical data, Cihlar and Rhee could see that their goal was within reach: Physicians might only need to inject an individual &lt;em&gt;once every six months &lt;/em&gt;to protect them against HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because lenacapavir has a completely different mode of action to other HIV antivirals, it was potentially extremely valuable as a therapeutic of last resort for heavily “treatment experienced” people with HIV, where the virus has evolved resistance to most existing drugs. When the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation in May 2019, they encouraged Gilead to focus on this group first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s actually quite hard to locate such people, so a study of hundreds of patients was not possible. Nor was it necessary in the view of the FDA, if the dramatic treatment effect seen in Phase Ib could be achieved again. But the regulators did need to see how lenacapavir performed as part of a combination therapy. Gilead had always known their new drug would not be used as a treatment monotherapy, due to the dangers of resistance emerging. “It’s very risky to use a monotherapy in people who have replicating viruses,” explains Rhee. His Phase II/III study would assess lenacapavir in combination with other HIV antivirals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took a year to enroll 72 participants at 42 sites across 11 countries. Participants remained on their existing (if somewhat ineffective) medication; for 10 days, some of them also received lenacapavir, while the rest were given a placebo. The FDA had set a minimum threshold of a three-fold decline in viral load to demonstrate antiviral activity. When the results were unblinded, 88% of participants on lenacapavir had achieved this while only 17% on placebo made it. Most people receiving lenacapavir had achieved far more than the target three-fold decline.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study continued for another year, although now all participants were given lenacapavir. With that initial proof of efficacy, it would have been unethical to continue to administer a placebo. After six months, there were no serious safety issues, and viral load suppression was significantly better than under the patients’ previous regimens. After a year, 83% of participants receiving lenacapavir in combination with an optimized background regimen had achieved an undetectable viral load.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir was approved for use in adults with multidrug-resistant HIV in the U.K. and the EU in August 2022, and in the United States in December 2022. The next step was testing additional long-acting molecules from different classes of HIV inhibitors to combine with lenacapavir in twice-yearly treatment regimens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-grey-10-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-grey-10-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Moupali Das heard about the stability data coming out of the lenacapavir studies, she was blown away. “I was like, this drug, you can give it every six months, that’s crazy! That’s basically like an &lt;em&gt;HIV vaccine&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das has an almost lifelong commitment to addressing the injustices she sees in HIV health care provision worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although she grew up in the United States, most of Das’ extended family lived in India, and prior to med school, she got a traveling scholarship to study women’s health there. In Kolkata, she worked at an HIV prevention clinic run by a union of sex workers. “That was extremely eye-opening and fascinating,” she says with a smile. “We had to hide from my grandmother that I was going to the red light district.” While working there in the summer of 1996, she read about the advent of HAART therapies for HIV; the sex workers were pessimistic, predicting, “Oh, they’re never going to come to India.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While at med school in New York, Das realized you didn’t need to go to Africa or India to find similar health injustices. She saw significant disparities in HIV treatment in the Bronx and Brooklyn. “There were people in our own backyard who weren’t benefiting at that time from antiretroviral therapy,” she says. “Communities of color, migrant communities, people left out were in despair, and that continues unfortunately to this day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible answer to these health injustices is to offer a form of prophylaxis to such at-risk communities. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) gives HIV drugs to uninfected people to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. Men who have sex with men are doing very well on PrEP. For the first time, the rate of new HIV infection is lower in men who have sex with men than in heterosexuals in many countries. The groups with the highest rates of HIV infection are the marginalized groups sometimes excluded from PrEP for reasons of inadequate health care provision or stigma — migrants, communities of color, and transgender people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das left a highly fulfilling career in public health medicine and joined Gilead partly in order to improve access to HIV drugs for those marginalized groups. That’s why she was so excited to hear about the long-acting potential of lenacapavir. Oral PrEP requires people who are healthy to take a daily medicine, reminding them every day of the stigma associated with their risk of contracting HIV. Possessing a pill bottle linked to HIV may also place a person at risk of social or physical harm from family, friends, or partners. If lenacapavir could protect people from contracting HIV, it would be a very convenient prophylactic, fundamentally different from a daily pill — functionally, a chemical vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could imagine public health programs providing lenacapavir free to at-risk communities all over the world. This could be the drug that finally ends the HIV/AIDS pandemic. “I think it’s really going to help end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere,” says Das. “This really could be a game changer.”&lt;/p&gt;
