The new treatment, also known as Riamet&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Baby in some countries, was developed in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to treat the potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eight African countries also participated in the assessment and are now expected to issue rapid approvals under the Swiss agency’s Marketing Authorization for Global Health Products procedure.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Novartis plans to introduce the infant-friendly treatment on a largely not-for-profit basis to increase access in areas where malaria is endemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“For more than three decades, we have stayed the course in the fight against malaria, working relentlessly to deliver scientific breakthroughs where they are needed most,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “Together with our partners, we are proud to have gone further to develop the first clinically proven malaria treatment for newborns and young babies, ensuring even the smallest and most vulnerable can finally receive the care they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, there has been no approved malaria treatment for infants weighing less than 4.5 kilograms, leaving a treatment gap. They have instead been treated with formulations intended for use in older children, which may increase the risk of overdose and toxicity. Malaria vaccines are also not approved for the youngest babies.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some 30 million babies are born in areas of malaria risk in Africa every year,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with one large survey across West Africa reporting infections ranging between 3.4% and 18.4% in infants younger than 6 months old.&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;However, current data on malaria in young babies is extremely limited as they are rarely included in clinical trials of antimalarial agents.&lt;sup&gt;5,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The available malaria treatments have only been properly tested in children aged at least 6 months because smaller infants are usually excluded from treatment trials,” said Professor Umberto D'Alessandro, Director of the MRC Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That matters because neonates and young infants have immature liver function and metabolize some medicines differently, so the dose for older children may not be appropriate for small babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new dose strength designed for young infants was developed by Novartis with the scientific and financial support of MMV, and as part of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.pamafrica-consortium.org/__;!!N3hqHg43uw!ouNFvS7qyVz8ZE2FOyM5rfk-qFSAxTXGtocGOhfiP5OYazUJcuXqvnKBet7MJ95U97rEgB4cDc5-NztXXQ$" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="PAMAfrica consortium"&gt;PAMAfrica consortium&lt;/a&gt;, which is co-funded by the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.edctp.org/__;!!N3hqHg43uw!ouNFvS7qyVz8ZE2FOyM5rfk-qFSAxTXGtocGOhfiP5OYazUJcuXqvnKBet7MJ95U97rEgB4cDc6H_H-0hA$" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="European &amp;amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership"&gt;European &amp;amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.sida.se/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency"&gt;Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The treatment is dissolvable, including in breast milk, and has a sweet cherry flavor to make it easier to administer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, particularly among children. But with the right resources and focus, it can be eliminated,” said Martin Fitchet, CEO of MMV. “The approval of Coartem Baby provides a necessary medicine with an optimized dose to treat an otherwise neglected group of patients and offers a valuable addition to the antimalarial toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the CALINA study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Swissmedic approval is based on the Phase II/III &lt;a href="https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-and-medicines-malaria-venture-announce-positive-efficacy-and-safety-data-novel-treatment-babies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CALINA"&gt;CALINA&lt;/a&gt; study, which investigated a new ratio and dose of Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) to account for metabolic differences in babies under 5 kilograms. It is indicated for the treatment of infants and neonates weighing between 2 and less than 5 kilograms with acute, uncomplicated infections due to Plasmodium falciparum or mixed infections including P. falciparum. Coartem is known by the brand name Riamet in Switzerland and some other countries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About malaria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. According to the most recent WHO data, there were 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023, almost all of them in Africa. Children under 5 years old accounted for about three in four malaria deaths in the region.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Novartis in malaria innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Novartis finds breakthroughs for diseases neglected by science and brings innovative medicines to communities on the margins of healthcare, building on 85 years of innovation in global health. Novartis has built the industry’s largest pipeline of treatments to control or eliminate malaria and neglected tropical diseases, backed by nearly USD 490 million in funding for global health R&amp;amp;D since 2021. This includes four new antimalarial compounds with the potential to combat rising drug resistance, one of which is just completing Phase III trials, and another which is a potential single-dose cure. Since 1999, Novartis has delivered more than 1.1 billion treatment courses of antimalarials, mostly at no profit, including 500 million treatments of a child-friendly formulation for babies weighing at least 5 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    &lt;p&gt;According to a recent analysis of data from CVDPREVENT, a national audit of GP records to support primary care, women diagnosed with cardiovascular disease are 50 per cent less likely to receive a prescription for lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) such as statins (the most commonly prescribed) than men. Around 200,000 women with cardiovascular disease had a record of high cholesterol, and no recent LLT prescription. According to the NHS, a total cholesterol (TC) level over 6.2 mmol/L is defined as high, while a level of 5 mmol/L or below is considered healthy for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules Payne, chief executive of the cholesterol charity Heart UK, says: “With such discrepancies in access to cholesterol management support, the system is failing women in achieving their target cholesterol levels, even after a CVD&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosis. Real change is needed, from early prevention through to management of cholesterol after menopause or a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/heart-health-risks-menopause/"&gt;gender discrepancy&lt;/a&gt; was illustrated when it was revealed that entering identical heart symptoms for women and men into a NHS virtual GP app called Babylon GP at Hand,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;resulted in starkly different diagnoses. The AI algorithm told a 60-year-old female smoker reporting chest pain and nausea that she was having a panic attack, while a man of the same age reporting the same symptoms was told he may be having a heart attack and advised to go to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the journal&lt;em&gt; Heart &lt;/em&gt;in 2024 showed that women, black people and people from low-income households are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/14/female-heart-attack-victims-half-likely-men-receive-treatment/"&gt;less likely to be offered heart surgery&lt;/a&gt; in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are less likely to have treatments such as stents, heart surgery, medicines such as statins and access to cardiac rehabilitation, which can reduce the risk of a heart attack happening again,” adds Dr Babu-Narayan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do have heart surgery, the results are not as good. Women are more likely to die in the year after heart surgery. According to BHF-funded research, conducted by Leeds University School of Medicine, differences in care for women were estimated to have contributed to at least 8,200 avoidable deaths in England and Wales between 2002 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shernaz, who lives in central London, explains that she had none of the associated risk factors for CVD, she was a non-smoker who hardly drank alcohol, and had never been tested for high cholesterol, so she went to a female physiotherapist when she started getting a pain in her arm.&lt;/p&gt;

But people are increasingly tuning out these public health conversations and resisting being reminded of the pandemic,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/13/brain-memory-pandemic-covid-forgetting/" target="_blank"&gt;almost collective amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGIKHEYBXRGR5P3XXNVP726MQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We paid a heavy price for this knowledge, and literally &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1.1 million people died&lt;/a&gt;” in the United States, Al-Aly said. Now it’s a “question of whether there will be the political will and also the public sentiment to actually utilize this information for public good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6TC66RU2FZGGLLCLCBGYGY3CMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story is the last of a three-part series on five years of long covid.

                The high number of U.S. measles cases this year has been fueled by a Texas outbreak. Three people have died.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has reported 1,288 measles cases this year — the highest number in 33 years, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last time the U.S. saw more measles cases was in 1992, eight years before the disease was declared eliminated in the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a lot more measles transmission than we are used to," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers" target="_blank"&gt;Caitlin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;. She's the director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins University, which has its own &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" target="_blank"&gt;measles dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Measles is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;most infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; known to humans. And more importantly, it's preventable. And so we really hate to see this resurgence of a preventable virus," Rivers says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Texas outbreak fuels case numbers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the start of the year, measles cases have been confirmed by more than three dozen states plus the District of Columbia. The largest outbreak by far&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is in Texas.&lt;/a&gt; The state has reported 753 measles cases this year. Across the U.S., 155 people have been hospitalized, and three people have died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the Texas outbreak has slowed significantly, across the country, Rivers says the U.S. is now seeing more cases on a weekly basis than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak started in January. At one point, Rivers says, the state was reporting 15 to 20 new cases of measles per day, raising fears that, if the outbreak continued the U.S. would lose its "elimination" status, which is a technical term in public health that means the disease has not had a constant transmission for a 12-month period or longer. She says that's less likely to happen now, given that the state is only reporting a handful of cases per week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean it won't happen in the near future, says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City and the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;author of Booster Shots&lt;/a&gt;, a history of the fight against measles.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We are in great danger of losing our measles elimination status, if not this year, then almost certainly in the coming years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner points to kindergarten vaccination rates, which have been falling nationwide for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread. The CDC says a 95% vaccination rate threshold is needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing now is, as vaccine hesitancy has grown, particularly during and after the COVID pandemic, those outbreaks are becoming more frequent and larger," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Lasting impacts&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles milestone comes the same week that some of the&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459978/rfk-jr-vaccine-pediatrics-public-health-lawsuit" target="_blank"&gt; nation's leading medical associations&lt;/a&gt; sued Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., charging him with what they characterize as an effort to undermine trust in vaccines among the American public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, Health and Human Services Department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, "CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He added that the CDC continues to provide vaccines to communities dealing with outbreaks as requested.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And between 400 to 500 children used to die from the disease each year. It can also cause permanent disabilities — the disease is still a leading cause of blindness worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, Rivers says, 1 in 8 cases in the U.S. have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So although many people think of measles as a mild illness and for the most part it is, it can also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5328765/measles-outbreak-health-risk" target="_blank"&gt;cause severe illness,&lt;/a&gt;" Rivers says. "That's an important reminder for parents who are on the fence that this virus is definitely something that's worth preventing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Melanoma, the deadliest form, is expected to rise by 6% in 2025, and the incidence of melanoma in people under 30, especially women, is increasing faster than in any other age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sun exposure is the leading cause of skin cancer, which is why it most commonly occurs on the face, scalp, ears, neck, upper chest and hands. “These are the areas that receive the most cumulative sun exposure over a person’s lifetime,” says Dr. David C. Reid, professor and chair of dermatology at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But skin cancer can also develop in areas that aren’t regularly exposed to the sun, including the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, genitals, buttocks, eyelids, in the skin under the nails, and inside the mouth or nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are often surprised that certain areas of the body that they think are protected from the sun—such as the scalp and the tops of the feet—can still get significant exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, says Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, chief of surgical dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center. But, she says, “while UV radiation is the leading cause of most skin cancers, it’s not the only factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else causes skin cancer, besides the sun?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors, immunosuppression (especially for those who have had organ transplants), and chronic &lt;a href="https://time.com/6269070/inflammation-deadly-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can all raise a person’s risk. So can past injuries; skin cancer can develop in previously injured areas, such as wounds or scars, without sun exposure, Reid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational exposure to certain types of chemicals—such as those encountered by firefighters and industrial workers—can also increase the risk of developing skin cancer, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7287371/what-is-lipoprotein-lpa-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Genetic Cholesterol That Can Impact Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Genetic Cholesterol That Can Impact Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (&lt;a href="https://time.com/7176632/what-does-hpv-diagnosis-mean-sti/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HPV;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;), are a common cause of genital skin cancers on the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. “HPV is a super common virus—and it’s not just sexually transmitted,” says Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and chief medical officer at the skin health company Joya. It can also spread through non-sexual contact with infected skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indoor tanning is a major contributor to skin cancer. Experts &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34885049/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:believe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that the increased popularity of tanning beds and artificial sunlamps is a main reason why melanoma is rising among young people. People who have tanned indoors at any point in their lives have a 29% higher risk of developing basal cell carcinoma and an 83% increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma compared to people who never have, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/#nonmelanoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Skin Cancer Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Skin Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The three main types of skin cancer and where they’re found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, and it’s typically related to chronic sun exposure. That’s why it’s often found on the face (including the nose, lips, and cheeks), ears, and neck, says Dr. Susan Massick, associate clinical professor of dermatology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. While it’s “not particularly aggressive, it can become more problematic if it’s ignored, untreated, or allowed to progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common kind, and it’s typically found on the face, ears, neck, lips and backs of the hands, though it can appear anywhere on the body. “Squamous cell carcinoma favors sun-exposed areas, but can also arise in scars, chronic ulcers, or from viruses, in sun-protected areas,” Reid says. While it’s highly treatable when identified in an early stage, squamous cell carcinoma can spread to surrounding tissues if it’s not addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7284907/ovarian-cyst-diagnosis-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What to Do If You Get Diagnosed with an Ovarian Cyst;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What to Do If You Get Diagnosed with an Ovarian Cyst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma, which is the third most common type of skin cancer, tends to also occur in sun-exposed areas, particularly on the chest, torso, and back in men and the legs in women, Rossi notes. But it can also develop in non-sun-exposed areas such as the mucous membranes in the nose and mouth and the eye, Massick says. It’s the deadliest form of skin cancer because it can spread to other areas of the body if it’s not detected and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent skin cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the connections between skin cancer and sun exposure, it’s important to use a &lt;a href="https://time.com/3924609/sunscreen-spf-uva-uvb/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:broad-spectrum sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; on your skin with an SPF of 30 or higher on a daily basis throughout the year. When spending time outside, reapply sunscreen every two hours, and be sure to apply enough: the amount should fill a shot glass for the whole body, plus two to three fingertips worth on the face and neck, Rossi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When spending long periods of time outdoors, the Skin Cancer Foundation also recommends wearing UPF protective clothing, including wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses that block at least 99% of UVA and UVB light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7281684/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Is Seltzer Water Good or Bad for You?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Is Seltzer Water Good or Bad for You?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use these strategies when you’re driving, too, because UVA penetrates through window glass, Rossi says. You may even want to wear driving gloves to protect the skin on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also helpful to check the daily &lt;a href="https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/uv/search" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UV Index;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UV Index&lt;/a&gt;, which is included in smartphone weather apps,” says Reid. “A score of 3 or higher means it’s time to take precautions” such as seeking shade during the midday hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always steer clear of tanning beds, Suozzi advises, and avoid UV exposure in gel manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to spot potential signs of skin cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to do monthly skin self-exams, making a concerted effort to check out the skin all over your body, including on your back, scalp, and genital areas. (You may want to enlist a partner’s help for these hard-to-see areas—or use mirrors strategically.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: “If you have light-colored hair, red hair, or thinning hair, it doesn’t offer as much photoprotection,” Rossi says. That’s why it’s important to continuously part the hair during skin checks so you can see as much of your scalp as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to examine your nails and the bottoms of your feet, Reid says. A skin cancer subtype called acral lentiginous melanoma tends to appear on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails, “and it is more common in individuals with darker skin tones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7263920/what-are-recurring-dreams/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why Do I Keep Having Recurring Dreams?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Why Do I Keep Having Recurring Dreams?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have heard of the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/at-risk/abcdes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABCDE’s for identifying suspected melanoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ABCDE’s for identifying suspected melanoma&lt;/a&gt; in moles or pigmented spots: A is for asymmetry (meaning one half looks different from the other), B is for border (the spot has an irregular or poorly defined border), C is for color (meaning the spot has color variations, such as shades of tan, brown, black, white, red, or blue), D is for diameter (spots that are larger than the size of a pencil eraser can signal melanoma), and E is for evolving, which means the spot is changing in size, color, or shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning signs are different for other forms of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma may look like a pearly bump, a sore that doesn’t heal, or a pink, scaly patch, Massick says. “Squamous cell carcinoma might also appear as a pink, scaly patch, a wart-like growth or a rough, thickened area of skin that bleeds, scabs, or crusts”—and doesn’t heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop any of these skin signs and they persist for a couple of months, see a dermatologist. “It’s not just moles—any persistent skin change should raise suspicion,” says Suozzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it’s wise to see a dermatologist once a year for a full-body skin check, Rossi says. Your doctor can then do a biopsy of anything unusual and send it to a lab to diagnose or rule out cancer. The key is to catch any abnormal spots early—wherever they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20What%20Most%20People%20Overlook%20About%20Skin%20Cancer&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7300863%2Fwhat-to-know-about-skin-cancer%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE54VFlSS1ZscFlPMlFBYXRpd25UemE1cGFBbjdZcHNTa0xQSHl2Ml9TQmh2TXVtc0RJTUZnbm81RFE5ck5KTzFzNXctOFZjdVhiUDVBeGxRWFdiZDBueVVFLUZfa3dVd1o3WWdRaW5JYW1vcURUY0E</guid></item><item><title>新的研究质疑退出抗抑郁药的严重程度-《纽约时报》 | New Research Questions Severity of Withdrawal From Antidepressants - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSW1wWlhyX2x0TFpxYUhsV1pCRG9Fb0QxaE8xY09oSVNMZGN0ZFNPY0p2X3huYjNkRUM3cUdDWmFIcklPSnQxYTVzRnJFa1FTRnpGNW91aG56cXpKVkJpRlB0eWxMUWF1b284czRfZk5aR1RiVnFDanFpRWFxMEpERHVDdTNtclNQZEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:00:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSW1wWlhyX2x0TFpxYUhsV1pCRG9Fb0QxaE8xY09oSVNMZGN0ZFNPY0p2X3huYjNkRUM3cUdDWmFIcklPSnQxYTVzRnJFa1FTRnpGNW91aG56cXpKVkJpRlB0eWxMUWF1b284czRfZk5aR1RiVnFDanFpRWFxMEpERHVDdTNtclNQZEE</guid></item><item><title>专家指出，简单的运动习惯可以降低患痴呆症的几率- dailymail.co.uk | Experts pinpoint simple exercise habit which can reduce your chances of developing dementia - dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have confirmed that a healthy body really &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;does&lt;/span&gt; equal a healthy mind—and the opposite is true, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study, published in medical journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03798-1#Abs1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, looked at the link between 'youthful' organs and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By measuring certain protein strands in the blood, researchers were able to determine that organs can age at different rates, even when inside the same person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An older biological age of organs was linked to an increased future risk of several diseases and causes of death, including heart failure, progressive lung disease COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-65e43750-5cd5-11f0-b3ed-0daa6aefe725"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, led by Hamilton Oh of Stanford University, also noted that there was a strong correlation between an 'aged' brain and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, having a 'youthful' brain '&lt;span&gt;provided protection' from cognitive decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; you keep your brain—and other organs—young?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggested that a routine of vigorous exercise, a diet rich in poultry and oily fish, and keeping your intellect sharp with further education can all help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research has found a simple crossword can help reduce your risk of developing dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, smoking, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-37ea9990-5cab-11f0-b618-1bdcb6a54d2b"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, eating processed meat, a lack of sleep, and living in a deprived area accelerated organ aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, these lifestyle changes that keep your organs youthful can also help you live longer, found the research by Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, you don't need to sign up to further education to keep your brain young—a simple crossword in the morning can do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885259/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found the five-minute activity slows down memory decline in the early stages of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;found moderate-to-vigorous exercise lowers risk of dementia by 41 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is exercise which gets the heart racing and breathing to the point you can still speak but not sing, like brisk walking, jogging or cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7253703/High-intensity-workouts-better-cardio-staving-dementia.html"&gt;some scientists&lt;/a&gt; suggest high intensity workouts (HITT) could be better than cardio for staving off dementia, because they force more blood to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HITT sees people do short bursts of intense exercise with 80 per cent of their effort, followed by a recovery period to allow their heart rate to drop again. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, they involve quick exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats, kettlebell swings and treadmill sprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it is best to avoid high-intensity workouts before bedtime, as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14883621/How-you-protect-dementia-simple-steps-bombshell-study-stunning-discovery-ROB-GALLOWAY.html"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; found it reduces sleep, which can increase your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other researchers have suggested the ideal age to ramp up exercise to prevent dementia is between the ages of 45 and 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts have warned that pushing yourself too far during exercise can trigger life-threatening brain-bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, a super-fit personal trainer claimed medics blamed her sudden brain bleed on 'years of overdoing it at the gym'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Linzi Todd, from Northampton, suffered a massive brain bleed in March triggered by fluid leaking from her spine, that doctors put down to her history of intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have suggested excessive exercise may trigger brain bleeds, leading to potentially fatal strokes or brain haemorrhages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has proposed lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of dementia—a condition that slowly takes away loved one's memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to scientists cases of the debilitating condition are predicted to rise to 1.4million in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes preventing hearing loss, socialising, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK dementia cases are expected to sky-rocket to 1.4million people by 2040 according to University College London scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic early signs of the devastating illness are memory loss, difficulty concentrating, communication difficulties, and changes of mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However recent studies have found changes in sight, hearing, touch and balance are little-known signs that can strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts called for these sensory changes to be included in diagnostic tests to help people be diagnosed sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical as, while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            At 96 years old, Betty Parker is tired of hearing about other people’s aches and pains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200083b6m44s16akv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, she fills her journal with all the great things she is still doing: picking roses from her garden, reading, playing cards with her regular group and baking pies when she entertains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200093b6m476qcxb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            OK, she admits that maybe she doesn’t quite have the energy to bake pies anymore and should probably buy something from the grocery store next time. Even so, Parker said her 90s have been filled with purpose and connection –– something many people struggle with no matter their age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000a3b6mf7280xhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy behaviors like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html"&gt;nutritious eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/health/strength-exercises-resistance-training-wellness"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; are important to living longer, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/19/health/loneliness-social-isolation-early-death-risk-wellness"&gt;loneliness and social isolation are also key factors&lt;/a&gt; to address to have more years and enjoy them, said California-based gerontologist Dr. Kerry Burnight, who is also Parker’s daughter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000b3b6mqexwzfn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Life expectancy generally has improved in the last generation. But we want to make sure that individuals are living good years, as opposed to just living longer,” said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at UNC’s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000c3b6mvygi2603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A geriatrician is a medical doctor focusing on the care of older adults, while a gerontologist studies aging from the biological perspective as well as the social and psychological, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000d3b6mi1fcoxc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four factors that Burnight sees as being the most important to getting the most joy out of your longer, healthier years: growing, connecting, adapting and giving. And fortunately, just like you can exercise daily to keep your body healthy, she says you can work out your internal strength to improve your connections and sense of purpose.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000e3b6mwuubajk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not too early or too late to start creating a life you enjoy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000f3b6m8aztyxto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you haven’t retired yet, it may be a good idea to start thinking about what your days will look like when you stop working, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000g3b6mty1smgc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The retirement cliff, so to speak, is very difficult for individuals who have been working a lifetime,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000h3b6mc1mawlr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can feel like suddenly you lose everything –– a sense of purpose, how you fill your days and who you connect with –– when you are no longer going into work every day, especially if you have not made a plan, he said. Instead of making such a drastic change, Batsis advises people to start taking up hobbies and activities you’d like to do in retirement while you are still working.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000i3b6mu0bgcose@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have already retired, you can find opportunities to build new things you love, Burnight said. If you have always wanted to publish a book, 80 isn’t too old to start writing. In fact, you may still have a lot of time ahead of you to invest in your passions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000j3b6msrt48x36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late at all. In fact, it’s the perfect time to really lean into and redefine it,” said Burnight, author of the upcoming book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joyspan-Science-Thriving-Lifes-Second/dp/1546007350" target="_blank"&gt;Joyspan&lt;/a&gt;: The Art and Science of Thriving in Life’s Second Half.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000k3b6m70k3e67t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daily crossword puzzles or sudoku are a good way to engage your brain, but to stay cognitively sharp and increase the enjoyment of your older years it is important to do difficult things, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000l3b6miwyha2br@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “New experiences activate neuro plasticity …  that is our brain’s ability to keep growing,” she said. “If you do the same things you’ve always done, you’re really not setting yourself up for continued growth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000m3b6mlpcqatgm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of Batsis’ patients took up golf after he retired, but he also started playing a musical instrument guitar. It wasn’t something he had ever done before, and he didn’t consider himself musically inclined, but the activity opened up a whole new world for him, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000n3b6mq1oqid9p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the patient plays the guitar and also attends local concerts that he might not have otherwise, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000o3b6mldo2q14x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Batsis recommends trying to find a hobby that will keep you physically active. The less you move, the weaker you get, and so he said that finding something that disrupts a sedentary pattern can be helpful in keeping more activities available to you as you get older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000p3b6mcm979skv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The key, however, is to find something you enjoy –– not to push yourself to activities you think you are supposed to do in your older age, Batsis said. If you never liked books, you probably won’t be motivated to become a reader in retirement, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000q3b6m730cy2z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Individuals need to find something that is of interest to them, because the more interesting it is to them, the more they’re going to be willing to kind of engage in that type of activity.” Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000r3b6mvnm4vce6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For caregivers, Burnight cautions against doing for your loved ones anything that they can do for themselves, which varies depending on their skill set or physical limitations. Doing challenging things is important and helpful, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000s3b6mz4be183v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About once a month, Parker meets with a group she calls “the youngs” to play canasta, which she taught them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000t3b6m3qjm314g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The youngs” are a group of women in their 60s whom she met through her daughter-in-law. Although they are much younger than her, Parker said she values having a diverse group of friends. That is especially true as she has outlived her husband and other close connections, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000u3b6miz8ty436@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Like how we diversify our financial portfolio, socially we want to have friends of different ages, friends from your neighborhood, as well as friends from the past,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000v3b6mwr7iwaln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you need connection with more people from your past, Burnight recommends using social media to reach out to people whom you might have lost touch with over the years. People are usually happy to hear from an old friend, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000w3b6m2kl4or3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even small interactions with a neighbor or at your coffee shop can often lead to more meaningful relationships, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000x3b6mth7zgk5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her most important piece of advice is to be the friend, Burnight said. Loneliness is dangerous to longevity, so investing in connection is important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000y3b6mbp79ntop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You need to be the one to call to make a plan or to remember a birthday, or to sit by somebody’s hospital bed or to drive them to their chemo,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Finding joy and purpose
&lt;/h2&gt;

            While Parker has a lot of joy in her 90s, it hasn’t come without a need to adapt, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200103b6mi1aeolw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She had to give up tennis years ago, which she misses, and now she has to use a walker to get around sometimes, she said. But those changes haven’t prevented her from laughing with her family, spending time in her yard or even being in a local parade for the Fourth of July holiday, Parker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200113b6m2xb4w7pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are always going to have changing circumstances, and growing older brings a lot of challenge,” Burnight said. “Instead of just denying that or saying, ‘Oh, my life can’t be great now that I’ve had these things,’ the ones who age well are the ones that adapt, meaning they’re able to accept and even embrace change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200123b6mc8eg6eeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way that you adapt largely is recognizing that it isn’t wrong that you’re going to have tough stuff. It’s how you’re going to respond to that tough stuff,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34498894/" target="_blank"&gt;Research has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that how you think about aging profoundly impacts how you actually age, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200143b6mnjpz36gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who believe that aging is a time of continued growth &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150226/" target="_blank"&gt;live 7.5 years longer&lt;/a&gt; than those who think, ‘Oh, I’m old. I’m going to retire and just go knit with the ladies,’” Burnight said. Unless, of course, you enjoy knitting or want to pick it up as a new hobby.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200153b6mxxeff3qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, she recommends turning your attention to all you have to give. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037156/" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence also suggests&lt;/a&gt; that people who give report higher levels of joy, purpose and longevity, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200163b6m3dr4epo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sounds like a lot to do all at once? Don’t worry. You can start small.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200173b6mv8smocz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it is delivering a lemon from your tree to a friend or offering to watch your neighbors’ young children while they run errands, she said. Even creating art, planting a garden or giving someone who is sick a call is an act of giving that can give you purpose, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Purpose is small and daily and a decision,” she said. “It’s saying, ‘Okay, today, how am I going to use the fact that I’m alive and that I have things to give?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Upstate resident has the measles, the South Carolina Department of Public Health confirmed Wednesday. It is the first case of the disease in the state since September 2024, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected resident is not vaccinated and caught the virus during an international trip, according to a press release. They are currently in isolation at their home and were not contagious while traveling, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have begun a contact investigation notifying people who could have been exposed. Contacts have voluntarily quarantined” to prevent an outbreak, Dr. Brannon Traxler, DPH chief medical officer, said at a Wednesday press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before [the September 2024 case], there were six cases in the fall of 2018,” Traxler said. “Prior to that, the last reported case in South Carolina was in 1997.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1957, before vaccines against measles were widely available, the state had almost 6,000 cases. There have been three deaths from measles in the United States in 2025 so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traxler declined to identify the city or county where the infected individual resides, citing privacy concerns. She said she believes any further spread of the disease can be prevented due to self-quarantines, and no other cases have been confirmed at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious, and a serious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory tract. This virus spreads quickly, which is why we must act now to prevent its spread,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and Health Programs Branch director, is quoted in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is crucial that health care providers and the public be aware of the symptoms associated with this disease,” Dr. Bell added. “It is proven that the best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. I strongly encourage everyone to review their immunization records to make sure they are up to date on all vaccinations and to talk with their health care provider about the benefits and risks of getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public health concern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pamela Bailey, an infectious disease specialist with Prisma Health, told a Wednesday press conference that many in the public health field feel the return of measles is especially concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-c7f2d2d0-7fff-6616-a466-b2d910e2bc54"&gt;Many epidemiologists consider measles the most infectious disease known to mankind,” Bailey said. One infected person can spread the disease to up to 18 others, a much higher rate of spread than with the flu or COVID-19, Bailey said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-c8b25398-7fff-bd23-6c91-ddf061073121"&gt;easles infection can wipe out a patient’s immune memory for everything except measles,” she said, explaining this would leave someone more susceptible to “flus, common colds, diarrheal diseases. Your body just forgets everything else.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;1,267 cases of measles had been confirmed in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; as of July 1, 2025, including cases in Palmetto State neighbors Georgia and North Carolina along with 35 other states. The CDC has confirmed three measles deaths so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been 27 outbreaks [defined by the CDC as a group of three or more related cases] reported in 2025, and 88% of confirmed cases (1,115 of 1,267) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated,” the CDC reports on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in January, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Texas saw a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; with a total of 753 confirmed cases, primarily in the west of the state, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. 98 of those infected were hospitalized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a July 8 update, officials said that less than 10 of the confirmed cases are expected to be actively infectious. Over the course of the outbreak, two school-aged children died. Both were not vaccinated, and neither had underlying conditions. Throughout the recent Texas outbreak, the majority of measles cases were in children 17 and younger, according to the July 8 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of a national trend, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/well/us-measles-record-outbreaks.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;the number of measles cases has hit a record high this century&lt;/a&gt;, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concern for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-19c09b69-7fff-d3fd-6909-ba45922c68e8"&gt;One concerning thing to people in public health is watching the number of children entering school who are not vaccinated for measles in South Carolina,” Bailey said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have dropped below the 95% threshold [needed for herd immunity against spread of the disease] in South Carolina,” she added. “&lt;/span&gt;We are ripe for outbreaks. And there are pockets of communities that, for cultural reasons, have chosen not to vaccinate, and those can lead to big outbreaks” like the one in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="18" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can manifest in a rash lasting five to six days, Traxler said, and can escalate to pneumonia and swelling of the brain. One in five cases may require hospitalization, and one in a thousand infected will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is spread through the air and the virus can remain infectious for up to six hours after the infected person has left the area, Traxler added. Anyone with measles should isolate for at least four days after the rash first appears. Adults with healthy immune systems can receive an MMR vaccine even if they may have previously gotten one of the multi-stage shots or contracted measles, although a completed dose of MMR or a prior history should give lifelong immunity. The vaccine is available at most pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 9, 2025 at 10:31 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

At least 12 states are dealing with active outbreaks, which the CDC defines as three or more cases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,288 confirmed measles cases this year,&lt;/a&gt; the CDC said July 8, the latest information available. The CDC confirmed three deaths from the virus so far this year, said Traxler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is highly contagious, and a serious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory tract. This virus spreads quickly, which is why we must act now to prevent its spread," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist, said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Measles is among the most contagious viruses that scientists study, where each confirmed case can be expected to infect up to 18 additional people. It is a respiratory virus, spread by droplets, and is essentially airborne, experts said. It can persist in a room up to two hours after an infected person has left it, which helps explain why it spreads so easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also points to why it spreads so easily through travel, and many new cases are related to cases or outbreaks from other areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only proven protection is through vaccination, and South Carolina's relatively low rate had health experts worried the virus would eventually show up. The &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/public/vaccinations/sc-immunization-data" target="_blank"&gt;state's vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; varies from 87 percent to 92 percent from region to region — well below the ideal rate of 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;While two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine are required to attend school in the Palmetto State, more and more parents are opting out. That rate is now 2.4 percent, or 20,000 kids statewide in the 2023-24 school year, but is much higher in some districts.

You can often dismiss it as nothing more than &lt;a href="/topic/heartburn"&gt;heartburn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while it is usually a harmless reaction linked to &lt;a href="/topic/digestion"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;, it can sometimes point to underlying health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these is Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition where some of the &lt;a href="/topic/cells"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in your oesophagus grow abnormally, which increases your risk of oesophageal &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, about 1,500 people in &lt;a href="/topic/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/topic/east-midlands"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt; will be offered new “heartburn health checks” to screen for Barrett’s oesophagus. The test involves swallowing a capsule on a string, which dissolves in the stomach to release a small sponge. After a few minutes, &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; staff retrieve the sponge, which collects cells from the oesophagus for lab analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Johnson, NHS national cancer director, said: “For the majority of people with persistent reflux, these quick and easy heartburn health checks will provide peace of mind that you aren’t at increased risk of cancer, and for those who do find out they have Barrett’s oesophagus, regular follow-up checks will be put in place so any further cell changes can be spotted early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is heartburn? And what are some key warning signs to watch for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 lnUWhb eNfKwA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heartburn, also known as reflux, is characterised by a burning discomfort or pain behind the breastbone, which can sometimes extend into the &lt;a href="/topic/throat"&gt;throat&lt;/a&gt;,” explains Dr Matthew Long, consultant gastroenterologist at The Lister Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It usually occurs after eating or when lying down and is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus. Additional &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; may include a sour taste in the mouth, hoarseness, or a chronic cough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What typically causes heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most &lt;a href="/topic/common"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; cause of heartburn is &lt;a href="/topic/acid-reflux"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the lower oesophageal sphincter – the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus – weakens or relaxes inappropriately,” explains Long. “Heartburn may also be associated with a hiatus hernia, where part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm opening that the oesophagus passes through. This condition allows stomach acid to travel upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Common triggers include large or fatty &lt;a href="/topic/meals"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and being overweight. &lt;a href="/topic/stress"&gt;Stress&lt;/a&gt; and certain medications can also contribute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is mild or occasional heartburn managed and treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mild or occasional heartburn can often be managed with simple lifestyle changes, such as eating smaller meals, avoiding late-night eating, reducing alcohol and spicy or fatty food intake, and losing weight if necessary,” says Long. “Over-the-counter treatments like antacids, alginates, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole can also be effective. If symptoms persist, seeking medical &lt;a href="/topic/advice"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; is recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 yqrkU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Heartburn is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32507"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Heartburn is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (istock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do people get confused between heartburn and chest pain symptoms related to heart attacks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, the symptoms can overlap, as both can cause burning or pressure in the chest,” confirms Long. “However, cardiac chest pain often feels heavier, may spread to the arms or jaw, and is more likely to occur during exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there is any doubt, particularly in someone at risk of heart disease, it is important to treat it as a possible heart attack and call 999. Delays in seeking help can be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can frequent or severe heartburn be a sign of a more serious condition?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent heartburn, especially if it occurs on most days for three weeks or more, can sometimes signal a more serious issue,” says Long. “One concern is Barrett’s oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As this condition can increase the risk of oesophageal cancer, it is important not to ignore ongoing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 bJMzeH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Frequent heartburn could be a sign of a more serious condition" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32508"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Frequent heartburn could be a sign of a more serious condition&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What accompanying symptoms could indicate that it might be more serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Red flag symptoms include difficulty swallowing, food sticking in the throat or chest, unexplained weight loss, persistent vomiting, and iron deficiency anaemia,” highlights Long. “If any of these symptoms are present, it is important to see a &lt;a href="/topic/gp"&gt;GP&lt;/a&gt; urgently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should you seek medical advice about your heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should speak to your GP if you have heartburn most days for more than three weeks,” advises Long. “Seek urgent medical attention if you develop chest pain that could be cardiac in nature, especially if it is sudden, severe, or accompanied by sweating, breathlessness, or pain in the arm or jaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Cameron Braddy-Green, consultant gastroenterologist and general physician at Nuffield Health St. Bartholomew’s Hospital agrees and adds: “You should also consult a healthcare professional rather than rely on home remedies if you are aged 55+ with new heartburn symptoms and/or your heartburn does not improve with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatments such as omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 13:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNdjBObDFXNHc4czJzb0cwQWdLc0x0M0Y1bUhVckNlN2liTmg2bFRRcWJMY0VFMzY4UV9ra3dRUUhZa2NSaDltaFBTR2hqblEzV1M2M1NYMXI2STBuX0g0ZmRNTjNvZjlWOGREUnRLeWJVOXZBMkxxYmNlRFhnZnVFVGM2MmdGZktqeG1RemRpZk1hbmhqRFRYZWpvanZJUUxhZ1B0Tmc2RGJnWVVkYUFGdEpuRVNnNlk</guid></item><item><title>正念冥想在30天内提高所有年龄段的注意力-神经科学新闻 | Mindfulness Meditation Boosts Attention Across All Ages in 30 Days - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFAzTjNpXzR2WEZVdFhuXzRmZ0Q3cWhRelEyZjZWRzl3SlVCRVFvZWNTYUllYXRySm1BMUl4d2h2cHFjS2xYdTZCME1uRjkwel9HOE1jcUJVWmFtdWQ0c1NnS3ZKNkdBTXNrb3c3UE5yVmxjVmNKemFZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that just 30 days of daily mindfulness meditation significantly improves attentional control, regardless of age. Using precise eye-tracking methods, researchers found that mindfulness enhanced reaction speed, focus, and resistance to distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive benefits were seen in young, middle-aged, and older adults alike, highlighting mindfulness as a valuable tool for maintaining brain health at any stage of life. The findings suggest even short-term meditation can measurably sharpen how the brain handles attention and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharper Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness improved speed, goal-directed focus, and reduced distractibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Independent Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Young, middle-aged, and older adults all showed similar gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; Eye-tracking revealed changes not reflected in self-reported questionnaires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology reveals that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation can significantly enhance key aspects of attentional control — especially how quickly and accurately people direct their focus — regardless of age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to use eye tracking, a powerful and objective measure of attention, to test the effects of mindfulness training on young, middle-aged, and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that even short-term meditation can lead to measurable cognitive improvements, said USC Leonard Davis School postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed—it can literally change the way your brain handles attention,” Kim said. “And that’s incredibly important for maintaining cognitive health as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Attention Matters in Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people age, they often experience slower reaction times and increased difficulty tuning out distractions. These changes are tied to a brain system called the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline (LC-NA) system, which plays a critical role in attention, arousal, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research, including work led by USC Leonard Davis Professor and study senior author Mara Mather, links age-related decline in this system to early Alzheimer’s disease changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous investigation has also shown that mindfulness meditation can enhance brain areas involved in attention and may increase activity in the LC-NA system. However, this is the first study to examine how mindfulness training affects attention using precise eye-tracking methods and whether the benefits differ across age groups, Kim explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Study: Mindfulness vs. Audiobook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USC study enrolled 69 adults split into three age groups: young (18–30), middle-aged (50–65), and older adults (65–80). Participants were randomly assigned to practice one of two options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness meditation&lt;/strong&gt; using the Headspace app, 10–15 minutes per day for 30 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An audiobook control&lt;/strong&gt;, listening to chapters from a novel for the same duration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed three in-person lab visits and performed two eye-tracking visual search tasks that measured their speed and accuracy in focusing attention and ignoring distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings: Faster Focus, Stronger Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the mindfulness training, participants showed improvements in several core aspects of attention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster reaction times&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were quicker to move their eyes toward target shapes, showing more efficient visual processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved goal-directed focus&lt;/strong&gt;: They made more direct saccades (eye movements) toward relevant targets and were better able to resist being pulled off course by distracting objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced distractibility&lt;/strong&gt;: In some tasks, participants were less likely to fixate on irrelevant but visually “loud” items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the benefits were not limited to one age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected older adults to benefit the most, but we found that mindfulness improved attention similarly across young, middle-aged, and older adults,” Kim said. “This suggests mindfulness can be a useful tool at any stage of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these improvements were not reflected in self-reported mindfulness scores from questionnaires, underscoring the value of objective eye-tracking measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Powerful Tool for Everyday Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mindfulness has been widely embraced for stress relief and emotional wellness, this study provides compelling evidence for its cognitive benefits, too. The improvement was particularly apparent in attention control, a mental ability that is crucial for everything from driving to reading to social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study also compared the effects of the mindfulness intervention to an audiobook control. While both groups showed some improvement in attention, mindfulness participants improved more quickly and more significantly in certain areas, particularly reaction speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that while the study demonstrates promising short-term benefits, future studies should explore whether longer or more intensive mindfulness training could produce even greater effects, especially for older adults facing age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the potential of digital mindfulness interventions to help people support their brain health,” Kim said. “It’s simple, low-cost, and widely accessible.

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published early last year, the findings are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary on the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes. One of the supplements was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;; a dietary fiber in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan"&gt;fructan&lt;/a&gt; class. The other, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-this-blue-chemical-really-boost-your-brain-heres-what-we-know?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Can This Blue Chemical Really Boost Your Brain? Here's What We Know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on mice suggest &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;reduces cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; by regulating gut-brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg" alt="Illustration of bacteria in the gut" class="size-full wp-image-144933" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins.

They are safe and acceptable too," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; geriatrician Claire Steves at KCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twins that participated in the current trial were mostly female, and even though the researchers adjusted for sex differences in their findings, they acknowledge that there may be some selection bias amongst KCL's twin cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Senior couple completing a jigsaw" class="size-full wp-image-144939" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain.

ROACH WRITES: I recently had the occasion outside the hospital to recognize an ongoing stroke in a person who did not immediately recognize the importance of his symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GB7MHNOQU5HANOJTYDINAJLYL4"&gt;Fortunately he did get to the hospital right away, and they treated him rapidly and correctly; his brain function is very good. Had he gone home and taken a nap, which he was considering, it is likely that he would have suffered significant neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I2BYAKAT2BA4DDF42OOJVZ3QYM"&gt;Any dramatic change in a person’s neurological function should prompt the consideration of a stroke. One tool to help people remember the warning signs of a stroke is FAST: face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty. The T is for time; every minute counts, so get the person to definitive care at a hospital as soon as possible. (Doctor’s offices don’t have the tools for diagnosis and treatment. Call 911.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JB2R7MAYNJA7NFG6JU3AN4BCN4"&gt;However, the FAST memory aid doesn’t include some other warning signs such as loss of balance, vision changes, leg weakness, or numbness of the face, arm or leg. Severe headaches out of nowhere (in a person who has never had them before) may also be a warning sign of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRD2XWRPBJF4FENGUT6NZL3YGY"&gt;Many people with these symptoms will not be having a stroke, but any of these symptoms could be signs of a stroke, especially if they come on suddenly (hence the name “stroke”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: My age is 73, and I’ve had a steadily increasing PSA level for many years. In 2020, the result was 11.8 ng/mL, and it has risen to 17-18 ng/mL, where it has stayed for the past year. Since July 2024, I have been taking 10 mg of alfuzosin daily. I had a biopsy in 2017 with no sign of cancer. I had MRIs with/without contrast in 2021 and December 2024; these showed no sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NNY33O36KNDYLKOY432FEVQPKI"&gt;After the last MRI, my urologist wrote: “Your recent MRI showed no suspicious lesions. Only evidence of benign prostate changes is noted. Your prostate volume was 49cc, which gives a predicted PSA level of approximately 6 ng/mL. Your PSA is much higher than this, and the reason is unclear. You should continue to follow your PSA level. At this point, I would not recommend a biopsy of your prostate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5AY2LGUOPBDKBOCBWSWW324PSI"&gt;He then retired with no further comment. I have an appointment with another urologist but have little idea as to what is happening. -- W.D.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QWL26MJYXJDRNISSXTMJZXSR6Y"&gt;ANSWER: It is completely understandable to be concerned about a PSA level of 18 ng/mL, but you and your urologist have, in my opinion, done everything appropriate to look for cancer, which hasn’t been found. It is likely that you do not have prostate cancer as the MRI and biopsy results are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JQA3ML2S3NAOXIETOZTJA2KIYQ"&gt;I do see this in my own patients from time to time; in these cases, men have continued to have a high PSA level, but I have not seen advanced cancer diagnosed, which is something you are probably worried about. I agree with your (now retired) urologist that additional biopsies are unlikely to be helpful given your normal MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6RTWQKAMCZBHXDEUZ3WRW4RMQU"&gt;You might consider a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to reduce your prostate cancer risk. These give a 60% expected reduction in prostate cancer risk. Most men do not have side effects, but some men do, so I’d suggest discussing this with the new urologist.

Haver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-k-SI3iygw"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; she “fell in love” with weighted vests as a way to help her patients with osteoporosis. She &lt;a href="https://thepauselife.com/blogs/the-pause-blog/weighted-vests-for-bone-and-muscle-strength?srsltid=AfmBOoprtG01oOI16vzhpzjGmt0GN9QjcTqfsUonS-DMzkIUmUR2yH0e"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that by walking or working out in a weighted vest, “you can reap a multitude of benefits, ranging from stronger bones, increased muscle mass, and endurance to improve overall strength,” which she notes is crucial for women as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxk78e001h3b775wuwdgt7@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;I’m still &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/what-is-perimenopause-symptoms-explained.html"&gt;years away from menopause&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels like everyone I know is &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/casey-johnston-weight-lifting-liftoff-profile.html"&gt;talking about how weight lifting has improved their life&lt;/a&gt;. After my sister told me she thinks strength training changed her metabolism, I invested in a pair of six-pound dumbbells, which mostly sit untouched in my living room. But I do like to walk, so I was intrigued: Would adding a weighted vest be a shortcut to some of the benefits of lifting?&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxkgh9001s3b770eecx1xd@published" data-word-count="139"&gt;Most weighted vests look similar to a life jacket that you strap on over your clothes, and they’re typically filled with tiny iron pellets to distribute the weight across your upper back and torso. The market is already crowded with options ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZELUS-Weighted-Reflective-Strength-Weightlifting/dp/B081JLDJLB/ref=asc_df_B081JLDJLB?mcid=6d7acffc9b4e37ba830967e23534b3ec&amp;amp;hvocijid=18335661378070239616-B081JLDJLB-&amp;amp;hvexpln=73&amp;amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18335661378070239616&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9004381&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435179778&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Zelus vest&lt;/a&gt; that’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fabuloushaitian/video/7496982217026096430?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751986203244"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to much pricier, heavier, and &lt;a href="https://www.trxtraining.com/products/trx-weight-vest?variant=43372603539596&amp;amp;country=US%C2%A4cy=USD&amp;amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ag%3A22337365570%3A176519267019%3A738542319302&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=pla-293946777986&amp;amp;nb_mi=4622463&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=shopify_US_7955255427212_43372603539596&amp;amp;nb_ppi=293946777986&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22337365570&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-FZK9B6OIDoYxlnJHekH0S-GwyR&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgvnCBhCqARIsADBLZoKM5PDla-ZnP7gOLWAyBpZyt7eVPbIFAV6jp38g9OFpegCLMoF0a84aAgF4EALw_wcB"&gt;more tactical-looking ones&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to go with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088NV9P1F?linkCode=ssc&amp;amp;tag=onamzmarycl08-20&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B088NV9P1F&amp;amp;asc_item-id=amzn1.ideas.1TSCBFDJDM6LX&amp;amp;ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d_asin&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Prodigen vest&lt;/a&gt; that Haver includes in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/drmaryclairehaver/list/1TSCBFDJDM6LX?ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;her Amazon Storefront&lt;/a&gt; (yes, she earns a commission). She recommends starting with a vest that’s around 5 percent of your body weight and eventually working up to 10 percent. My last pregnancy made my back sore enough that I could barely walk, so I decided to start conservatively with 8 pounds. However, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theashleywill/video/7485779628435541279?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751040610575"&gt;plenty of women on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; say they quickly leveled up to 16- and 20-pound vests.&lt;/p&gt;

When I tried it on, it was surprisingly comfortable. There was something invigorating about wearing it. I suddenly wanted to stand up straighter and engage my core, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@flauntshe_/video/7485832370612981038?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751984427181"&gt;the TikTok videos advise&lt;/a&gt;. But it was definitely dorky looking. “You’re going to wear &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; on a walk?” my husband asked, smirking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002l3b77ewmv9h03@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;I generally try to avoid wearing things that call attention to themselves, especially when I’m exercising, so I was dreading wearing my vest out of the house. For my first outing, I was relieved it was drizzling so I could hide the vest under a raincoat while I walked to the grocery store. But it was bulky enough that I still felt ridiculous, especially inside the store, where I had to be extra careful not to accidentally bump into someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002m3b77vrva4a8c@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;I quickly decided the vest was too embarrassing to wear while running errands. It felt weird to wear it with anything besides workout clothes, and the raised sleeves also make it annoying to carry a tote bag. But it didn’t seem to be making my back sore, so I started taking it on longer walks. After an hour of pushing the stroller on a 90-degree day, taking off the vest felt great. But at the same time, walking around with an extra eight pounds wasn’t&lt;em&gt; that&lt;/em&gt; hard. Was it really doing anything? I wondered whether I should buy a heavier one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002n3b77c1s2mfda@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Going for a walk and listening to a podcast is usually one of my favorite activities. But while pages of Amazon reviewers gush about how much they love their vests, I mostly found it tedious. The extra weight made me feel constrained and awkward in a way that reminded me of pregnancy or walking with a baby carrier. It didn’t take long for me to start to resent the vest lying on the floor next to the front door, nagging me to make every trip out of the house a little less enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxlm9b00333b77l13dw456@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;As it turns out, my weighted vest probably wasn’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;doing much. “It’s being marketed as a one-stop fitness solution that is good for bone health and has benefits for muscle, and you can get those benefits from going on a couple of 30-minute walks per week,” says Lauren Colenso-Semple, a muscle physiology researcher at McMaster University. “But the evidence just does not support that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9900393b77nway4j06@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Colenso-Semple points out that most of the studies influencers cite to illustrate the benefits of the vests actually don’t involve walking. For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10995045/"&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; that Haver references when she claims that &lt;a href="https://thepauselife.com/blogs/the-pause-blog/weighted-vests-for-bone-and-muscle-strength?srsltid=AfmBOoprRXqYZKJ_kSqW-gj78Lm7rDHnePS6bYN4cFkRk3m3gDnr2Tki"&gt;weighted vests can help improve bone strength&lt;/a&gt; looked at women who wore vests while jumping. It’s a relevant distinction, since experts say high-impact exercise — like jumping — is beneficial for maintaining bone density (as opposed to walking, which is low impact). “There’s only one study that I’m aware of that looked at walking,” says Colenso-Semple, referring to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;a 2011 paper&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 48 women and found no difference (for bone health or otherwise) between women who walked with a weighted vest and those who walked without one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9a003a3b777j8b6ye3@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhgKemAswE/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;both of these studies are very small&lt;/a&gt; — as are most of the studies cited by influencers pushing weighted vests. “I’m not saying it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;work, but the actual evidence is quite limited,” says Lora Giangregorio, a researcher in bone health and exercise science at the University of Waterloo who thinks walking in a weighted vest is “a waste of time.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm2mt003l3b77l9rmics2@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;While weighted vests were initially pitched as a way for menopausal women to get stronger, it didn’t take long for women on TikTok to start claiming that adding one to their daily walk helped them &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kymberlychase/video/7515579949223316767?q=weighted%20vest%20weight%20loss%20&amp;amp;t=1751298137873"&gt;lose 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. But while wearing a vest might help you burn a few more calories — assuming it’s not so heavy that it slows you down — it does not appear to be a magic weight-loss hack. Colenso-Semple points out that in one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510046/"&gt;commonly cited study&lt;/a&gt;, participants wore a weighted vest for eight hours a day. Even then, people who wore a vest that was 11 percent of their body weight only lost 1.6 kilograms — about 3.5 pounds. Another study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30095153/"&gt;in which participants tried to wear a vest for ten hours&lt;/a&gt; a day, found no additional benefit for weight loss — though some people did report a sore back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm8ka003r3b77vtx55zn8@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;Obviously, walking with a weighted vest can make it more challenging. But Giangregorio says that if your goal is to increase cardiovascular fitness, there are plenty of other, potentially more satisfying ways to do that, like walking on an incline, walking faster, or jogging.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn10a00423b77kmkw6f4h@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;If your goal is to build muscle, there’s no shortcut around strength training, says Colenso-Semple. “You can use dumbbells, you can use machines, you can use barbells — but there has to be some resistance,” she says. Experts say that wearing the vest could be helpful to add resistance while you’re doing squats or lunges. But even then, the amount of weight you could reasonably add with a weighted vest might not be challenging enough, since to build muscle, you need to make the exercise harder over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn5ru00483b77j56m935z@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;“The key is to pick a version of the exercise that’s quite challenging, so you can only do somewhere between six and 12 reps,” says Giangregorio. “That’s a much more efficient way to build muscle than doing an activity you can do for 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxnerm004j3b77na14bbci@published" data-word-count="36"&gt;Definitely not. Personally, I’m thrilled to return to walking around unburdened by extra weight, and I’ll stick to jogging when I want something harder. This experiment did motivate me to do a few more push-ups, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic &lt;strong&gt;insomnia&lt;/strong&gt; is a condition that affects millions around the world, with treatments usually revolving around medications or lifestyle changes. But what if a simple, &lt;strong&gt;natural solution&lt;/strong&gt; could offer better results than the typical remedies? A recent study suggests that the answer might lie in an unexpected place: &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Study Challenges Traditional Sleep Aids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/46/Supplement_1/A179/7181852?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers have found that &lt;strong&gt;sexual activity&lt;/strong&gt; could be more effective than traditional &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt; in improving sleep quality. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/why-do-we-wake-up-every-night-around-3-or-4-am/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71992" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a common issue, with around 13% of the population in &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt; suffering from the condition. &lt;strong&gt;Women&lt;/strong&gt; are particularly affected, with 16.9% of women reporting chronic sleep problems, compared to just 9.1% of men. Despite the availability of &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt;, many individuals still struggle to get the rest they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Kirsch&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sleep specialist&lt;/strong&gt;, and his team sought to explore an alternative method for improving sleep: sex. The team’s findings show that sexual activity, especially when accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;, might trigger &lt;strong&gt;natural processes&lt;/strong&gt; in the body that promote relaxation and a better night’s sleep. This raises the intriguing possibility that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; could be a natural remedy that rivals medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Closer Look at the Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted with &lt;strong&gt;53 adults&lt;/strong&gt;, predominantly between the ages of 25 and 49, with &lt;strong&gt;53%&lt;/strong&gt; of participants being women. Each participant completed a survey that assessed the impact of sex on their sleep quality, and the results were compelling. &lt;strong&gt;Seventy-five percent&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents reported &lt;strong&gt;sleeping better&lt;/strong&gt; after engaging in sex, with many indicating that their sleep improved significantly on nights following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a large portion of participants—around &lt;strong&gt;64%&lt;/strong&gt;—reported that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; was as effective, or even more effective, than traditional sleeping pills. This is a notable finding, as many individuals turn to medication as their first line of defense against &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/why-we-sleep-more-but-feel-more-tired-than-our-prehistoric-ancestors-and-why-were-paying-for-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83669" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, these results suggest that a &lt;strong&gt;natural alternative&lt;/strong&gt; may provide comparable, if not superior, results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Physiological Link Between Orgasm and Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the key to this effect may lie in the &lt;strong&gt;physiological processes&lt;/strong&gt; that occur during &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;. During sexual activity, the body releases a number of &lt;strong&gt;hormones&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;oxytocin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;endorphins&lt;/strong&gt;, which are known to promote feelings of relaxation and well-being. These hormones are often referred to as “&lt;strong&gt;feel-good&lt;/strong&gt;” chemicals and are responsible for the calming effects people feel after sexual activity. The release of these hormones might help to alleviate &lt;strong&gt;stress&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, making it easier for individuals to fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Kirsch and his team caution that the study’s &lt;strong&gt;observational nature&lt;/strong&gt; means that further research is required to definitively understand the link between sex and sleep. They also note that this research did not delve into the &lt;strong&gt;psychological aspects&lt;/strong&gt; of sex, particularly for individuals with negative associations with intimacy. In such cases, the effects on sleep could differ, and the study does not address the potential for trauma or discomfort in certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and the Need for Further Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study are promising, experts stress that more comprehensive research is necessary to fully understand the &lt;strong&gt;mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; at play. The study was observational and based on &lt;strong&gt;self-reported data&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the results could be influenced by individual perceptions and biases. In addition, the sample size was relatively small, with only 53 participants. Future studies will need to include larger and more diverse groups to verify whether these results can be generalized to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study does not explore the impact of &lt;strong&gt;emotional intimacy&lt;/strong&gt; between partners on sleep quality, which could play a significant role. It’s possible that couples who are emotionally close might experience different sleep benefits from sex compared to those who are not. Additionally, the study did not consider the &lt;strong&gt;long-term effects&lt;/strong&gt; of using sex as a sleep aid, which would be an important avenue for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

Her journey began in 1950 when she started working at Macy’s Department Store in New York City. Her charisma and ability to connect with people eventually led her to Bloomingdale’s, where she was hired to interview patrons during breakfast events; a unique role that catapulted her into the media spotlight. Her warm interactions and natural curiosity became the foundation for “The Sally Froelich Show,” a talk show that aired for over 20 years, engaging audiences with candid conversations and relatable topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The guests would talk to me, and the audience would ask questions. It was a lot of fun,” as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TV host Froelich joins ‘&lt;keyword id="27710578" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="SuperAgers-study" source="keywords"&gt;SuperAgers study&lt;/keyword&gt;’ to explore the science behind &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many topics she explored on her show, one series remains especially close to Froelich’s heart: “The Vital Years.” Launched when she was around 60 years old, the series focused on the challenges and joys of aging in later adulthood — including second marriages, staying active, health concerns, and grandparenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, these conversations feel more relevant than ever, as Froelich participates in an innovative research project aiming to unlock the secrets of healthy aging. Froelich is one of 600 participants in the SuperAgers Family Study, run by the American Federation for Aging Research. This study is no small effort — it seeks to enroll 10,000 individuals aged 95 and older who are in good physical and cognitive health. But it’s not just about the SuperAgers themselves. The study also includes their adult children and the spouses of those children who don’t have SuperAger parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;95 year old woman shares 9 secrets to a long, healthy life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she may have longevity genes on her side, Froelich also practices many of the healthy lifestyle habits recommended by experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat three meals a day. I don’t overeat,” she says. A balanced diet helps maintain energy, weight, and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She never smoked and drinks only in moderation. Research shows smokers are three times more likely to die prematurely of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich proudly notes that her weight hasn’t changed in 50 years, even though her body shape has. This stability helps reduce strain on joints and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lifelong sports enthusiast, she continues to golf 2–3 times a week and exercises six days a week — including stretching, sit-ups, and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich keeps her mind sharp with bridge, audiobooks, and TV. Mental stimulation supports cognitive health and memory as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dines out weekly, sees her children regularly, and checks in with her grandchildren via Zoom. Social interaction is linked to lower rates of depression and dementia. “If I’ve been hanging around the house a lot, I just go out and walk around the block,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice? “Do what you want to do and things that make you happy. Eat ice cream and delicious chocolate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep your hair done, your nails done… and have someone tell you if anything looks off,” she says.

To discover which genes are responsible for helping people live long, healthy, and disease-free lives. Past research suggests that certain genes may play a key role in exceptional longevity — including those that influence HDL cholesterol and growth hormone regulation. Dr. Milman and her team have found that genetics often outweigh lifestyle factors when it comes to reaching the age of 95 and beyond. “We found that [SuperAgers] didn’t differ in smoking, alcohol use, diet, or exercise compared to their peers — and yet, they lived significantly longer,” Milman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How healthy habits can delay age-related diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery, lifestyle choices remain critically important. While only 0.1% of Americans live to age 95 or older, the rest of the population can still dramatically reduce the risk of age-related diseases by adopting healthy habits. “It’s unlikely that a healthy lifestyle alone will get you to 95,” said Milman, “but it can delay the onset of illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Rosanne Leipzig, geriatrician and author of Honest Aging, genetics account for about 20–40% of longevity, while the remaining 60–80% is shaped by your environment and life experiences — including your childhood nutrition, education, access to healthcare, and even the neighborhood you grew up in. She also highlights the concept of “weathering” — the idea that chronic stress from systemic disadvantage, particularly among African American women, can impact long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/waking-up-with-a-headache-it-could-be-a-silent-sign-of-high-bp-experts-warn/articleshow/122337397.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Waking up with a headache?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deceased: &lt;/strong&gt;A 39-year-old woman in Belgrade, Serbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman's ex-husband found the woman's body in her apartment and notified the police. She was lying on her left side on the living room couch, and her body was covered by a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;Police removed the blanket to examine the body; the woman was naked from the waist down. There were no visible signs of violence or injury. The police then discovered an object protruding from the woman's bottom: a spring twirl whisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its wooden handle had been inserted into her anus to a depth of about 4 inches (10 centimeters), penetrating her anus and rectum as "a dildo-like object," doctors wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to the ex-husband, the woman had high blood pressure, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;arterial hypertension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for which she was taking medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The autopsy findings: &lt;/strong&gt;An examination of the woman's cranium revealed a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subarachnoid hemorrhage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — bleeding in the space between the brain and a layer of tissue surrounding it. Blood had pooled to a depth of up to 0.2 inches (6 millimeters) around the base of the brain and the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When medical examiners cleared out the blood clots, they discovered a ruptured saccular aneurysm, a blood-filled sphere that ballooned from a blood vessel in the brain. This is also known as a "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;berry aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" for its resemblance to a round berry dangling from a stem, and it is the most common type of aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aneurysm measured 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) in diameter and had popped at the top of its dome. When aneurysms rupture, they release blood that can kill nearby brain cells and increase pressure inside the skull. As pressure builds, the flow of oxygen and blood to the brain may be disrupted, which can lead to unconsciousness and death. Aneurysms are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more common in women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than in men, especially in women with low estrogen levels, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In the woman's case, her partial nudity, body posture and the presence of the whisk suggested that she was using the kitchen tool for anal self-stimulation, the report's authors wrote. Her sexual excitement and subsequent orgasm could have temporarily caused her blood pressure to spike enough to rupture the aneurysm, causing a fatal hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Sexual activity is not a common cause of sudden death. In prior studies that evaluated a total of nearly 130,000 forensic autopsies, 195 of the deaths (0.15%) were linked to sex, and only a fraction of the deceased were women. When someone dies during or shortly after intercourse, it is usually an older male with a much younger female partner, and the cause of death is typically abrupt cardiac failure, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, sudden death during sex is often caused by a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;burst saccular aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is the first case to present such a scenario for a woman's death during anal self-stimulation, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            The approval of the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/africa/malaria-us-foreign-aid-cuts-africa-intl"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; treatment for newborns and young infants could lead to imminent widespread use in Africa, drugmaker Novartis said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0006356n71qn2g5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The drug, known as Coartem Baby or Riamet Baby in some countries, has been approved by Swiss authorities for use in babies weighing between 2 kilograms (4 pounds, 6 ounces) and 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and is formulated to be easy for them to take, Novartis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcup7o7u00013b6m90xet236@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coartem Baby already has approval in the West African nation of Ghana and Novartis said it now expects eight African countries to grant their own approvals within 90 days. The countries – Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda – also participated in the assessment of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000e356n5r29uew4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said in a news release that this first clinically proven malaria treatment for newborns and young babies ensures “even the smallest and most vulnerable can finally receive the care they deserve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0004356ntvh8zo19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until now, the smallest babies have been treated for malaria, a potentially deadly disease spread by mosquitoes, with medications designed for older children. Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical corporation behind the newly approved drug, says this can expose newborns to the risk of overdose and toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0005356n3mnljtaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most clinical trials have historically excluded babies under six months old,” Novartis spokesman Ruairidh Villar told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000b356n0q9f7x43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023 – nearly all of them in Africa, according to World Health Organization data. Children under the age of 5 accounted for about three in four malaria deaths in the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0008356nrlnit4tn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medicine was developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), a Switzerland-based not-for-profit organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0009356n0zdsky63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Novartis told CNN that it plans to “roll out the medicine in the coming weeks on a largely not-for-profit basis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000c356nvv8zem83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, particularly among children. But with the right resources and focus, it can be eliminated,” said Martin Fitchet, chief executive of MMV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000d356n8qoxp5i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The approval of Coartem Baby provides a necessary medicine with an optimized dose to treat an otherwise neglected group of patients and offers a valuable addition to the antimalarial toolbox.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The state was plagued by epidemics of dengue and yellow fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;A pile of black salt marsh mosquitoes lie on a sorting table at Pinellas County Mosquito Control.

While operations are similar, they aren’t identical. For example, Pinellas and Hillsborough’s mosquito control are run within the county, while Pasco’s is an independent &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pasco/2024/12/31/pasco-county-mosquito-control-abandons-plans-new-campus/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pasco/2024/12/31/pasco-county-mosquito-control-abandons-plans-new-campus/"&gt;special district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;financed by its own property tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It means mosquito control methods and budgets can vary widely across a state where about 90 mosquito species live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;Not all mosquitoes bite us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In Pinellas, workers return daily with the traps and spread the dead insects on a piece of paper. With tweezers, they parse through what resembles a mound of fake eyelashes, counting and documenting the mosquitoes by hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Only some mosquitoes carry diseases. In Pinellas County, there are 40 species of mosquitoes but just 17 that officials say pose a serious concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Mary Bolton, an entomology assistant trainee, examines a pile of black salt marsh mosquitoes.

CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito control can calculate how many mosquitoes land on a person in a minute. When it reaches&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;around&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;10, then&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;there’s likely a problem,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;said Alissa Berro, director of Pinellas County Vegetation Management and Mosquito Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Some staff are so accustomed to bites that they’ve developed an immunity to mosquito saliva, which can cause itchy, splotchy marks, said Caroline Scott, a senior environmental specialist for Pinellas County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But not all mosquitoes bite people. Some take their “blood meals” (the unfortunate way researchers describe how&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mosquitoes feed) from birds, reptiles or even leeches, Berro said. The bloodsuckers&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are all female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Trapping and identification is crucial for mosquito control to measure populations and plan how to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;What to know about mosquito-borne illnesses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The mosquitoes that officials typically look out for are the ones that carry diseases, like malaria, dengue or West Nile, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Thanks to mosquito control and air-conditioned homes, these diseases have become uncommon in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;A group of Red Star hens mill around in a holding coop at Pinellas County Mosquito Control in Clearwater.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;However,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;one virus has caught the attention of Kristi Miley, a researcher at the University of South Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dengue cases have more than tripled in the state over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;From about 2010 to 2018, there were about 800 cases&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in which someone was bitten elsewhere but found to be sick in Florida, and about 100 in which someone was bitten in the state. From 2019 to 2024, travel-related cases increased to more than 3,000, and locally acquired cases jumped to more than 400. That&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;rise could be higher considering that last year’s data may not be complete, Miley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“This is starting to be concerning,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Pasco County saw 11 cases of travel-related dengue and 13 cases of locally acquired dengue in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Dengue is no longer a travel-related issue,” said Adriane Rogers, executive director of Pasco County Mosquito Control District, in an email to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dengue has four different strains. If a person is infected with one strain, they may experience flu-like symptoms. If they are infected with a different strain later on, their immunity for the virus is lower and, in rare cases, they can die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“The rise in local cases means we all have a role to play — from public health officials and clinicians to everyday residents,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Rogers said, adding that mosquito-borne diseases often go unreported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Miley and her team are creating a model that predicts the risk of dengue in Florida based on weather factors and land use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“At the end of the day, you have this risk model that potentially could be offered to mosquito control as a way to be more proactive,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Jars at Pinellas County Mosquito Control in Clearwater contain mosquitoes trapped from different parts of the county.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It’s difficult because there is no uniform reporting of mosquito populations across the state. Miley relies on mosquito programs to offer their data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito control officials in Florida meet annually to discuss trends and methodologies, and they often collaborate when an outbreak is occurring across county lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But mosquito control programs are ultimately silos, Miley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;How mosquito control districts treat mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In Tampa Bay, there’s typically a layered approach to attacking mosquitoes. The easiest and most effective way is getting to them before they can fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When they’re flying, “they’re hard to trap, and they’re also biting people and possibly spreading disease,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquitoes need water to breed. Without it, they can’t thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Most mosquito control programs breed mosquito-eating fish and give them out to the public for free. The fish, aptly named mosquitofish, have spoon-shaped mouths that can suck up the larvae wriggling on the water’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Mosquito larvae swim in an observation dish under a microscope. The larvae are observed to identify the species, their stage of development and the efficacy of larvicides. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito officials also use larvicides and insecticides to target the insects. They often rear the bugs in-house to test their resistance levels, sometimes at state labs.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito control officials in Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco also respond to public requests to fight mosquito populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There are certain criteria, like a high number of mosquitoes found in an area, before mosquito officials can spray a larger area than a requested home or business, Berro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Officials use people, vans or even helicopters to treat areas where mosquitoes have become an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Mary Bolton prepares chunks of dry ice for mosquito traps. The dry ice attracts mosquitoes, which are drawn to the carbon dioxide in human and animal breath.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;Florida’s weather is a mosquito’s paradise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Florida’s warm weather means mosquitoes can survive through the seasons. Heat combined with rainfall can influence a mosquito’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In the summer, mosquitoes can go from egg to adult in three to five days. In the winter, it could take a week or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The average lifespan of an adult mosquito can be anywhere from two weeks to two months, Scott said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And climate change is extending warmer weather seasons, allowing mosquito populations to thrive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Hurricanes can also prolong&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mosquitoes’ active time, dumping more rain and leading to more standing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“We’ve seen&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a vast increase in these extreme weather patterns, and the last couple of hurricane seasons have left a lot of debris,” Miley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Storm debris can sit out for weeks, providing a perfect breeding ground. That’s why experts say it’s so important to drain standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Eradicating mosquitoes is not the goal, Rogers said. Some populations are pollinators or food sources for other animals. Instead, mosquito control seeks to keep dangerous populations at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s a delicate balance,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The effort to hold back mosquito populations in Florida is massive. There is no silver bullet, Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Instead, there are myriad methods, from complex science and expensive equipment to the sentinel chickens — still oblivious to their role in the persistent battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="article__body-align article__body-align-center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;• • •&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Gabrielle Calise contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body-float article__body-float-left"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tampa Bay Times launched the Environment Hub in 2025 to focus on some of Florida‘s most urgent and enduring challenges.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Princeton University and the Simons Foundation have identified four clinically and biologically distinct subtypes of autism, marking a transformative step in understanding the condition's genetic underpinnings and potential for personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing data from over 5,000 children in &lt;a href="https://sparkforautism.org/portal/page/about-spark" target="_blank"&gt;SPARK&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; cohort study, the researchers used a computational model to group individuals based on their combinations of traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used a "person-centered" approach that considered a broad range of over 230 traits in each individual, from social interactions to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/repetitive+behaviors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; to developmental milestones, rather than searching for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+links/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic links&lt;/a&gt; to single traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach enabled the discovery of clinically relevant autism subtypes, which the researchers linked to distinct genetic profiles and developmental trajectories, offering new insights into the biology underlying autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the genetics of autism is essential for revealing the biological mechanisms that contribute to the condition, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and guiding personalized care," said senior study author Olga Troyanskaya, director of Princeton Precision Health, the Maduraperuma/Khot Professor of Computer Science and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton, and deputy director for genomics at the Center for Computational Biology of the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study defines four subtypes of autism—Social and Behavioral Challenges, Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay, Moderate Challenges, and Broadly Affected. Each subtype exhibits distinct developmental, medical, behavioral and psychiatric traits, and importantly, different patterns of genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals in the Social and Behavioral Challenges group show core autism traits, including social challenges and repetitive behaviors, but generally reach developmental milestones at a pace similar to children without autism. They also often experience co-occurring conditions like ADHD, anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder alongside autism. One of the larger groups, this constitutes around 37% of the participants in the study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group tends to reach developmental milestones, such as walking and talking, later than children without autism, but usually does not show signs of anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviors. "Mixed" refers to differences within this group with respect to repetitive behaviors and social challenges. This group represents approximately 19% of the participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with Moderate Challenges show core autism-related behaviors, but less strongly than those in the other groups, and usually reach &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/developmental+milestones/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt; on a similar track to those without autism. They generally do not experience co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Roughly 34% of participants fall into this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Broadly Affected group faces more extreme and wide-ranging challenges, including developmental delays, social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and co-occurring psychiatric conditions like anxiety, depression and mood dysregulation. This is the smallest group, accounting for around 10% of the participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically, we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology," said Aviya Litman, a Ph.D. student at Princeton and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Distinct genetics behind the subtypes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, autism researchers and clinicians have been seeking robust definitions of autism subtypes to aid in diagnosis and care. Autism is known to be highly heritable, with many implicated genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+testing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt; is already part of the standard of care for people diagnosed with autism, thus far, this testing reveals variants that explain the autism of only about 20% of patients," said study co-author Jennifer Foss-Feig, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+psychologist/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical psychologist&lt;/a&gt; at the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and vice president and senior scientific officer at the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study takes an approach that differs from classic gene discovery efforts by identifying robust autism subtypes that are linked to distinct types of genetic mutations and affected biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, children in the Broadly Affected group showed the highest proportion of damaging de novo mutations—those not inherited from either parent—while only the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group was more likely to carry rare inherited genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While children in both of these subtypes share some important traits like developmental delays and intellectual disability, these genetic differences suggest distinct mechanisms behind superficially similar clinical presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings point to specific hypotheses linking various pathways to different presentations of autism," said Litman, referring to differences in biology between children with different autism subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the researchers identified divergent biological processes affected in each subtype. "What we're seeing is not just one biological story of autism, but multiple distinct narratives," said Natalie Sauerwald, associate research scientist at the Flatiron Institute and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This helps explain why past genetic studies often fell short—it was like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle without realizing we were actually looking at multiple different puzzles mixed together. We couldn't see the full picture, the genetic patterns, until we first separated individuals into subtypes."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Autism biology unfolds on different timelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that autism subtypes differ in the timing of genetic disruptions' effects on brain development. Genes switch on and off at specific times, guiding different stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the genetic impact of autism was thought to occur before birth, in the Social and Behavioral Challenges subtype—which typically has substantial social and psychiatric challenges, no developmental delays, and a later diagnosis—mutations were found in genes that become active later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that, for these children, the biological mechanisms of autism may emerge after birth, aligning with their later clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By integrating genetic and clinical data at scale, we can now begin to map the trajectory of autism from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to clinical presentation," said co-author Chandra Theesfeld, senior academic research manager at the Lewis-Sigler Institute and Princeton Precision Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A paradigm shift for autism research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study builds on more than a decade of autism genomics research &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-artificial-intelligence-class-mutations-autism.html"&gt;led by Troyanskaya and collaborators&lt;/a&gt;. It is enabled by the close integration of interdisciplinary expertise in genomics, clinical psychology, molecular biology, computer science and modeling, and computational biology—with experts from Princeton Precision Health, the Flatiron Institute and SFARI.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"It's a whole new paradigm, to provide these groups as a starting point for investigating the genetics of autism," said Theesfeld. Instead of searching for a biological explanation that encompasses all individuals with autism, researchers can now investigate the distinct genetic and biological processes driving each subtype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift could reshape both autism research and clinical care—helping clinicians anticipate different trajectories in diagnosis, development and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ability to define biologically meaningful autism subtypes is foundational to realizing the vision of precision medicine for neurodevelopmental conditions," said Sauerwald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the current work defines four subtypes, "this doesn't mean there are only four classes," said Litman. "It means we now have a data-driven framework that shows there are at least four—and that they are meaningful in both the clinic and the genome."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For families navigating autism, knowing which subtype of autism their child has can offer new clarity, tailored care, support and community. "Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment, and tailored support and accommodations at school or work," said Foss-Feig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could tell families, when their children with autism are still young, something more about what symptoms they might—or might not—experience, what to look out for over the course of a lifespan, which treatments to pursue, and how to plan for their future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its contributions to understanding autism subtypes and their underlying biology, the study offers a powerful framework for characterizing other complex, heterogeneous conditions and finding clinically relevant disease subtypes. As Theesfeld put it: "This opens the door to countless new scientific and clinical discoveries."&lt;/p&gt;

                Phillipa Munari suffered nerve pain and exhaustion after she stopped taking antidepressants. She struggled to train her horse, Bella, and "could barely walk because of the withdrawal," said Munari. "I spent 20 hours in bed most days for two years."

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Phillipa Munari started antidepressants in 2003. Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn't think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, this went fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible," she said. "I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof." These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she'd been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I had complete panic. I couldn't leave the house," she said. Driving in the car, she said, "I'd be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed." It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen, and didn't believe them when they said they were having a problem.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12602_discontinuation-symptoms-treatment-serotonin-reuptake.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suffering from symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What most prescribers and patients don't understand is that "you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them," said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari's for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand," Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Before I took it, I had feelings'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After spending 13 years on antidepressants, Sven Huber, from western Germany, had lasting problems after stopping the drugs.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player's suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, "fit on me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. "It felt like a switch was flipped," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber's doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as "brain zaps." He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he'd never had before. All of these are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259826/" target="_blank"&gt;documented symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can't relate to any family members or friends," he said. "Before I took it, I had feelings – bad feelings often – but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. "I would just like to feel like a human," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Side effects that may never go away&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber's probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University's School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say it's an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble," said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While patients and researchers often refer to lasting symptoms as "protracted withdrawal," Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like "serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction" or "antidepressant withdrawal injury" as umbrella terms for the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it's important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and "shouldn't be given routinely for years and decades. I think that's where we're running into problems." For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'That's historic'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber was relieved to learn he wasn't alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having "genital anesthesia" and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reading these, "I knew I wasn't crazy," Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A forum called &lt;a href="http://survivingantidepressants.org" target="_blank"&gt;Surviving Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs' negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions' prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's historic," Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about this kind of institutional involvement. "That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another organization, the &lt;a href="https://antidepressantinfo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Antidepressant Coalition for Education&lt;/a&gt;, is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After experiencing seven years of withdrawal symptoms from Paxil, Adele Framer started an online community forum in 2011.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'People don't learn this stuff in medical school'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maudsley-Guidelines-prescribing-Prescribing/dp/111982298X" target="_blank"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one's dose gradually – by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example – differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;establish the duration&lt;/a&gt; and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don't know how to gradually reduce the dosage," she said, and "people don't learn this stuff in medical school."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council's goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms, and warned "we would not want people not to take the medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA's research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA's interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. "When you do a review, you're only reviewing what exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren't designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he'd like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users' experiences after they stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424670/rfk-jr-samhsa-mental-health-addiction-overdose-trump-budget-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;staffing at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he believes the APA's literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard. "It means that pressure has got somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apmreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt; APM Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the investigative reporting unit at American Public Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An increased risk of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers is associated with obesity, which is also rising in the U.S. That’s what scientists say is a “leading theory” for the surge - noting a 2019 study that found women who were considered obese had nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Close to half of all U.S. adults are predicted to be obese by 2030, according to &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/half-of-us-to-have-obesity-by-2030/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research released the same year.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research released the same year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The chronic condition can cause inflammation and higher levels of insulin that increases peoples’ risk of getting cancer, including several types of gastrointestinal cancers, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/obesity.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Other risk factors include smoking, drinking alcohol, eating a Western-style diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Earlier this year, new research pointed to the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/gut-toxins-50-000-deaths-190451330.html" data-ylk="slk:a toxin in the gut, known as colibactin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a toxin in the gut, known as colibactin&lt;/a&gt;, that can inflict DNA damage on colon cells that leads to the development of cancer.

For women in the same age group, it’s the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Colorectal cancer, the most common type of gastrointestinal cancer, also affects Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and Asian people disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Changing treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These and other related findings signal a worrying shift — and potentially a need for updated treatment practices, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients with early-onset colorectal cancers often experience delays in diagnosis because neither doctors, nor their patients, suspect cancer and doctors are more likely to diagnose patients when they are at advanced stages of the disease.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you’re watching your blood sugar, it’s easy to assume pasta is off the menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, some types of pasta are rich in blood sugar–leveling protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We asked dietitians the best pasta for healthy blood sugar. They unanimously said chickpea pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A warm, saucy bowl of pasta can instantly transport your taste buds to a place of bliss. But if you’re watching your blood sugar, you may have heard that pasta shouldn’t be a nightly event. So, we asked four registered dietitians to share the best pasta for blood sugar management, and they all said the exact same thing: chickpea pasta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chickpea pasta is an excellent selection because it’s made from legumes, [which provide] a combination of carbohydrates, protein and fiber,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “This combination helps slow down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, resulting in a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels compared to a rapid increase.” Skeptical about its taste? Even die-hard purists may not notice the swap. Chickpea pasta looks, cooks and tastes surprisingly like traditional pasta. But it has multiple nutritional advantages and blood sugar benefits. Read on, as we dig into why chickpea pasta gets the thumbs-up for better blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-chickpea-pasta-is-our-1-pick-for-better-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Chickpea Pasta Is Our #1 Pick for Better Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it's spaghetti, penne or farfalle, traditional pasta is typically made of durum wheat flour. Because it’s refined, it contains quickly digested carbohydrates that are low in fiber. This can cause your blood sugar to spike, especially if pasta is the only thing in your bowl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpea pasta, on the other hand, is made from chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans). Yes, it contains carbs. However, it also provides blood sugar–stabilizing fiber and protein. “Chickpea pasta delivers significantly more fiber than traditional refined wheat pasta, and this fiber helps slow digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.healthbysapna.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ashleyhawkrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashley Hawk, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, is also a fan of adding fiber to your pasta bowl. “I like to think of fiber as the traffic controller for your digestion. It helps slow down how quickly food breaks down and sugar hits your bloodstream,” she explains. And chickpea pasta is filled with it. Two ounces of dry, uncooked chickpea pasta provides an impressive 8 grams of fiber. That’s roughly 30% of your daily requirement in one small serving and more than four times the amount in a similar-size serving of traditional pasta.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpea pasta also contains good-for-you plant-based protein. “Even though you’re still getting a good amount of carbohydrates from chickpea pasta, the protein content in it can help stabilize blood sugar levels by slowing glucose absorption,” says Peruvemba. A standard 2-ounce serving of uncooked chickpea pasta packs about 11 grams of protein. That’s nearly 60% more than the 7 grams you’d get from regular pasta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to chickpea pasta’s hefty protein content, there’s no need to add chicken, fish or shrimp to your dish to up its protein. Chickpea pasta’s plant protein may be especially advantageous when you’re watching your blood sugar. Research shows that consuming more animal protein may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Conversely, swapping in plant-based protein like the kind in chickpea pasta has been found to improve insulin sensitivity, help with weight management and lower overall diabetes risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Healthy Gut Bacteria  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out what you feed your gut impacts far more than just your digestive health. It can influence your entire body, including your blood sugar. “The fiber found in chickpea pasta can act as a prebiotic in the body, which helps feed the good bacteria in the gut,” explains &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha MacLeod, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Feeding the good bacteria can help promote a healthy microbiome, which studies have shown can improve blood sugar control.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, research has found that an imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to poor blood sugar regulation and increased insulin resistance. The prebiotic fibers in chickpea pasta may help cultivate a healthy microbiome, which may lead to improved gut health, glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Has a Low Glycemic Index &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a food raises your blood sugar levels. How does it work? Carbohydrate-containing foods are assigned a number on the GI scale. Those with lower numbers tend to promote a slower, steadier glucose release, while higher numbers are associated with rapid increases in blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ”Foods with a lower GI, like chickpea pasta, break down more slowly, helping prevent sharp spikes and crashes. It’s one reason why this swap feels just as satisfying but leaves you feeling better long after the meal,” says Hawk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As helpful as chickpea pasta is for preventing these spikes, there’s a trick to make it even better: eat it cold in a chickpea pasta salad. The reason? Cooling pasta in the fridge after cooking alters its starch composition for the better, significantly lowering its GI.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have your cake—er, we mean pasta—and eat it too! Even if you choose traditional or whole-wheat pasta, there are ways you can enjoy all types of pasta and keep your blood sugar in a healthy range. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Below, our experts share their top tips to enjoy pasta without the sugar spike. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy It as a Side Dish: &lt;/strong&gt;Many people pile their bowls high with pasta for a main dish. However, Kimberlain recommends serving it as a side dish instead. Aim for a 2-ounce portion of dried pasta, which is roughly 1 cooked cup. Feel free to bulk it up by mixing in lots of nonstarchy veggies and a lean protein.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;: Every dietitian we spoke to recommended loading your pasta bowl with plenty of veggies. “Always include veggies—whether stirred into the pasta or served on the side,” says Peruvemba. Their fiber helps slow down digestion and keeps blood sugar levels in a happy range. From raw to sautéed, roasted or grilled, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Protein helps increase satiety and prevents jumps in blood sugar. Toss chicken, shrimp, salmon, ground turkey, beans or lentils into your pasta or enjoy them as a side dish with your pasta. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Forget Healthy Fats: &lt;/strong&gt;Fat helps you absorb fat-soluble vitamins, supports satiety and prevents blood sugar spikes. Peruvemba recommends drizzling either tahini, olive oil or a nut-based pesto over your pasta for healthy fats. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Your Own Sauce: &lt;/strong&gt;Skip the jarred or canned sauce and try this easy at-home version: “Simmer canned no-salt-added crushed tomatoes with garlic, a pinch of dried oregano, fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil,” says Hawk. “It’s a simple way to cut back on sodium and added sugars that can sneak into store-bought sauces.” Plus, it only takes about 10 minutes to make!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four out of four dietitians agree that chickpea pasta is the No. 1 pasta for better blood sugar. It’s high in fiber, packed with plant-based protein, supports gut health and has a low glycemic index, which all help with blood sugar management. If you’re wondering if it’s still OK to have a little traditional pasta, the answer is yes. To keep blood sugar in check, dietitians recommend small portions of pasta enhanced with plenty of blood sugar–stabilizing nonstarchy veggies, lean protein and healthy fats. Nutrition pros are also big fans of whipping up your own pasta sauce to reduce added sugars and sodium. With these tips, you can build a balanced, blood sugar–friendly pasta meal no matter which noodles you choose.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Not everyone loves dark chocolate, but it loves you. This bitter-tasting treat is another magnesium hack for better-regulated adrenal glands. In fact, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170273/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;according to the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, a 100g bar contains a staggering 228mg of magnesium — a dosage that’s not far off your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-dosage#migraines" target="_blank"&gt;maximum daily allowance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is for chocolate containing 70–85% of cacao solids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, that depends on your personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personality is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“enjoys cake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt; That doesn’t sound very scientifically thorough, but it’s a start. Do you enjoy exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the basis that I’m not a masochist, no, of course not.&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting. And why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, what if I’m at the gym and all the big men look at me?&lt;/strong&gt; In that case I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you fit an established archetype. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250708045648.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; has determined that people with higher levels of neuroticism are less likely to exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; University College London invited 132 volunteers to follow an eight-week exercise course, with questionnaires to fill in about their enjoyment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who doesn’t love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a sweaty questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; After that, they had their personalities assessed to see if they generally exhibited signs of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And all the neurotics hated the exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of. All the neurotics felt shy about exercising in front of other people, and preferred to do light workouts in short bursts away from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the others? &lt;/strong&gt;Those who scored highly in extroversion loved high-intensity training such as weightlifting or spin classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a scientific explanation for why spin classes are so obnoxious.&lt;/strong&gt; However, they didn’t have the best overall fitness. That went to those who scored highly in conscientiousness, because they possessed a better understanding of the long-term benefits of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from underlining how awful extroverts are, what’s the point of all this? &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s understood that exercise is good for you. But perhaps the reason why people don’t do it is because they’re picking the wrong exercise for their personality type. When was the last time you went to the gym?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several years ago. There were lots of big men, and potentially some of them were aware of my existence.&lt;/strong&gt; So that isn’t the right exercise type for your personality. What if you bought some resistance bands and worked out at home every morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, maybe I’d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; stick to that.&lt;/strong&gt; There we go. And you should, especially if you consider yourself neurotic. The study showed that, of all the five main personality types, neurotics were the only group who experienced a significant reduction of stress after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So exercise might make me less neurotic?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s certainly a possibility. And who knows, if you really start enjoying it, you might even become a little bit of an extrovert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going back to bed.&lt;/strong&gt; I suppose that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do say:&lt;/strong&gt; “I should pick a workout that matches my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t say: &lt;/strong&gt;“I hear that cowering at the state of the world burns a ton of calories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOME54LTE0eTQwVXYtRWlpemtEbU1jZTk4STVZX0xpYnlhajFJN3RqQnRpaXNBbkVaTG13Nmkxd2JPWGE1QnNWdk94ZGxGc0xxRnFiZklmdGxTbjRHV1I4OG9LVzRDcHlLa0twOTJHaUdwRkNtQ1FYOV8wTXRwQzFYLUNIX3JSLXA3dmRkTTRhcWtpSXRDcmM0bUdwVlRFTXAwODhkRnN6TzUycmdXWF9TNU9mQVRMZHFGeXFfYVV6ZVl1UQ</guid></item><item><title>三分之一的青少年患有糖尿病前期，新的CDC数据显示- ABC新闻-突发新闻，最新新闻和视频 | 1 in 3 teens have prediabetes, new CDC data shows - ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOZ3dycWN1d0NRZU83ZTZMQ2poZlVGRVVyQ3dsRU5UcHhuYWlFS08tWUFUTENRQ0ZZLUNCakZBRGZ2VG96TG1oeEFJaEdRbjV5bE85YTBWZG5RNGhOdjBxeUJtQmV5RE15Y2d3TWoweENuTllFVjVhcEU0dURiejc3MUtKY2pXYU9lSmlyLUVLTDdRemvSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnJDOVpLWno4MDAyamMyczZ5SHU3eDRDSWFERzJOY3FnMjFmS3dYa3BtcnU1MHZjcWItdXNza1ltQmI1ako1S1NfNzBvRDVWOThTVVlqTWsxMFpIYWs5Nmd6VGlsdndZeDB1ZnNCMmpNazlVSlIxby1WcmduZk9uaTk3VVBHRGxmRVlGTTI5WjVQYXVlcFQ4VXU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;An estimated 1 in 3 teens and preteens, ages 12 to 17, have prediabetes, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-spotlight.html" target="_blank"&gt;new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC data means an estimated 8.4 million young people -- or 32.7% of the U.S. adolescent population -- had prediabetes in 2023, the most recent data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prediabetes, which the CDC calls a "critical warning sign," increases a person's risk of developing Type 2 diabetes as well as other conditions like heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Separate from the new data among teens, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt;new diabetes diagnoses among adults&lt;/a&gt;

Two new analyses suggest the habit might offer real – if limited – protection for adults already at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest evidence comes from a Spanish arm of the long‑running &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684083/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PREDIMED trial&lt;/a&gt;. The study tracked 1,232 older adults following a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and found that those who averaged roughly half to one glass per day had significantly lower heart risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, their risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death dropped by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers verified intake by measuring wine‑derived tartaric acid in urine instead of relying on memory, a switch that turned vague drink logs into hard numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/ramon-estruch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Ramon Estruch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clinic Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chemical-reveals-true-wine-intake"&gt;Chemical reveals true wine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires often miss what people actually pour, so scientists struggle to pin down alcohol’s true effects. Using the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/11/1173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grape‑exclusive metabolite tartaric acid&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to see how much wine someone enjoyed over the previous week without asking them to confess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By measuring tartaric acid in the urine, alongside food and drink questionnaires, we have been able to make a more accurate measurement of wine consumption,” said Estruch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked tartaric acid levels to self-reported wine intake, confirming it as a reliable consumption marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-s-effects-in-mediterranean-diets"&gt;Wine’s effects in Mediterranean diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting such objective tools may help resolve decades of conflicting findings that swing from “red wine is medicine” to “no amount is safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also adjusted for smoking, exercise, and other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;, so the reduced risk cannot be written off as a simple marker of healthier living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, tartaric acid only captures wine, not beer or spirits, letting researchers isolate how fermented &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-chemistry-of-wine-what-actually-shapes-its-texture/"&gt;grape products&lt;/a&gt; behave inside a diet already rich in extra‑virgin olive oil, fish, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That context matters because many of wine’s plant compounds appear to interact with the broader Mediterranean plate, enhancing their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healing-chronic-wounds-with-gold-and-red-wine/"&gt;antioxidant reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-tied-to-small-servings"&gt;Benefits tied to small servings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who logged between three and thirty‑five five‑ounce glasses a month, roughly half to one serving a day, saw their risk of a major cardiac event fall by 50 percent. Light users who stayed below half a glass a day gained a 38 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once intake climbed above one glass each day, the advantage disappeared and, in some analyses, reversed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern mirrors American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which caps daily wine at one five‑ounce serving for women and two for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men, who made up just under half the study group, appeared to draw a stronger benefit. However, statisticians caution that the sex difference may fade in larger samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the favorable range, nurses warned that pouring size matters because many home glasses hold eight or nine ounces, inadvertently nudging people past the safer ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-wine-different"&gt;What makes wine different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine carries a mix of polyphenols such as resveratrol, quercetin, and catechins that seem to boost the lining of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; report that supplemental resveratrol can improve endothelial function, a key factor in healthy blood pressure and clot prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red wine has more antioxidants due to skin fermentation, though white wine still provides some. That biochemical cocktail may partly explain why studies often find beer or spirits lack the same signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate alcohol itself can raise high-density lipoprotein (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/about/ldl-and-hdl-cholesterol-and-triglycerides.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HDL&lt;/a&gt;), the so‑called “good” cholesterol, yet ethanol also raises triglycerides and blood pressure at larger doses. Polyphenols may tilt the equation back toward benefit, but only within a narrow window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-too-much-wine-harms-the-heart"&gt;Too much wine harms the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 systematic &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that pooled data from 4.8 million people found no reduction in all‑cause mortality among moderate drinkers once misclassified former drinkers were excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors warned that earlier optimism probably stemmed from comparing social drinkers with people who quit because of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy pouring is indisputably harmful. Even &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/07/31/even-just-1-alcoholic-drink-a-day-may-increase-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one extra daily drink&lt;/a&gt; can raise systolic blood pressure by two to four millimeters of mercury, a change large enough to push many people into hypertension. Elevated pressure strains arteries, sets the stage for arrhythmias, and accelerates heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcoholresearchforum.org/members/giovanni-de-gaetano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Giovanni de Gaetano&lt;/a&gt; noted that the biomarker approach “provides robust evidence that moderate wine consumption is associated with lower CVD risk. He cautioned that the same data “remind us of the risks associated with higher levels of consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also carries addictive potential, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that roughly &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2014/p0626-excessive-drinking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in ten deaths&lt;/a&gt; among working‑age adults is tied to excessive drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sobering statistic explains why public health agencies repeat that zero is the only completely risk‑free dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-humans-and-heart-health"&gt;Wine, humans, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults older than about 35 who already follow a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a small glass of wine with supper may fit comfortably into a heart‑conscious lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are pregnant, taking interacting medications, or battling addiction should not take the PREDIMED results as a green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrients that give wine its appeal, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-wine-consumption-reduces-cardiovascular-risks/"&gt;including resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, also reside in grapes, blueberries, nuts, and olive oil. Anyone who chooses to skip alcohol can still obtain similar antioxidant support without ethanol’s downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians emphasize that no one should start drinking for health reasons. Instead, the sensible takeaway is that very modest wine, enjoyed with meals and within established limits, is unlikely to harm.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher protein intake—especially leucine and lysine—was linked to lower DKD risk in diabetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both animal and plant foods offer protective amino acids; variety is key for kidney health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant-based proteins with fiber may support blood sugar control and overall kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and with it, associated complications, like diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Diabetic kidney disease is the primary cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a leading contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic kidney disease also raises your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes, you know that protein is essential to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-8411479" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;there is evidence suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291875/6-signs-you-could-be-eating-too-much-protein/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;too much protein&lt;/a&gt;, especially from animal sources, raises the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-11762971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;risk of kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;. Plant protein, however, has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-11762971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;prevent or slow down kidney function decline&lt;/a&gt;. With that said, the evidence is inconclusive, and the 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative states that there is not enough conclusive evidence to recommend one type of protein over another.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, the Initiative lumps all types together and recommends that people with diabetes or kidney disease who are not on dialysis restrict their protein intake to 0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. This is also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people without diabetes, though that recommendation may be too low for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Taiwan wanted to take a closer look at &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proteins and amino acids&lt;/a&gt;—the building blocks of protein— and their associations with diabetic kidney disease. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited 378 participants with type 2 diabetes; half were women with an average age of 63. Based on urine tests, participants were split into two groups: those with just diabetes and those with diabetic kidney disease. Of the 378 participants, 237 were categorized as having diabetes without kidney disease, and 141 met the criteria for kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Through structured interviews with registered dietitians, participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires at baseline. From their responses, protein amount and types were calculated. They were then placed into one of three categories based on their protein consumption: less than 0.8 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight (Group 1),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;0.9-1.2 g/kg (Group 2) and more than 1.3 g/kg (Group 3). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also at baseline, demographics like age, sex, diabetes duration and medication use were captured, along with BMI and waist circumference. Blood pressure was measured, and bloodwork was done for fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), both screenings for kidney disease, were calculated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1, which had the lowest overall protein intake, also had the lowest mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (78), followed by Group 2 (85) and Group 3 (87). Typically, a normal eGFR is 90 or higher, and 89 to 60 indicates mild loss of kidney function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1’s serum creatinine levels also suggested lower renal (kidney) function; they also had the highest fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c (an average of blood glucose over three months) and microalbumin levels (UACR). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then broke down types of protein into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Amino acids are what proteins are made of. There are 20 primary amino acids necessary for humans, nine of which are essential amino acids. They’re essential because we need to get them from food, as our bodies cannot make them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What surfaced after statistical analyses were run was that higher overall protein intake, as well as higher intake of certain amino acids—branched-chain (BCAA), aromatic (AAA) and ketogenic amino acids—were all independently associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. In particular, leucine and lysine, two essential amino acids, were most strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers concluded that for non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients, in addition to the recommended total protein intake, the balance of amino acid patterns should be considered. They suggest that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids and histidine, and restriction of tyrosine, methionine and glutamic acid—all amino acids found in higher concentrations in meat—may serve as nutritional strategies to support kidney function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors note that their findings align with previous studies, suggesting that ketogenic amino acids, in particular, leucine and lysine, may help protect against diabetic kidney disease. While found in many foods, leucine and lysine are abundant in: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dairy, like milk, yogurt and cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds and nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meat, like pork, chicken, turkey, venison, bison and lean beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy products, like tempeh, tofu and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains, like quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you can see, it’s a nice mix of animal and plant proteins that contain these essential amino acids. Whether you have diabetes or not, it’s important to include a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-vegetarian-foods-11762306" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant proteins&lt;/a&gt; are definitely worth prioritizing, as they often include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to incorporate more plant-based proteins but aren’t sure where to start, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960416/vegetarian-meal-plan-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;7-Day Vegetarian Meal Plan for Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with tasty, plant-based meals and snacks, with some dairy and eggs sprinkled in. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and struggle with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, consider how much protein you’re eating. Fiber is another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/two-surprising-nutrients-may-impact-blood-sugar-11718212" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;important nutrient for controlling blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and it works even better when combined with protein. Many sources of plant protein will offer both of those nutrients. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/misconception-about-protein-survey-11701426" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Combining animal proteins with a plant source&lt;/a&gt; is another great way to get protein and fiber into your day. For example, yogurt with fruit and nuts or tuna with veggies are filling, tasty options.

Because a variety of foods contain these essential amino acids, there is likely something on the list you’ll enjoy.

They &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/menopause-symptoms-alzheimers-dementia-b2745425.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:also undergo menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;also undergo menopause&lt;/a&gt;: a process that occurs when a woman’s reproductive hormones naturally decline starting in her 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer's, or another dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer’s disease are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Epidemiologically, we see that for almost all neurological diseases, there are differences in how many biological women and men are affected,” Anna Bonkhoff, resident and research fellow in neurology at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham, explained in a recent &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/07/why-are-women-twice-as-likely-to-develop-alzheimers-as-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s a tendency, for example, in [multiple sclerosis] and migraine for more females to be affected, while it’s the contrary for brain tumors and Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Just based on these numbers, you get the feeling that something needs to underlie these differences in terms of the biology,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease as men. Now researchers are working to nail down why (Getty Images/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking inside the body, while women have two “X” chromosomes, men have an “X” and a “Y.” Chromosomes are thread-like structures of DNA inside our cells that &lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/ChildrensWI/en/kids/word-chromosomes.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carry hundreds or even thousands of genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;carry hundreds or even thousands of genes&lt;/a&gt;. Genes determine a person’s physical characteristics. Differences between genes held on the X and Y chromosomes may give women an increased chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research has shown that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2823160" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genes on the X chromosome are related to Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genes on the X chromosome are related to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, including that &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/757913" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women with Alzheimer’s live longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;women with Alzheimer’s live longer&lt;/a&gt; than men with the disease due to their second X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of genes for the immune system and regulating brain structure are located on the X chromosome, so the dosages differ to certain degrees between men and women. That seems to have an effect,” said Bonkhoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women’s different dominant hormones — such as estrogen, which acts on the brain — could also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Menopause is part of the puzzle, probably one of the bigger ones,” Bonkhoff said. “I’m not saying it’s the only one — aging is relevant by itself, and there’s a lot of interesting research looking at what aging does to the immune system that seems to have implications for cognitive changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During menopause, when ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, some women turn to hormone replacement therapy. The practice offers relief for symptoms of lower hormone levels in menopause such as hot flashes. But for some women it may increase their risk of dangerous medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, blood clots and gall bladder disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/menopause" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause is ‘part of the puzzle,’ researchers say. People who received hormone replacement therapy to alleviate symptoms of menopause exhibited one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (Getty Images/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women who received hormone replacement after age 70 also have significantly higher levels of the protein known as “tau,” according to Rachel Buckley, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. The accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. They also suffered higher cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Buckley published those findings last March in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt1288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Advances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But further research is needed to understand these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We work with a lot of secondary data that already exists, and that’s great but there are limitations to what we can do with it,” Buckley said. “We’re trying to see if we can set up a new study design where we can really look at the time of menopause, what is changing in the blood, what is changing in the brain, what is changing in cognition, and how that might be associated with later life risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:40:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPTnNEZlZ2YjJYVll5bnBHNmlUMk1jX2N5NG0xRGZjMGgwMDYzM05yVjlvNDlSVVAzdU5tekFtdUwwOTZoTThDNHBLdHVndzRKcE9KYnpsOFBISlB4SDJweVltelFPYzhSQ1RRU08tMF8tOVpqd0t1MXFoamkyVF9QOW9Zbw</guid></item><item><title>是芒果！哪些葡萄糖追踪器能捕捉到实验室检测漏掉的东西-《印度时报》 | It was the mangoes!

Pushpa Narayan speaks to Dr Vijay Viswanathan, president of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI), about how these wearables are helping in diabetes management. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How good are CGMs at monitoring blood sugar levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wearables give real-time information about glucose levels, providing greater insight into the body’s sugar trends than traditional finger-prick tests. CGMs can show how different foods, exercise, sleep, and stress impact a person’s glucose levels 24x7. This data helps doctors offer dietary and medicinal adjustments to optimise blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest CGMs can detect early signs of impaired glucose tolerance or prediabetes even in those with normal HbA1c (2-3 month blood sugar average) levels. Also, the feedback can motivate people with diabetes to adopt healthier lifestyle choices such as regular physical activity and balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Did You Know? Mangoes Are Low On Calories And Supports Heart Health!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When do you recommend them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In specific cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a patient whose HbA1c was 6.1, which is very good control for a person with diabetes, but the fasting and postprandial (after a meal) sugar levels were extremely high. We found it was possibly because my patient had been eating mangoes almost every day. HbA1c is the gold standard but doesn’t reveal glucose fluctuations that occur throughout the day. A normal HbA1c with frequent low and high blood sugar indicates wide swings that the average doesn’t capture. A high HbA1c despite ‘good’ clinic readings could mean post-meal spikes or overnight high sugar that are not being captured by intermittent testing. We recommend a CGM when a patient’s average might be masking significant glycemic variability. It provides the timing, magnitude, and frequency of fluctuations, allowing doctors to pinpoint the root cause of disparity and adjust meal plans and medical treatment accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are they tools to improve diagnosis?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. For instance, the Somogyi phenomenon or rebound hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and the Dawn phenomenon are two distinct causes of high morning blood sugar in people with diabetes. Somogyi phenomenon occurs when an episode of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine which work to raise blood sugar. In diabetics who lack sufficient insulin, this mechanism can overshoot, leading to high blood sugar levels in the morning. Dawn phenomenon is a more natural process where the hormones cause a blood sugar rise between 2am and 8am to prepare for waking. These hormones increase insulin resistance and signal the liver to produce more glucose. In those without diabetes, the pancreas releases enough insulin but not in diabetics, leading to elevated blood sugar levels upon waking. Unlike Somogyi phenomenon, Dawn phenomenon is not preceded by a hypoglycemic event. It’s important to distinguish between the two as treatment varies. CGMs help the caregiver diagnose, adjust insulin dosage and medication timing, with better long-term health outcomes and lower risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="_oWMq   "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information overload can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with food among healthy folk. Not to mention needless expense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="DuPus"&gt;Dr Viswanathan&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even healthy people are using CGMs as a predictive health tool to prevent diabetes. Would you recommend it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors’ bodies, including RSSDI, are cautious about recommending widespread use in healthy people as the need is not yet proven. Also, most devices have algorithms tailored only to a diabetic’s needs, which can lead to data misinterpretation. There’s also the danger of an information overload that can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with eating among healthy folk. Not to mention the needless spending. That said, manufacturers have designed over-the-counter devices for those who don’t use insulin and are not at severe risk of low blood sugar. For healthy people, I would recommend a balanced diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight for glucose management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can CGMs help kids and the elderly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They greatly reduce the need for painful finger-prick tests that kids may dislike and the elderly may have difficulty with. Both may be more susceptible to hypoglycemia and may not experience typical symptoms. A CGM can provide life-saving alerts for low glucose that would help prevent severe episodes. And modern CGMs are often user-friendly, which can benefit older adults with cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxQRXZzQUhZRzJrV2JuN2pPampMVEljSENiU2UzNFd5NWhBNWloWGZ3YkhnYTZyak96VDhHYnhSeU5yNFVqRTNnek5uOWtjUmhDdUt1WEZpdzVSVlp1bmxYcGpuQ0dEblh6Zkw5bkJPcXRBWllYcU96cDZqNHU2bWhyTThIT1NZcXFYNVpaQlVITGE5YWRVMjFhYmpVNUJBM1dzbHBCanNVZG1vUTF0UXJpRWZZZ2FCSHNTNWo3YjUwUmdiaGNPVmQ0QjYxOWoyODNWZFZTSDBjZDRnejRfN29tUm5tQ01vTFZlYXlIZFc4VDVpd1JYaHdwMk1R0gH_AUFVX3lxTE5LelBvcDNGeXAwX2w2M1htNVNLR05yakFfVzlVZW91eU9FcllqQWV0NV9iV3ZZSWJSZDUwaVpaWF9lc2Q0TVMtTXNicnFlSDJlc0ZpNW1seTNPWTFJR1ZKMm1xZHJ4clRTSE5lOE5mWDVpWElDNFNsQVVJMGVoY0JDRjdkeWpUd2FrUzdUamdoX3lVYzZxS1Fva25tWUdWWTBiZ0xlRG1LQlZtZWx6UnJSUEllczEwenhCTVo5N1RQWGpWMTR5RUZLeFNRbnRBZ2k4dGE0UWd0aTk4SDgwdXRGaTI5QlMtVS1RVmYwbVdCeXdzQ2l4a2RscU1SVnhyZw</guid></item><item><title>我以为这只是一个痘痘。实际诊断结果让我大吃一惊。- AOL.com | I Thought It Was Just A Zit.

For months, I thought nothing of it. But then the spot started turning red last December. “Maybe it’s just a pimple,” I thought to myself. A week went by. Then another. And another. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:annoying bump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;annoying bump&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t changing in size, color, or tenderness like a normal zit would—and I was starting to get a little worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This peculiar blemish was painless, but it wasn’t showing any signs of fading and I didn’t like how it looked. So, I figured I’d bring it up to my dermatologist, &lt;a href="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hooman Khorasani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hooman Khorasani&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon in private practice in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked a little suspicious because he could see blood vessels that aren’t normally visible in certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:types of acne;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;types of acne&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t immediately assume it was something serious like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I was only 31 years old at the time, and incidences of skin cancer rise sharply in those who are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:75 or older;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;75 or older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But to be on the safe side, Dr. Khorasani collected a small piece of skin tissue and sent it to a lab to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was wait for him to contact me with the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the phone rang, my heart sank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at my desk in my Manhattan office building finishing up a day of work as a marketing professional in the beauty industry when Dr. Khorasani called and told me that the mysterious spot on my forehead was actually &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:basal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;basal cell carcinoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the most common form of skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the most common form of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that this type of cancer results from mutations in skin cells called keratinocytes. These mutations can be sporadic and happen randomly, but they’re often caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, or artificial radiation from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tanning beds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tanning beds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing that I had “the Big C” was scary, but I felt like I was in good hands with Dr. Khorasani. He reassured me that we caught the lesion early and that the prognosis of basal cell carcinoma is excellent. We made an appointment to surgically remove the spot a couple weeks after I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is never a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time to get cancer. But my diagnosis came during a particularly hectic time in my personal and professional lives. For one, I had just married my husband, Sam, in September, and we were really looking forward to a mini honeymoon in Tulum, Mexico, in early February. Knowing I'd still be healing with my forehead covered with bandages, we decided to postpone the trip by several weeks. Around the same time, I was also given a thrilling opportunity to represent my company at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. But like my upcoming vacation, I had to back out and stay home in Brooklyn to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was scared to have a scar on my forehead forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduling conflicts weren't the only thing that made my diagnosis frustrating. Even in the hands of one of the world’s top dermatologic and cosmetic surgeons, I still dreaded the permanent scar I would have on my forehead. After all, it’s not a spot that’s particularly easy to conceal from others. But come January 28th, Dr. Khorasani performed what’s called a Mohs micrographic surgery on my face. The procedure is done in stages, meaning Dr. Khorasani removed the cancerous skin cells bit by bit to ensure he spared the surrounding healthy tissue and minimized the size of the scar left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Emily Haley the day she had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure took about five hours and, all things considered, it was pretty easy and painless for me. What came after that took a larger toll: I was forced to wear white gauze on my forehead in the weeks following my surgery, and it was really awkward to explain why I looked the way I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted. I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever. And that’s because in the weeks and months following my procedure, Dr. Khorasani has—and continues—to perform several procedures to help improve the appearance of my scar. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dermabrasion gently polishes the outermost surface of the scar to help smooth out any uneven texture. And CO₂ laser resurfacing uses a beam of light to precisely remove tiny columns of skin. When that skin heals, more collagen is produced which helps the scar tissue more closely resemble normal skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vascular laser treatment&lt;/strong&gt;: This procedure involves using a beam of light to target and remove blood vessels in the skin, which reduces unwanted redness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bellafill injections&lt;/strong&gt;: These gel injections help correct contour abnormalities from the scar, like raised areas or indentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Botox: &lt;/strong&gt;This injection helps relax the muscles in the forehead so they don't pull on the incision and stretch the scar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the healing process since the surgery hasn’t always been picture-perfect (my scar looks especially red immediately after treatments) but on good days, I’m happy to say that you’d hardly know the scar is there thanks to all the help from my doctor and his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin cancer is a risk for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom has olive skin, but I inherited my father’s fair complexion, which &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/skin-type/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:naturally raises my risk of skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naturally raises my risk of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and makes sun care all the more important. Some people can also inherit &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain genes&lt;/a&gt; that raise their risk of developing the disease. So growing up, my parents drilled into me the importance of wearing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, not just while lounging on the beach in the summer, but every day, all year round. And despite spending most of my childhood indoors, at a dance studio in my hometown in Wisconsin, applying the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:right amount of sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;right amount of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; multiple times a day was second nature to my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, my mom developed basal cell carcinoma on her chest when she was in her 60s, which was about seven or eight years ago. And when I was a child, my dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s. My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tanning beds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/a&gt;, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve become a hat girly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my diagnosis, I’ve become even more diligent about protecting my skin. Like always, I make sure to apply (and re-apply) sunscreen throughout the day, using products with an SPF of at least 35, as my doctor recommends. And my day-to-day plans don't determine whether I protect my skin. It doesn’t matter if I’m going for a long walk under the sun or leaving my home for a quick grocery run on a rainy day. Wearing sunscreen is like brushing my teeth—a non-negotiable part of my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I know that I’ll be spending some extra time outdoors, I do like to take extra precautions. During my trip to Tulum, for instance, I wore rash guards while lounging by the pool and beach, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in a cabana rather than exposing myself to direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also now visit my dermatologist for cancer screenings every six months instead of annually, as is recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And I plan to pay for &lt;a href="https://molesafe.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer surveillance services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;skin cancer surveillance services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once a year. The clinic I go to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of my whole body to determine whether I’ve developed any cancerous moles. But perhaps the most fun change in my life has been learning how to embrace wearing protective hats. Sun hats, baseball caps, bucket hats, you name it! Hats that offer coverage from the sun are a new staple of my personal style. And I’m enjoying experimenting and incorporating them into my outfits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Emily Haley enjoying her vacation in Tulum, Mexico, while protecting her skin.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of walking around with various hats and scar coverings, I no longer worry what other people think of me or how I look. When someone asks about my scar, I’m happy to share my story. Because if opening up helps even one person catch something early, protect their skin, or feel less alone, then it’s all been worth it. And in the meantime? I’ll be rocking my favorite hat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:15:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5xU0dlbFVGNEFRdnJxck5QeU5lSFhvbl9nSlBGSmlJeWtYbURnU2FQZ1BzNDNvRHpMeWQ5THFJcEUyeUtwUi1lajRlU3NoR1kxVHZqODZ6Y3o0M2huT0NxZWVrM3FkdGt1SVVGX0tGVVFmUC1Db2Yw</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家解读人们如何在工作记忆中处理多个项目- PsyPost | Neuroscientists decode how people juggle multiple items in working memory - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPTUNSTzFSTU1salgydmZNa3V5Y041YmZrUWpKTktxSnNkR08yNHR4UGpXRWRmN3Qxa0thSkFWX1MtcFFoQ3RNX1NhQlZjWGpSbW1ZTmFwN0lqdTVGdzZBYU9FcUxyM2NFMXhZdXRMSHljTC0xNE5MeGxOT2lVWVZibUtnbExIX0ZVZmFUS1lfWDlJRkdDa1ZXb0ozbkNsS28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we try to remember more than one thing at a time, our brains don’t treat each item equally. New research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr8015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; shows that the brain dynamically adjusts how much effort it devotes to each item based on its importance. By tracking brain activity while people remembered two locations on a screen, scientists discovered that two brain regions—the visual cortex and the frontal cortex—work together to allocate more resources to items deemed more important. This results in sharper, more precise memory for high-priority items, while low-priority ones are remembered with less clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Hsin-Hung Li at The Ohio State University, wanted to understand how the brain deals with the fact that working memory is limited. Working memory helps us temporarily store information we need for things like making decisions, solving problems, or navigating the world. But it can only hold a small amount of information at a time. Past studies have shown that people can improve their memory for important items by prioritizing them. But scientists did not know how the brain manages this internally or what parts of the brain make those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the researchers developed a method to measure how the brain represents multiple items held in memory at once and how it adjusts those representations based on priority. They combined functional MRI brain scans with a sophisticated computational model that could decode what participants were remembering—and how precisely they were remembering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved 11 participants who each took part in several scanning sessions. While lying in an MRI scanner, participants looked at a screen where two colored lines appeared briefly—each in a different half of the screen. Before the lines appeared, a cue indicated which side of the screen was more likely to be tested later, marking one of the items as high-priority and the other as low-priority. After the lines disappeared, participants had to wait 12 seconds while trying to remember their locations. Then, they were prompted to look with their eyes at the location of one of the items, using a quick eye movement known as a saccade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most trials, the high-priority item was the one tested, but in a smaller number of trials, the low-priority item was selected instead. Eye-tracking data allowed researchers to measure how accurate each memory was, depending on whether it was high or low in priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants were consistently better at remembering the high-priority item. Their eye movements landed closer to the correct location, and they responded more quickly when recalling high-priority information. These results confirmed that people can adjust their memory performance based on what they think will matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made this study unique was its ability to decode brain activity related to each memory item—separately and in real time. Using a model rooted in a theory called probabilistic population coding, the team translated patterns of brain activity in the visual cortex into predictions about what the participant was remembering and how certain their brain was about it. They showed that high-priority items were encoded with more “gain,” meaning the brain devoted more neural resources to representing them. These representations were not only stronger but also more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing data from both the visual and frontal areas of the brain, the researchers were able to go a step further. They found that activity in the frontal cortex predicted how much emphasis was placed on the high-priority item. The frontal cortex didn’t store the memory itself, but it seemed to decide which item deserved more attention. Once that decision was made, it influenced how the visual cortex represented each item. This suggests a kind of top-down control: the frontal cortex acts like a manager, telling the visual system how to distribute limited memory resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trials where the high-priority item received more gain in the visual cortex, participants made fewer mistakes when recalling it. The researchers also showed that when the brain was less certain about an item—reflected by more “noisy” neural activity—participants took longer to respond and were more likely to make errors. This indicated a strong link between the brain’s internal sense of certainty and actual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also identified a specific part of the frontal cortex, the superior precentral sulcus, as playing a key role in prioritization. Activity in this region increased when participants were allocating more memory resources to the high-priority item. Its activity also predicted quicker response times, especially when participants felt more certain about the remembered location. In addition, the researchers found involvement from parts of the parietal cortex and a region in the temporal lobe called the posterior inferior temporal cortex—areas that are known to participate in attention and visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results help clarify how different brain regions coordinate to prioritize memories, the study had some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, with only 11 participants, which may limit how generalizable the findings are. The tasks were also highly controlled and may not reflect how working memory operates in everyday settings where people remember many types of information at once, not just spatial locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that although the researchers could estimate how much “gain” was assigned to each item, they could not directly measure how this translated into specific neural firing rates at the level of individual neurons. Future studies might combine brain imaging with methods that can capture more detailed neural activity to get a fuller picture of how memory prioritization works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these caveats, the study offers a new way to look at working memory. It suggests that rather than being a fixed bucket that can only hold a few items, working memory is a flexible system that can shift resources from one item to another depending on its relevance. The frontal cortex helps manage this process by signaling which memories deserve more attention, while the visual cortex adjusts how clearly those memories are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Hsin-Hung Li noted that this is one of the first studies to decode the brain’s memory for two different items on a single trial. He believes this technique could be useful for exploring many situations where people try to hold multiple thoughts in their minds at once. “There are so many situations in which people are trying to hold multiple thoughts in their minds and it is very useful to be able decode more than one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr8015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neural mechanisms of resource allocation in working memory&lt;/a&gt;,” Hsin- Hung Li, Thomas C.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using sophisticated computational modeling and machine learning, researchers discovered how astrocytes, a “star” shaped glial cell, subtly – but significantly – modulate communication between neurons, especially during highly coordinated, synchronous brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, glial cells are significantly implicated in several brain functions, making identifying their presence among neurons an appealing and important problem,” said Rodrigo Pena, Ph.D., senior author, an assistant professor of biological sciences within FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science on the John D. MacArthur Campus in Jupiter, and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To that end, modeling can be helpful. However, the simulation of the complex interactions between glial cells and neurons is a challenging task that requires advanced computational approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, in collaboration with the Federal University of São Carlos and the University of São Paulo in Brazil, addresses a fundamental gap in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While neurons have long dominated the conversation, glial cells – and predominantly astrocytes – have been treated as passive support structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But recent discoveries have challenged this neuron-centric view, suggesting astrocytes are active participants in processes like synaptic modulation, energy regulation and even network coordination,” said Laura Fontenas, Ph.D., co-author, an assistant professor of biological sciences within FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science on the John D. MacArthur Campus, and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Neurodynamics,&lt;/em&gt; takes those ideas further, showing that astrocytes influence how groups of neurons fire together, especially when the brain is in a “synchronous” state – where large populations of neurons fire in a coordinated rhythm, a condition crucial for functions like attention, memory formation and sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the team generated artificial brain network data and applied a suite of machine learning models including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, and Feedforward Neural Networks to classify and detect the influence of astrocytes under different network states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings reveal that Feedforward Neural Networks emerged as the most effective, especially in asynchronous (less coordinated) conditions, where capturing subtle patterns required richer and more complex data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to identify the presence of glial cells in synaptic transmission using different machine-learning methods, which do not require strong assumptions about the data,” said Pena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the Mean Firing Rate – a common experimental measure – was particularly effective in helping these models detect glial influences, especially when paired with robust algorithms like Feedforward Neural Networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Fontenas, the researchers can now investigate these computational findings in appropriate animal models such as in the Zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s key findings is that astrocytes exert their strongest influence during synchronous brain states. In these conditions, advanced statistical tools such as spike-train coherence, which measures the timing relationships between neural signals, detected a shift toward more coordinated and frequency-diverse firing when astrocytes were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that astrocytes not only support but may also fine-tune the rhythmic dynamics of brain networks, potentially contributing to stability and information flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even with the difficulties of identifying the presence of glial cells, our study highlights the utility of machine learning in detecting their influence within neural networks, particularly by leveraging the Mean Firing Rate as an effective data collection method,” Pena said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional brain activity metrics like firing rate and coefficient of variation often miss these subtleties. The study shows that although astrocytes affect network behavior, their contributions don’t always produce large changes in conventional measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, detecting their influence requires more nuanced tools – ones that can see beyond the obvious and identify the deeper patterns in brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science continues to unravel the complexities of the human mind, this study is a reminder that some of the brain’s most important contributors have long gone unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to machine learning and computational neuroscience, the invisible influence of astrocytes is now coming into view – and with it, a richer, more complete picture of how the brain really works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By enhancing our ability to detect glial influence through advanced statistical methods, we open new avenues for exploring how neuron-glia interactions shape brain function,” said Pena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a critical step toward understanding neurological disorders and could inform future therapies that target not just neurons, but the entire cellular ecosystem of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-authors are João Pedro Pirola, first author and a student at the Federal University of São Carlos working in the Pena lab; Paige DeForest, a recent graduate from FAU’s Wilkes Honors College; Paulo R.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compound found in psychedelic mushrooms may have antiaging properties. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have found that psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, may extend both cellular and organismal lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;npj Aging&lt;/i&gt;, show that psilocybin reduced multiple hallmarks of aging in cells while also improving survival in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There have been a number of clinical studies that have explored the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety; however, few studies have evaluated its impacts outside the brain," said Dr. Louise Hecker, associate professor of medicine—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular research&lt;/a&gt; at Baylor and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The overwhelming majority of what we know about psilocybin is how it impacts the brain. Our findings suggest that psilocybin has potent effects on the entire body, including antiaging properties, which also may contribute to the plethora of observed beneficial clinical outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres, the protective caps of repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, shorten as we age—telomere shortening is a classic hallmark of aging. Hecker's research suggests that psilocybin treatment preserves telomere length, which contributes to cellular life extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, using human cells, the team found that psilocybin extended cellular lifespan by up to 57% depending on dosages. In cells, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) delayed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cellular+senescence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cellular senescence&lt;/a&gt;, preserved telomere length and reduced oxidative stress levels. Their findings also suggest it leads to increased SIRT1 expression, which is associated with regulating longevity, as well as other cellular markers indicating improved DNA damage responses.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study also showed that when psilocybin was administered to aged mice (the equivalent to a 60-year-old in human age), mice showed significantly improved survival compared to control mice. Researchers also noted a visible improvement in fur quality, which suggests healthier aging, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a very exciting and clinically relevant finding that suggests that even when intervention is initiated late in life, it can have dramatic impacts," said Dr. Kosuke Kato, lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine—pulmonary at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open an exciting new chapter in psychedelic research beyond its neurological and psychological benefits," Hecker said. "Psilocybin may represent a disruptive agent that promotes healthy aging. The next steps need to explore the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt; across multiple age-related diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important to note that additional research is needed to validate these findings in human studies," Kato said. "There is still a lot to understand, including optimal dosing protocols that will lead to maximal efficacy. We also need to better understand the potential risks of long-term psilocybin treatment before this type of treatment is ready for public use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once validated in human studies, the use of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psilocybin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; could offer new options for healthy aging and potentially age-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that leisure-time activities like yoga or team sports tend to improve mood more than obligatory tasks like housework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as social interactions, environment, and even instructor style can profoundly influence how exercise affects mental well-being. The findings suggest that tailoring exercise to personal preferences and settings may enhance its positive impact on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Counts:&lt;/strong&gt; Social setting, purpose, and enjoyment of exercise shape its mental health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leisure Wins:&lt;/strong&gt; Voluntary activities show stronger effects than obligatory or stressful exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailored Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding personal and situational factors can improve outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research often points to exercise as a good way to boost mental health, but a recent study from the University of Georgia suggests that it’s not just physical movement that affects mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s how, where and why you exercise that makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, physical activity research has focused on how long someone exercises for or how many calories were burned,” said Patrick O’Connor, co-author of the study and a professor in the Mary Frances Early College of Education’s Department of Kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111462"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-300x233.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-770x599.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-293x228.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-150x117.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and people exercising." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-300x233.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-770x599.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-293x228.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘dose’ of exercise has been the dominant way researchers have tried to understand how physical activity might influence mental health, while often ignoring whether those minutes were spent exercising with a friend or as part of a game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows that leisure-time physical activity — like going for a run, taking a yoga class or biking for fun — correlates with better mental health outcomes, these benefits may vary significantly depending on the environment and circumstances surrounding the activity, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze these factors, the researchers reviewed three types of studies. These included large-scale epidemiological studies that examined health patterns in populations, randomized controlled trials where some groups received exercise treatments and others did not, and a much smaller but growing set of investigations into contextual factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise and mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies found that people who engage in regular leisure-time physical activity tend to report lower levels of depression and anxiety. But it’s less clear for other forms of activity like cleaning the house or working for a lawn care company. The context may matter as much as the intensity or amount of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if a soccer player runs down the field and kicks the game-winning ball, their mental health is fantastic,” O’Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, if you do the exact same exercise but miss the goal and people are blaming you, you likely feel very differently. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous randomized controlled trials also showed that adopting regular exercise routines boosted mental health, especially for individuals with existing mental health disorders. However, these studies were typically based on small, short-term and homogenous samples, so the results likely aren’t generalizable to larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The average effects on mental health are small across all the randomized controlled studies of exercise, and that’s partly because most of the studies focused on people who were not depressed or anxious — you do get bigger effects in those studies,” added O’Connor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re communicating to scientists that larger- and longer-term controlled studies are needed to make a compelling case whether exercise does, or does not, truly impact mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why context matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the evidence is thinnest — but potentially most important — is in understanding contextual factors. The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context can range from peer dynamics and instructor style to external conditions like weather or time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re outside and it’s hot, and you’re having to walk to work, that’s part of the context,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Or if you go and take a group exercise class — some instructors you really like, and some you don’t. So, that’s also part of the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to help people’s mental health with exercise, then not only do we need to think about the dose and the mode, we also need to ask: What is the context?” O’Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For O’Connor, the takeaway is clear. It’s not just movement that matters. It’s the meaning, the setting and the experience surrounding the activity that determines the impact of exercise on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors of the study include Eduardo Bustamante of the University of Illinois Chicago; Angelique Brellenthin of Iowa State University; and David Brown, who recently retired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2b4844474e5844584e494e4e6b5e4c4a054e4f5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cole Sosebee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uga.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cole Sosebee – University of Georgia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000003636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Up for Debate: Does Regular Physical Activity Really Improve Mental Health?&lt;/a&gt;” by Patrick O’Connor et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up for Debate: Does Regular Physical Activity Really Improve Mental Health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is frequently touted as beneficial for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, based on a 2023 ACSM colloquium, highlights key strengths and limitations of the evidence regarding physical activity and mental health from three perspectives: epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trial experiments, and investigations that explicitly consider the potential role that contextual factors, such as the social climate in which physical activity is completed, can play in physical activity–mental health interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large body of epidemiological evidence supports that regular leisure time physical activity is associated with less depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher amounts of physical activity are often associated with fewer depressive symptoms, but there may be a dose–response point where for some people more is not better but can plateau or even worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological evidence is emerging but currently inadequate to support associations between mental health and occupational, transportation/active commuting, or domestic/household physical activity types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large body of randomized controlled trials, typically small, short duration and conducted with samples biased toward middle-to-higher socioeconomic status Whites, supports that the adoption of regular exercise improves aspects of mental health; however, the mechanisms are unclear and for those without mental disorders the mean effects are small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health benefits of exercise may be partially a placebo response or result from contextual factors surrounding exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small body of evidence supports that contextual elements, such as the program implementation quality and social environment, can influence the mental health outcomes associated with physical activity programs, but the evidence is currently inadequate to identify which contextual variables have consistent moderate or larger effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater progress will be made in this area when research designs are expanded to include consideration of the potential influence of contextual factors on relationships between physical activity and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 20:50:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE41cEpIVV9BNHNnbmpTM3Jxb3hFMFdxNDYyTWdMUDhPVTRxMzQyMlI2WDNoRWE2Wmo5aW5YMnJFWVJCdC0zYy1sbTh6UUc2NkR6ZFI2MGJvQk9kaVkwbFBHRDVKNmxiS1Z2alZrN1dPSzBIVThN</guid></item></channel></rss>
