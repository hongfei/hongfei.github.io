			&lt;p&gt;A recipient of a kidney transplant presented a medical mystery when he died from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrdp.2017.91"&gt;rabies&lt;/a&gt; in January 2025 only weeks after his surgery in an Ohio hospital, despite having had no documented contact with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close investigation by the CDC revealed the cause: The Michigan man's donor kidney was infected by the deadly  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; – only the fourth time rabies has been transmitted via transplanted organs in the US since 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, the CDC says, highlights the need for stronger guidance for transplant teams where the donor has a history of exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rabies-is-a-deadly-unpredictable-threat-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabies Is a Deadly, Unpredictable Threat. Here's How to Protect Yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral pathogen that spreads typically via the saliva of infected animals, usually through bites or scratches. Capable of infecting all mammals, including humans, the disease is almost always fatal once symptoms appear; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0711"&gt;fewer than 50&lt;/a&gt; cases of survival have been documented worldwide, with medical specialists rarely succeeding in keeping patients alive despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaf157"&gt;extreme measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt; most often occurs from dog bites, but any infected mammal can transmit the disease. The donor in this case, an Idaho man, had been found unresponsive after a presumed cardiac arrest in early December 2024, around five weeks after being scratched by a skunk in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one suspected the involvement of rabies at the time. So as the man was an organ donor, his heart, lungs, left kidney, and corneas were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five weeks after receiving the kidney, the Michigan patient developed symptoms consistent with rabies. Doctors sent samples of his saliva, skin, and other fluids to the CDC, which detected rabies virus RNA in some of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the recipient had no history of animal exposure, investigators turned back to the donor. A stored serum sample from the Idaho man tested negative for rabies  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="184534" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, but an archived biopsy of his kidney was positive for rabies virus RNA, confirming the organ as the source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan recipient died on the seventh day after hospitalization, but he may have saved other lives. The donor's heart and lungs were used for training at a Maryland research facility and did not pose a risk, but three other patients had received corneal grafts from the donor's corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors immediately removed the transplanted corneas and prescribed the patients a course of highly effective Post-exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP – human rabies antibodies plus a vaccine given before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials assessed 357 possible contacts of both the donor and the kidney recipient. In total, 46 people – including healthcare workers, community contacts, and the cornea recipients – were advised to receive PEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events highlights a vulnerability in the current donor system. While the donor's risk assessment interview documented the skunk scratch, his symptoms hadn't been recognized as consistent with rabies, so his skunk encounter wasn't raised as a testable rabies risk until after the kidney recipient had died as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since rabies testing on donor organs is not routine, and no one raised any red flags, the transplants took place as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies can take weeks to months to become symptomatic after transmission. The CDC advises significantly more caution with donors who have had a potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a potential donor, particularly one with acute &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"&gt;encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, had a bite or scratch from a rabies-susceptible animal during the preceding year, transplant teams should consider consulting public health officials to determine rabies risk," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;the organization writes in its report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If an organ or tissue has been transplanted from a donor who is subsequently suspected to have had rabies, a risk assessment could save lives by accelerating diagnostic testing, possible explantation when deemed clinically appropriate, and PEP administration to recipients and other contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see the CDC's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7439a1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The duvet is pulled neatly into place, the pillows are arranged with care, and the perfectly made bed becomes a symbol of order and discipline. Across generations, this simple act has been encouraged as a marker of responsibility, productivity, and self-control. From military training to parenting advice and bestselling self-help books, making the bed has been framed as a small but meaningful accomplishment that sets the tone for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, emerging research suggests that this universally accepted habit may be hiding an unexpected drawback. While it appears harmless and even beneficial, it could be creating conditions that quietly undermine your respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

With more people spending extended time at home, conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinus issues are increasingly being linked to pollutants and allergens inside the home. Bedrooms, where people spend roughly a third of their lives, are especially important in this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the traditional practice of making the bed every morning takes an unexpected turn. A growing body of scientific evidence highlights how tightly made bedding may be fostering an environment ideal for dust mite survival. A widely discussed study conducted at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/about/news/messy-bedroom-could-spell-end-for-creepy-crawlies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kingston University in the United Kingdom &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;revealed that leaving your bed unmade during the day could significantly reduce dust mite populations. Led by environmental building scientist Dr Stephen Pretlove, the research examined how heat and moisture trapped in bedding influence dust mite growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A freshly made bed traps the warmth and humidity generated during sleep. These conditions allow dust mites, which feed on dead skin cells, to thrive. When the bed is left unmade, with sheets exposed to airflow and natural evaporation, moisture levels fall and the microclimate becomes less favourable for mite survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Pretlove noted, allowing a bed to remain open during the day helps moisture evaporate from the mattress and bedding materials. This creates an environment that disrupts dust mite activity and reduces their ability to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why dust mites pose a serious health concern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dust mites are among the most common indoor allergens worldwide. Although invisible to the naked eye, their waste particles can trigger a variety of allergic reactions. Symptoms may range from mild nasal irritation and sneezing to more significant respiratory issues, particularly in people with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/dust-mites" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, bedding and pillows are some of the most concentrated sources of dust mite allergens in the home. An average bed may host up to 1.5 million mites, creating a continual source of allergen exposure night after night. Reducing dust mite levels is therefore crucial for households with asthma sufferers, young children, older adults, or individuals with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden link between bed-making habits and dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that a tidy bed equates to a cleaner sleeping environment. In reality, the opposite may be true. When you sleep, your body releases moisture through sweat and respiration. The average adult emits roughly one litre of fluid each night. If you immediately make the bed in the morning, this moisture becomes trapped under layers of sheets, blankets, and duvets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With limited ventilation, particularly during colder months when windows remain closed, this trapped moisture creates a warm and humid microclimate ideal for dust mite survival and reproduction. Indoor heating systems further complicate the issue by drying the air outside the bedding while leaving the inside warm and insulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies, including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasise the importance of reducing humidity and improving airflow to control indoor allergens. However, few people consider how their bed-making routine influences these environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bed-making tips that help control dust mite growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts do not suggest abandoning cleanliness or household routines. Instead, they recommend a more thoughtful approach to bed-making. Rather than immediately arranging your bedding after waking, allow the sheets and mattress to air out for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull back the duvet, open the windows if possible, and leave the bed exposed to moving air. This helps disperse moisture, lowers humidity, and reduces the hospitable environment that dust mites rely on. Of course, this practice should complement other hygienic habits such as washing bedding every one to two weeks in hot water, vacuuming the mattress regularly, and using dust-mite-resistant covers on pillows and mattresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing importance of indoor air quality in multi use bedrooms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern lifestyles have blurred the boundaries between living, working, and sleeping spaces. With more people using bedrooms for multiple activities, the quality of the indoor environment matters more than ever. Allowing your bed to breathe is a low-cost, practical step that can improve air quality and reduce allergen levels. It is not about rejecting cleanliness but about adapting an old habit to align with new scientific understanding. The tradition of making the bed every morning has been deeply ingrained for generations. Yet as research continues to highlight the importance of indoor air quality, small adjustments to this habit could have meaningful benefits for respiratory health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bed unmade for a few hours allows natural airflow to do what it does best. It dries the bedding, disrupts the activity of dust mites, and creates a healthier sleeping environment. By rethinking this everyday ritual, you may be reducing an invisible risk that has quietly affected millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPQlZEVkE0c20yNi1HS3FIS2JJVEY2Y0tPZWEtY2dpR1NhQ1FtS2xVTVQ4UGMzMWk4cVRpeWRiY2hha3htc1NiM0VoY2dyUGZyMmZ2ekQ4ajFEU3VTNEZINnh4SXEwcHdHZktuSmxqZE9kS2I3OUFKdHJEWndYVVdmemZITk1WUUpvck45V0M2dEg1akRxYm4tZUdhLUZsNW43cDhkRlpQOHFyLTRLYWlnMzdQSV83U3JvTkdBc0x5b2FHQlV6QlJqZGRTSmV0d1JvNF84c0w0MG4wSG9GR0U1N0RpaFk5aEZRR3lKb2t6NzNzdEh1UHJ2Y1BPcVVvMjVZQWZEakR3VldJbXBRam50TEUydWRJSno4eG5lMHBUYnVkZ9IBpwJBVV95cUxNd3BJTlhBY0s1SEF4SFBEQnNkUVNpclNLT3ZSM2tUY2NRVm4tN0lYWERKbk1tbEx0eDkxUUx4Y3llRURPdjlQaVR6T01kZ1RjajdQNGU1aWxsaTR0LUF1dzg4RW1IWVpLcVZ0ODJ2ajRlcDIzbldlTjZ3RktQT3hCejl1V0J5VkRkWjYzTnRnNlgzcVpTaU50NzBpdjBBMHhsalQtTnJIUjFPMzlFOTI4Skh0cldKN0N4SDFlZ3F4WTU2ckdEWjB5RmVacTFzYXljN1lyaG9hZThRczFFYXV4UWpYRFg3SU9ZeVNGZGdzOUhkTVdPU1NVNFRpTEh3eTVYSjZ3aWNySWNOT1hzOUhDWGVmRFFYc0RuRGo3dlAtMkc2eDJSd044</guid></item><item><title>人类是为大自然而生，而不是为现代生活而生- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251207031335.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A new analysis by evolutionary anthropologists Colin Shaw (University of Zurich) and Daniel Longman (Loughborough University) argues that the modern world has developed faster than human biology can adapt. Their work proposes that chronic stress and many widespread health concerns stem from a fundamental mismatch between our nature-shaped physiology and the highly industrialized environments most people live in today.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, humans evolved to meet the physical and psychological demands of hunter-gatherer life, which required frequent movement, short bursts of intense stress and daily exposure to natural settings. Industrialization has altered these conditions within only a few centuries by adding noise, air and light pollution, microplastics, pesticides, continuous sensory input, artificial lighting, processed foods and long periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our ancestral environments, we were well adapted to deal with acute stress to evade or confront predators," says Colin Shaw, who leads the Human Evolutionary EcoPhysiology (HEEP) research group with Daniel Longman. "The lion would come around occasionally, and you had to be ready to defend yourself -- or run. The key is that the lion goes away again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern stressors such as traffic, workplace pressure, social media and persistent noise activate the same biological pathways that once helped humans survive predators. Unlike the rapid resolution our ancestors experienced, these stressors rarely subside. "Our body reacts as though all these stressors were lions," Longman explains. "Whether it's a difficult discussion with your boss or traffic noise, your stress response system is still the same as if you were facing lion after lion. As a result, you have a very powerful response from your nervous system, but no recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrialization and Its Impact on Health and Reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their review, Shaw and Longman evaluate research suggesting that the shift toward industrial and urban living is reducing human evolutionary fitness. Evolutionary success depends on both survival and reproduction, and the authors argue that both have been negatively influenced since industrialization began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They highlight falling fertility rates across much of the world and increasing rates of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as evidence that modern environments are placing stress on human biology. "There's a paradox where, on the one hand, we've created tremendous wealth, comfort and healthcare for a lot of people on the planet," Shaw says, "but on the other hand, some of these industrial achievements are having detrimental effects on our immune, cognitive, physical and reproductive functions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most studied examples is the steady decline in sperm count and sperm motility observed since the 1950s. Shaw notes that these trends appear to be linked to environmental exposures. "This is believed to be tied to pesticides and herbicides in food, but also to microplastics," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for Solutions That Support Human Wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological and environmental conditions continue to change far more rapidly than biological evolution can respond to. "Biological adaptation is very slow. Longer-term genetic adaptations are multigenerational -- tens to hundreds of thousands of years," Shaw says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this means the mismatch between human physiology and modern living conditions will not correct itself through natural evolutionary processes. Instead, they argue that societies must take active steps to reduce these pressures by strengthening connections to nature and creating healthier, more sustainable environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing this mismatch requires both cultural and environmental changes. Shaw suggests treating nature as a crucial component of public health and protecting or restoring landscapes that resemble those in which humans originally evolved. He also advocates for rethinking city design to better align with human physiology and reduce harmful exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research can identify which stimuli most affect blood pressure, heart rate or immune function, for example, and pass that knowledge on to decision-makers," Shaw says. "We need to get our cities right -- and at the same time regenerate, value and spend more time in natural spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While medications, a healthy diet, and regular exercise are commonly recommended to manage blood pressure, recent research highlights the importance of sleep timing. Going to bed at the same time every night can help regulate the body’s internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, which controls sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. A consistent bedtime supports the natural nightly dip in blood pressure, reduces stress on the heart, and can even enhance the effectiveness of existing hypertension treatments. Maintaining this simple habit is an easy and low-cost strategy for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding blood pressure and why it matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries and is recorded as two numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diastolic pressure: Pressure in the arteries between heartbeats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure is considered below 120/80 mmHg. Readings above 130/80 mmHg indicate hypertension, and readings above 180/120 mmHg require urgent medical attention. Hypertension often develops without symptoms, making it essential to monitor regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of circadian rhythm in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian rhythm is the body’s internal clock, which regulates sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and organ function. Blood pressure naturally dips during sleep: a process called nocturnal dipping. Disruptions to sleep patterns, such as going to bed at inconsistent times, can interfere with this natural dip and contribute to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sustained high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of diabetes and obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher chances of heart attacks and strokes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a regular bedtime strengthens the circadian rhythm, helping the body regulate blood pressure more effectively. A study by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/6/4/zpaf082/8325210" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; monitored 11 middle-aged adults over one week on their usual sleep schedule and two weeks with a fixed bedtime.

Trying and failing at something, doing the bare minimum, or getting less done than you wanted to will almost never leave you in a worse position than if you didn't do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of clarity, this does not apply to anything where half assing it will likely injure yourself or someone else. Don't half ass electrical work, good lifting form, raising children, or hostage negotiations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SKIKS/" target="_blank"&gt;u/SKIKS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I tell people this all the time.

&lt;p&gt;Apple watches, Garmin watches, Fitbit watches, the Strava app … there are endless ways to track miles walked, calories burned, and steps taken. Not only that, but there’s been a big push to track those measures every time — and it may be hurting your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The obsession with self-tracking of health metrics with wearables can increase anxiety and cause you to ignore what your body is telling you,” said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/michael-swartzon/869766" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Swartzon&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine physician at Baptist Health Orthopedic Care. “The raw data can lead to emotional stress when your body is just going through normal biological variations, probably the opposite of your goal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://freespira.com/leadership_team/robert-cuyler-ph-d/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994495" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robert Cuyler&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral health expert, whether health tracking is “healthy” is about when and how much you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The availability of tech-mediated health data is interesting and useful for those who use these tools (smartwatches, rings, etc.) in moderation and for specific purposes, with some guidance by evidence,” he said. “However, health tracking ... can become excessive, fueling bodily hypervigilance and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Swartzon encouraged people to focus on the basics: fitting some physical exercise into their day, eating a wide variety of foods, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and listening to their body. All that other data isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Ashley, 35, told the outlet she made sure Tori got plenty of rest and continued to monitor her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Tori's fever broke after a few days, Ashley believed she was on the mend. "Then suddenly, she started complaining of intense pain in both legs," the mom recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pain began in Tori's thighs before moving down to her calves. As she was still recovering from the flu, Ashley assumed the leg pain was "just normal soreness" from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother taking a child's temperature (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But soon, the pain became so intense that Tori complained of being unable to stand, saying "her legs felt too weak to support her," Ashley told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She took Tori to a walk-in clinic, but doctors “didn’t seem concerned" and advised Ashley to take her daughter home and allow her to continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next morning, however, Tori attempted to get out of bed and "took one step and dropped straight to the ground because the pain was so unbearable when she put pressure on her feet," her mom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That was the moment I knew this was something serious,” Ashley recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Child in hospital (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashley took Tori to the emergency room, where she underwent testing, including bloodwork and a urinalysis. Tori was then diagnosed with benign acute childhood myositis (BACM), a rare disease that is "characterized by localized muscular pain (especially in the calves) that typically follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection," according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12454055/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The illness typically lasts for a brief period of time, usually up to 1 week," the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250949/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; said, noting, "Since many clinicians are unfamiliar with BACM, it is often misdiagnosed and interpreted as a more severe and complex disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Tori's case, the 9-year-old fully recovered — and was able to walk normally again — after a week in the hospital, where she was closely monitored and administered IV fluids and pain medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But her mom told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that her daughter's BACM diagnosis came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This completely caught me off guard," she said. "I had never even heard of this kind of complication from the flu before. It was scary and very unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, Ashley is warning other parents about the rare complication.

I'm sharing our story so other parents can know what to watch for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;, Ashley added, “Listen to your kids when they say something hurts, even if it seems unusual.

    &lt;p&gt;When people think of gym goers using steroids, the picture that comes to mind is often of a man &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"&gt;pumping iron, like Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, or modern day shirtless masculinity &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/from-the-liver-king-to-ultramarathons-fitness-influencers-are-glorifying-extreme-masculinity-where-pain-is-the-point-256817"&gt;influencers like “the Liver King”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the image is changing. Women now represent a growing share of people who use steroids. And so harm minimisation efforts, currently targeted at men, will need to change too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DL3GLMAxuMG","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows women are increasingly represented among steroid-using communities, even though precise long-term trend data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;2024 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of international studies found about 4% of adult women had used anabolic steroids at least once, up from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.01.009"&gt;1.6% in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2024/08/28/risks-faced-by-women-using-anabolic-steroids-in-australia"&gt;Among women bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 17% – around one in six – report using steroids, and rates among women in strength sports or recreational lifting communities are also markedly higher than in the general woman population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging evidence suggests the gender profile of steroid use is shifting, even if precise historical rates are not available to confirm the exact scale of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we don’t have robust national statistics for Australia, data show &lt;a href="https://www.acic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-10/illicit_drug_data_report_2020-21_forweb.pdf"&gt;the weight of steroids seized nationally&lt;/a&gt; increased 1,372% between 2011-12 and 2020-21 (from 33.7 kilograms to 496.8kg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend almost &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16643"&gt;certainly mirrors what’s happening overseas&lt;/a&gt;: continued, escalating growth of the bodybuilding and fitness communities, including among women in amateur strength sports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boom in women’s &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-03/women-weightlifting-no-longer-invisible-empowering-women-all-age/105945008"&gt;strength training and weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; since 2021 will benefit the physical and mental health of most who partake in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the simultaneous increase in steroid use may be cause for concern without effective harm reduction via education, health promotion and health services engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="TiktokEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@larrywheels/video/7389447108404776234"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3 reasons more women are using them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex but three stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/physical-activity/strengthening-activities-among-australian-adults/contents/summary"&gt;the rise of strength sports&lt;/a&gt;. Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666337625000162"&gt;participation in powerlifting, weightlifting and bodybuilding has grown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/women-strength-training-shredded-at-gym-for-health/103376798"&gt;rapidly in Australia &lt;/a&gt;since the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sports have opened up new spaces for women to feel strong, confident and physically capable. But they also expose women to online communities where performance-enhancing drugs are normalised.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Second, the influence of social media. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are filled with “fitfluencers” showcasing dramatic transformations. Many of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;women are seeking the “perfect body”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some openly promote steroid cycles and other chemical shortcuts. Women who follow these influencers – often for training or nutrition advice – can end up in online spaces where performance-enhancing drugs are normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Third, many women are being encouraged or “brought into” performance-enhancing drugs use by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research from Australia and Scandinavia shows women often start using steroids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395920302164?via%3Dihub"&gt;through male friends, partners or coaches&lt;/a&gt;, who may position these drugs as necessary for progress or competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, taking any performance- or image-enhancing drug is not without risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The dangers are real&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While steroids carry risks for everyone, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6371806/"&gt;women may face unique and irreversible side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102876"&gt;These include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facial and body hair growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deepening of the voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;menstrual changes or infertility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breast tissue reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acne and hair loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clitoral enlargement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;severe mood changes, including anxiety and irritability, among other symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beyond these risks, emerging Australian research shows another danger: many underground steroid products &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/pumped-up-with-poison-new-research-shows-many-anabolic-steroids-contain-toxic-metals-261470"&gt;contain toxic contaminants&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.70007"&gt;such as lead, arsenic and cadmium&lt;/a&gt; – substances linked to cancer, organ damage and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest long-term risks are the ones people rarely talk about: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6797160/"&gt;heart disease, stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2025.2460986"&gt;liver damage&lt;/a&gt; and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with women who use steroids show many are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0091450924125600"&gt;less informed than men about these dangers&lt;/a&gt;, often because the research has historically focused on male use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of stigma. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;Women report&lt;/a&gt; being judged more harshly than men when seeking medical help and some avoid health services entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves them more vulnerable to complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do we turn this trend around?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policing steroid use in isolation won’t work. Nor will repeating the old message that women should simply “just say no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests three promising approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.656413"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better health promotion education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that actually speaks to women. Most steroid information online is written for men, by men. Health agencies need to produce clear, accessible, women’s resources &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci9040055"&gt;that explain risks honestly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509241249292"&gt;without shame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/28355245.2024.2350155"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Meeting women where they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Social media is where many women learn about these drugs, so it should also be where they see accurate information. This may include partnering with credible fitness influencers – especially women – who can explain risks, promote safer training practices and counter misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reducing stigma in healthcare.&lt;/strong&gt; Women who use steroids may avoid doctors because they fear judgement. Training clinicians to respond without moralising – the same way we approach other drug-related issues – would make it easier for women to seek support early.&lt;/p&gt;

These traditional methods, although widely used, can cause minor pain, skin irritation, or bruising, and their frequency can reduce adherence. Advances in optical sensing technologies are now offering alternatives that allow you to monitor glucose continuously without breaking the skin. One particularly promising technique is band-pass Raman spectroscopy, which captures the unique vibrational signatures of glucose molecules in the skin and underlying tissue. By translating these molecular fingerprints into continuous readings, this approach could improve accuracy, reduce discomfort, and offer detailed insights into daily glucose fluctuations, allowing you to manage your health more precisely. The method also has the potential to integrate into compact, wearable devices, offering convenience while maintaining clinical reliability and patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How band-pass Raman spectroscopy detects glucose in your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Band-pass Raman spectroscopy relies on the interaction of light with molecules to identify glucose in the skin and tissue. When a focused laser beam illuminates the skin, most photons scatter without change, but a small fraction interacts with molecules, causing a shift in energy that produces a Raman spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each type of molecule has a distinctive spectral signature, and glucose produces identifiable peaks that can be isolated from signals of proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules. Band-pass optical filters allow the device to focus on the spectral range where glucose signals are strongest, reducing background interference. These signals are then analysed by advanced computational algorithms, which convert the spectral information into glucose concentrations continuously. Because the technique is non-invasive, it allows repeated measurements without puncturing the skin, providing consistent monitoring throughout the day. The approach also lends itself to compact, portable designs, making it suitable for wearable devices that integrate seamlessly into your lifestyle while providing clinically relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What research says about painless, continuous glucose tracking&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c01146" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Analytical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the feasibility of using band-pass Raman spectroscopy for continuous glucose monitoring with a compact, point-of-care device. Researchers demonstrated that the system could reliably detect glucose concentrations with accuracy comparable to standard finger-prick methods. The study highlighted the importance of device calibration, signal processing, and precise optical alignment to ensure reliable readings. The compact design was particularly suitable for use both in clinical settings and in home environments, enabling continuous monitoring without the discomfort of repeated blood sampling. Findings indicated that non-invasive monitoring could reduce both the physical and psychological burden of conventional methods while providing a more comprehensive understanding of glucose dynamics. Continuous monitoring allows identification of trends that might otherwise be missed with intermittent sampling, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits of tracking blood sugar without needles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive glucose monitoring offers clear advantages compared with traditional sampling. Eliminating repeated skin punctures reduces pain, bruising, and the risk of infection. Continuous data provide a dynamic view of glucose fluctuations, allowing you to respond quickly to rising or falling levels. Integration with wearable devices enables real-time data transmission to smartphones or healthcare providers, supporting remote monitoring and personalised care. Because measurements are automated, the method reduces errors associated with sample handling, timing, or technique, improving overall reliability. The approach also allows for long-term tracking, giving both patients and clinicians a richer dataset for informed decision-making regarding diet, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key advantages include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of finger-prick testing and associated discomfort or skin irritation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time continuous monitoring of glucose fluctuations throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced risk of skin infections or minor injuries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with wearable technology for remote data collection and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved adherence due to convenience and ease of use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced errors from manual sampling and handling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential for automated alerts and personalised intervention strategies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced long-term tracking for more informed healthcare decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What challenges still stands in the way of needle-free glucose monitoring&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its promise, band-pass Raman spectroscopy faces several challenges before it can be widely implemented. Variations in skin pigmentation, tissue composition, and ambient environmental conditions can affect the Raman signal, necessitating careful calibration for each individual user. Signal processing must effectively separate glucose peaks from background noise, requiring sophisticated algorithms and extensive validation. Device design also needs to balance compactness, comfort, battery life, and reliable wireless connectivity for continuous wear. Researchers are exploring hybrid systems that combine Raman spectroscopy with complementary sensing methods to improve accuracy and robustness. Ensuring consistent performance across different environments and user conditions remains a critical step. Overcoming these challenges is essential to translating laboratory prototypes into practical, everyday tools suitable for clinical use and long-term patient monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Main challenges include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variability in skin tone, tissue composition, and optical properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interference from ambient light, background fluorescence, or environmental factors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requirement for individual calibration to maintain accurate readings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex signal processing to isolate glucose signals reliably&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Device ergonomics and comfort for continuous wear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring consistent performance across different conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with secure wireless transmission and long-lasting battery solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of hybrid systems to improve accuracy and robustness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

								&lt;p&gt;SANTA FE, N.M. — A hiker in the Gila National Forest was bitten by a coyote that tested positive for rabies, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker didn’t require hospitalization. However, they are receiving “routine treatment” to prevent a rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH conducted testing that confirmed the diagnosis. They stated they have seen three other cases of rabid animals in southwest New Mexico this year — a bobcat in Sierra County, a coyote in Catron County and a dog in Grant Country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is preventable, but only if we take it seriously,” said Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH. “The best way to protect your family — including your pets — is to make sure your animals are vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH recommends the following to stay safe from rabies: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on vaccinations and ensure they wear current license tags.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, call your veterinarian for a rabies booster, even if the wound is superficial.    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an animal bites you, wash the area immediately and thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention promptly.     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate horses and other household pets, even if they remain exclusively on your property. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any exposure or bite to your local animal control and call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833 796-8773).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The research indicates that this condition, known as cognitive disengagement syndrome, presents a unique set of challenges that shift as children mature into adolescents. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251344719" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive disengagement syndrome is a condition characterized by a specific pattern of mental functioning. Individuals with this syndrome often exhibit excessive daydreaming, frequent mental confusion, and a general slowing of thinking or behavior. These behaviors were historically described as “sluggish cognitive tempo” in older medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and researchers have debated how to best categorize these symptoms for years. The primary question has been whether these behaviors represent a subset of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or if they constitute a standalone clinical syndrome. Clarifying this distinction is necessary for ensuring that children receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has largely focused on validating the list of fifteen symptoms associated with cognitive disengagement syndrome. Studies conducted in countries such as Brazil, South Korea, and the United States have supported the idea that these symptoms are structurally different from the inattention associated with attention deficits. Structural validity indicates that the symptoms group together reliably and are mathematically distinct from other attention problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the current study aimed to take this understanding a step further by examining clinical categories. They sought to determine if they could identify groups of youth who met the criteria for cognitive disengagement syndrome but did not meet the criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also investigated whether the emotional and social difficulties associated with these conditions change between childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a team of international experts in child psychopathology. G. Leonard Burns of Washington State University and Stephen P. Becker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center led the investigation. They collaborated with Juan José Montaño, Belén Sáez, and Mateu Servera from the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators utilized a nationally representative sample of families residing in Spain to gather their data. They recruited participants through an online platform to ensure a broad demographic reach across the country’s various regions. The final sample consisted of parents reporting on 5,525 children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants ranged in age from 5 to 16 years. To analyze developmental differences, the researchers divided the youth into a childhood group (ages 5 to 10) and an adolescence group (ages 11 to 16). Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Behavior Inventory to rate the frequency of specific behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inventory assessed symptoms related to cognitive disengagement, inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. It also measured functional impairments such as academic struggles, social difficulties, and sleep problems. The researchers used statistical thresholds to create specific clinical groups based on the parents’ ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified children who scored in the clinical range for cognitive disengagement syndrome only. They also identified those who scored in the clinical range for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder only. The latter group was further broken down into three presentations: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first major finding concerned the independence of the two conditions. The data showed that a distinct group of youth exhibited high levels of cognitive disengagement without significant symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This independence was observed in both the childhood and adolescent age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that approximately 2.5 percent of children and 1.5 percent of adolescents in the general population fit the “cognitive disengagement syndrome only” profile. This confirms that the syndrome can exist as a solo clinical entity. However, the study also provided detailed statistics on how often the conditions overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the childhood group, about half of the youth with cognitive disengagement syndrome did not qualify for a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This rate of independence decreased slightly as the children got older. In the adolescent group, roughly one-third of those with cognitive disengagement syndrome did not have a co-occurring attention disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study then examined how these groups differed in terms of emotional and behavioral problems. In the childhood group, those with cognitive disengagement syndrome displayed a significantly higher risk for internalizing disorders. They scored higher on measures of anxiety and depression compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children also exhibited higher rates of somatization. This refers to the expression of psychological distress through physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. This tendency toward physical complaints was more pronounced in the cognitive disengagement group than in any of the attention-deficit groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern of findings shifted noticeably when the researchers analyzed the adolescent group. The gap in anxiety and depression scores between the conditions largely disappeared. Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder reported levels of anxiety and depression that were similar to those with cognitive disengagement syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This convergence suggests different developmental pathways for these disorders. It is possible that depression in cognitive disengagement syndrome is a consistent feature that begins early. Conversely, depression in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may develop later as a reaction to years of academic and social struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep difficulties emerged as a strong and consistent differentiator between the groups. Across both childhood and adolescence, youth with cognitive disengagement syndrome experienced more daytime sleep-related impairment. They were more likely to appear drowsy, lethargic, or tired during the day than their peers with attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nighttime sleep disturbances were also more common in the cognitive disengagement group. This includes trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. While this difference was clear in childhood, the distinction became less consistent in adolescence regarding comparisons with the hyperactive-impulsive group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed social functioning, which revealed nuanced differences. In childhood, the cognitive disengagement group showed higher levels of social withdrawal. These children were more likely to isolate themselves from peer interactions compared to those with attention deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, peer rejection presented a different dynamic. Children with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder often experience active rejection by peers. The study found that while cognitive disengagement children withdraw, they do not necessarily face the same level of active rejection as hyperactive children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adolescence, the differences in social impairment leveled off. The cognitive disengagement group and the attention-deficit groups showed similar levels of social difficulties. This indicates that while the specific nature of the social problems might differ, the overall impact on social life becomes comparable in the teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic impairment provided one of the clearest distinctions between the conditions. In the adolescent sample, the attention-deficit groups showed significantly greater academic struggles. The combined presentation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was associated with the highest levels of school-related difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents with cognitive disengagement syndrome fared better academically than those with attention deficits. This suggests that the symptoms of daydreaming and mental confusion may be less detrimental to school grades than the symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. This finding aligns with previous research suggesting different functional outcomes for the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at oppositional defiant disorder, which involves a pattern of angry or argumentative behavior. In the adolescent group, those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed significantly higher levels of oppositional behavior. The cognitive disengagement group had lower rates of these disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that externalizing behaviors, such as defiance and aggression, are not central features of cognitive disengagement syndrome. The syndrome appears to be more closely improved with internal distress and withdrawal. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, particularly the combined and hyperactive types, is more strongly linked to outward behavioral conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted several limitations to their study that context is required to interpret the results. The data relied solely on ratings provided by mothers and fathers. The study did not include information from teachers, who often see different behaviors in the classroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study did not include self-reports from the adolescents themselves. Teenagers often have unique insights into their own internal emotional states, particularly regarding anxiety and depression. Future research would benefit from incorporating multiple perspectives to build a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design was cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. This means the researchers looked at different children at different ages at a single point in time. They did not track the same individual children as they grew from age 5 to age 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this design, the suggestions regarding developmental pathways are hypotheses rather than confirmed timelines. Longitudinal research is needed to verify whether children with attention deficits actually develop depression later in life as a result of their struggles. Tracking individuals over time would clarify the cause-and-effect relationships suggested by this data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also emphasized the need to replicate these findings in other cultural contexts. While this study confirms findings from the United States using a Spanish sample, further global research is necessary. Differences in school systems and cultural expectations could influence how these symptoms present and impact functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the study provides strong evidence for the validity of cognitive disengagement syndrome. It reinforces the idea that clinicians should assess for these symptoms separately from attention deficits. Recognizing the unique profile of this syndrome could lead to more targeted and effective interventions for struggling youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251344719" target="_blank"&gt;Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome is Clinically Distinct from ADHD Presentations within Childhood and Adolescence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by G.

As a result, they can push LDL cholesterol far below levels that most people reach with statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28304224/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FOURIER&lt;/a&gt; outcomes trial showed that adding evolocumab to statins dropped LDL to about 30 milligrams per deciliter and reduced major cardiovascular events in high risk patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That result raised a sharp question about whether the benefit came only from changing blood numbers or also from reshaping plaque inside the artery wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering that question meant looking directly at the plaques instead of guessing from cholesterol tests. New invasive imaging tools made it possible to watch plaque in the same artery segment change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intravascular-cameras"&gt;Intravascular cameras&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New tools such as intravascular ultrasound, a catheter based ultrasound that images artery walls from inside, let cardiologists measure plaque volume rather than just the open channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same catheter run can be repeated months later, giving matching before and after pictures of the very same vessel segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light based optical coherence tomography, a high resolution imaging method using reflected light, can see the thin fibrous layer that covers the soft core of a plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can measure how thick that cap is, which matters because very thin caps are more likely to tear and release clot forming material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared spectroscopy (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/near-infrared-spectroscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIS&lt;/a&gt;) uses infrared light absorption patterns to map how much oily lipid sits inside plaque cores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with ultrasound or optical imaging, it helps identify plaques that are especially rich in lipid and therefore more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these invasive cameras give several complementary views of the same disease. One measures size, another shows structure, and a third highlights the chemical makeup inside the plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pcsk9-and-dangerous-plaques"&gt;PCSK9 and dangerous plaques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27846344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLAGOV&lt;/a&gt; trial, nearly one thousand statin treated patients had coronary plaque measured from inside the artery using intravascular ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding evolocumab produced a clear drop in the percentage of the artery wall filled with plaque, and more than half of the patients showed actual regression of plaque volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35431172/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; called HUYGENS used optical coherence tomography and ultrasound in patients who had a type of heart attack called non ST elevation myocardial infarction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolocumab on top of statins made the protective cap thicker and reduced the arc of lipid inside plaques compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35368058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PACMAN-AMI&lt;/a&gt; trial tested the PCSK9 blocker alirocumab in three hundred patients after an acute myocardial infarction, a sudden blockage of a heart artery that kills muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial imaging showed that alirocumab plus high intensity statin therapy shrank plaque burden, reduced lipid rich core, and increased cap thickness in arteries that had not caused the original heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people born with very high cholesterol, a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disorder that causes lifelong high LDL, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37009731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ARCHITECT&lt;/a&gt; trial followed more than one hundred patients on alirocumab and strong statins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over roughly a year and a half, overall plaque burden in the coronary tree fell, and the unstable fibrofatty and necrotic core portion shrank while more stable fibrous and calcified tissue increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-plaque-changes-matter"&gt;Why the plaque changes matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists watch features such as a large lipid core, a very thin fibrous cap, a scar-like tissue layer over plaque, and high inflammation because they signal a plaque that can rupture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These risky plaques may sit in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-linked-to-risk-of-stroke-and-heart-attack/"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt; that look only mildly narrowed on standard angiograms, yet they are often the ones that break and trigger clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging trials now suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors shift plaques away from this high risk pattern toward a quieter, more stable state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these studies, plaques tended to become smaller, more fibrous, less packed with free cholesterol, and better covered by thicker caps that are less likely to split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts in plaque features match what doctors expect when LDL is driven very low for long periods. The imaging results link changes in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-blood-test-detects-cancer-before-symptoms-appear/"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; to physical changes in plaque, which makes the clinical benefits of intensive treatment easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the imaging work follows the same patients over time, it connects LDL reductions with direct evidence of plaque healing in those arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That picture helps explain why treating aggressively, sometimes within days after a heart attack, can change long term risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-artery-imaging"&gt;Lessons from artery imaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies encourage a move from caring only about how narrow an artery looks to caring about what kind of plaque is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modest narrowing made mostly of soft lipid with a thin cap can be more dangerous than a tighter narrowing built from tough fibrous and calcified tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing whether noninvasive scans guided by plaque features, such as low density regions or changes in surrounding fat, can flag people who most need aggressive LDL lowering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that strategy proves reliable, doctors might one day tailor PCSK9 therapy not just to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; numbers, but also to the hidden biology of each patient’s plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, PCSK9 inhibitors remain costly and are usually reserved for people at very high risk who do not reach LDL targets with other treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging could help make those decisions more precise by identifying patients whose plaque still looks dangerous despite apparently good standard therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing trials are exploring how early and how intensively to use these drugs after a heart attack, and whether imaging endpoints should help steer future guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more data emerge, artery cameras may play a growing role in showing when plaque has truly calmed and when more treatment is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11393034/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Atherosclerosis Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 19:06:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNMTNMY3ExTnlBNFdiLWl6MTg0bXVXX0tzVWR5Ukk2YW51RHhFRWhOUndPaVE2c0FfcUs5WHZWc0RVbEZhQXBwVG45MWQzVEFZMmdBSkdGc0JfdlEtV3N1dE0zQ0lXTTF2VzJMWWJINDdkeG5nSXQ0V1A3VWdCQm9aMlJkR2F6R1BEVTVHd0ZzYi1DSFAxbFF0NVpMVDA5SkhUR004REo5elZnWFpqQ1VpNjRnaFRiVk1jUXZ3ZEFn</guid></item><item><title>“Scromiting”是一种与慢性大麻使用有关的奇怪疾病，正在上升- East Idaho News</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/12/scromiting-a-bizarre-condition-linked-to-chronic-marijuana-use-is-on-the-rise/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(CNN) — It was a pain worse than childbirth, said a TikTok mom as she described bouts of uncontrollable vomiting after marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was crying and screaming and I was like ‘I can’t take this anymore!’ I hate my life,” she said. “I’m just begging God, like please make it stop!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dubbed “scromiting” by social media due to the combination of screaming and loud vomiting, the medical name for the condition is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS, which is on the rise in the United States. Habitual users of cannabis, including teenagers, are showing up in emergency rooms complaining of severe intestinal distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They are writhing, holding their stomach, complaining of really bad abdominal pain and nausea,” said Dr. Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, who treats adolescents with the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They vomit and then just continue to vomit whatever they have in their stomach, which can go on for hours,” Wang told CNN in a prior interview. “They often say they took a scalding hot shower before they came to the ER but it didn’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immediate treatment consists of anti-nausea medications and IV fluids to combat dehydration from the vomiting. But patients also undergo a battery of tests to rule out other causes: blood and urine tests, expensive CT scans, unpleasant upper GI endoscopy and gastric emptying tests, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some adolescents, those tests could be repeated again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some of our kids, this is their fifth ER visit in the past two months, with symptoms that they can’t control,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if they wait too long to come in, the condition can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regardless of whether it’s cannabis hyperemesis syndrome or another virus that makes you vomit a lot,” Wang said, “if you let it go too long, you can have electrolyte disturbances, go into shock and have organ failure. CHS is no different.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bizarre condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome burst upon the medical scene in 2004, when a group of Australian researchers wrote about 19 chronic marijuana users who had repeated episodes of abdominal pain and retching. The researchers followed nine of the patients over time and found symptoms went away when cannabis use was stopped but returned when it was restarted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly, over half of the 19 reported using extremely hot baths or showers to self-treat their symptoms. As more and more cases of CHS began to appear, hot bathing as a home treatment became a recurring theme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty universal for these patients to say they need a really, really hot shower, or a really hot bath, to improve their symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why hot? “That’s not entirely clear,” said Wang, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive compound in weed, has access to the body’s pain receptors, so one theory is that the distracting sensation of the extreme heat interrupts the pain cycle, thus easing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To compound the strangeness of the disorder, THC and other cannabinoids in the marijuana plant have been used for pain relief — paradoxically relieving nausea and vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, despite the popularity of marijuana as a painkiller, study results on its effectiveness have been mixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, why would the same compound relieve and also cause pain? Among a myriad of possibilities: dosage levels. Wang points to the ever increasing potency of THC in today’s marijuana products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s been well documented that the amount of THC that now comes in cannabis is increasing substantially,” Wang said. “In the ’90s the average was like 4% or 5%. Now in Colorado, it’s anywhere from 15% to 20%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another mystery: Not all heavy users of weed are affected by CHS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not entirely clear who is predisposed to getting it,” Wang said. “Is it a certain frequency or duration of use? Is it a specific potency? Or is it a specific type of product? We don’t have that data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHS is on the rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data show CHS is a national problem. Between 2005 and 2014 when only medical marijuana was legal in most states, a 2020 study found nearly 1 in 5 people hospitalized for cyclical vomiting in the United States reported concurrent cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, Wang and his colleagues found over 800,000 cases of reported vomiting due to cannabis in Colorado between 2013 and 2018. That’s about a 29% increase since legalization, Wang said. The study, published in September 2021, found the rate was highest in counties with no prior marijuana dispensaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A newer study, published in July 2025, found emergency room visits for adolescents aged 13 to 21 years across the nation increased more than 10-fold between 2016 and 2023. Yet another November 2025 study found the rate of CHS among adults 18 to 35 rose sharply during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 and remained high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, all of these studies have been limited by the lack of a medical diagnosis or insurance billing code to enable objective tracking of CHS. To do the studies, researchers had to compare medical records of vomiting with documented or self-reported cases of marijuana use — data that many people decline to provide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s changed. On October 1, 2025, a US federal committee created R11.16, an official medical diagnosis code for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. The World Health Organization did the same, allowing researchers worldwide to better track the condition. Experts say future studies will be more accurate, allowing researchers to shed more light onto this unusual condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNbzI4d2c2YUpQQnNtMzBGVUpfWlNVb0JHYXhYY2RTRXloM1FQcFBHMTBibTNuMFE0NE0zVU9PWVhHT1hPaDhKeGtKSFF2MWQ4VzRaa1p5aHNZTy1xWEZzTFJBTlBObFRUTDBDZlc4dUxQU2FwRmw0SHhjQy13djFCQXh4amR2TDBRMV9oSHBWenhiMEVjVGowSG43UHZrNkpHR0hPY3pVSndKTEhfQVFrMmRCZHVEc1E</guid></item><item><title>核辐射实际上对您的身体有什么影响？ - bgr.com</title><link>https://www.bgr.com/2040801/what-nuclear-radiation-does-body-explained/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

The world understood this in horrifying detail after the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disasters. In each case, people were not simply exposed to radiation, the nuclear radiation rewrote what was happening in their bodies. Bone marrow was affected, thyroid glands absorbed radioactive iodine, and cells mutated quietly over the years after the exposure. Some victims collapsed in a matter of days, others suffered for decades. Scientists have even seen signs of &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/the-dogs-of-chernobyl-may-be-evolving-right-before-our-eyes/" target="_blank"&gt;dogs around Chernobyl mutating and evolving&lt;/a&gt; faster. Nuclear radiation doesn't necessarily announce itself with flames or a loud bang. It works silently and invisibly from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Through years of hard work and experimentation, scientists learned a great deal about radiation. We now understand how it travels through food, which organs it attacks first, and why children can be more vulnerable. Although medicine has advanced, emergency systems have improved, and treatments have become smarter, we still don't know everything there is to know about how nuclear radiation affects human bodies. Nonetheless, here's what we do know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

When radiation enters the body, it interacts with the cells violently. This process is known as ionization. It knocks electrons loose and destabilizes the chemistry of life. DNA strands can snap, proteins lose their shape, and healthy cells suddenly become broken factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First to suffer are systems where cells divide fastest. Children are most affected because their growing bodies divide cells at faster rates than adults. Bone marrow may stop producing white cells, leading to infections, hemophilia, and excessive fatigue. The lining of the gut can peel away, causing to violent vomiting and dehydration. Skin exposed to high doses of radiation blisters and dies as if it were severely burned. Within weeks, the exposed person can lose their hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some radioactive particles don't just pass through our bodies. If radioactive dust is inhaled or swallowed, it often settles in the lungs, bones, or thyroid. Cesium, for example, mimics potassium and spreads through soft tissue. Strontium behaves like calcium and embeds itself in bones. Once inside, these particles can continue irradiating the human body for months and even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;High doses and sudden exposure can lead to the quick development of radiation poisoning. Confusion, nausea, weakness, and collapse are the first symptoms. Although lower exposure may seem harmless, if it's constant or over a prolonged period of time, it may cause cancer. That's why scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/scientific-breakthrough-could-make-x-ray-scans-safer-by-reducing-radiation/" target="_blank"&gt;working to make X-ray scans safer&lt;/a&gt; and reduce the amount of radiation we're exposed to over our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

Disasters like Chernobyl, Fukushima, Three Mile Island, and other &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-the-most-contaminated-nuclear-location-in-america/" target="_blank"&gt;contaminated nuclear locations&lt;/a&gt; taught the world that nuclear radiation doesn't behave in neat, predictable ways. Once it escapes into the environment, it's devastating. Radioactive iodine was found in milk days after Chernobyl. Ocean currents carried Fukushima contamination across the Pacific. Radiation doesn't fade like smoke. It lingers, seeps, and settles. It caused many towns to be erased from maps because the area remains unsafe for human life for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Medicine used these accidents to learn what the human body can survive, and what it cannot. Doctors now understand radiation burns, radiation sickness, and bone-marrow failure far better than before. The link between radiation and thyroid cancer became undeniable after thousands of cases appeared in exposed children in Ukraine. Since then, protective medicine such as potassium iodide became a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite everything we learned, some mysteries remain. Scientists still can't precisely predict who will develop cancer after low-level exposure and who will not. Two people can receive the same doses of radiation and face completely different futures. The effects of long-term exposure to small doses remain deeply uncertain. We know radiation damages DNA, but what we don't know is how often the repairs of damaged DNA fail. We also cannot predict when and if a damaged cell will turn into a cancerous one, because radiation alone is not the only mechanism behind tumors. Accidents such as Chernobyl give us data, but not nearly enough to completely understand the dangers of nuclear radiation to human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We may have been overestimating the role of a pathological class of misfolded protein in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called prions, these molecules are responsible for conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-mad-cow-disease-emerges-in-the-us"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; or 'mad cow disease', &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-deer-disease-zoonotic-transfer-suspected-after-two-human-deaths"&gt;chronic wasting disease&lt;/a&gt; in deer, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/infectious-deadly-prions-in-people-s-eyes-could-be-a-biohazard-scientists-warn"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt; in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in mice has found that some of the hallmarks of prion disease in brain tissue – such as the appearance of sponge-like holes, scarring, and accumulation of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; – can develop even in the complete absence of prions in their infectious configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/misfolded-proteins-could-make-dementia-transmissible-scientists-suggest"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misfolded Proteins Could Make Dementia Transmissible, Scientists Suggest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the study found that non-infectious prion precursors in the presence of chronic inflammation driven by a bacterial endotoxin were enough to trigger prion-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests we have overlooked some of the mechanisms that contribute to prion diseases, and in some cases, even mistaken the underlying cause. It also has implications for prion-like conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="183897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and ALS, in which misfolded proteins are central to irreversible brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183907" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183907" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/spongiform-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183907" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Spongiform encephalopathy under the microscope. (UCSF/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases –  found in humans – are the terrifying result of a normal biological process going randomly awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins consist of sequences of amino acids precisely folded to perform specific functions. They don't always work quite as intended, though; cells make wonky, misfolded, non-functional proteins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40035-017-0077-5"&gt;all the time&lt;/a&gt;. Your body is also pretty good at unfolding or destroying the wonky proteins when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On extremely rare occasions, however, some types of misfolded protein can become a prion. Not only do they not function as they should, but these oddly-shaped proteins also force other proteins to adopt the same misfolded shape. Worse still, they resist the body's protease clean-up mechanisms, allowing them to accumulate and destroy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a cog with a bent tooth; every cog it interlocks with also ends up with a bent tooth, which it then passes on to its adjacent cogs, and so on. The result is an unstoppable spread of dysfunction. What makes it even more horrifying is that prions are, by definition, infectious; they can be spread between individuals, most commonly by consuming prion-contaminated meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins that can turn into prions are called prion proteins, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_prion_protein"&gt;PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A misfolded PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; doesn't have to become a prion – that's a very specific, infectious type of misfolding – but recent evidence suggests that the other, non-infectious ways PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; can misfold may also trigger neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other emerging evidence suggests that a bacterial endotoxin called lipopolysaccharide (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"&gt;LPS&lt;/a&gt;), found on the outer membranes of some bacteria, can accelerate prion disease by inducing protease resistance in prion proteins. It also activates the host immune system's inflammatory response, further contributing to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by immunologist Burim Ametaj of the University of Alberta in Canada, a team of researchers used transgenic mice to determine the contribution of misfolded, non-infectious PrP and chronic inflammation to prion-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-human-prion-created-in-a-lab-neurodegenerative-disease"&gt;artificially generated&lt;/a&gt; a misfolded form of a PrP that is toxic to neurons without being infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they divided their study mice into six groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first group was given only saline – that was the control group. The second group was administered LPS, and the third group the toxic, misfolded, non-infectious PrP. The fourth group received both. The fifth group received actual infectious prions, and the sixth group received prions and LPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183913" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183913" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/prion-spread-600x464.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183913" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This 2011 photomicrograph shows how prions, colored red, spread between mouse neural tissue cells. (&lt;a href="https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=18131"&gt;NIAID&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the researchers carefully monitored and tested their mice for up to 750 days, studying their brains for spongiform changes, protease resistance, a type of brain scarring called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"&gt;astrogliosis&lt;/a&gt;, and amyloid plaques – all of which are associated with prion disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group that was given just the misfolded, non-infectious PrP alone developed the spongiform brain damage and scarring, but not the protease-resistant PrP that defines infectious prions. Meanwhile, the LPS-only group developed amyloid plaques, spongiform damage, and a high 40 percent mortality rate – but again, no protease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining LPS with the non-infectious PrP misfold did not increase lethality, but holes in the brains of mice in this group did grow larger. Finally, combining the prion with LPS dramatically accelerated the course of the disease. All of the mice in this group died within 200 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This fundamentally challenges the prevailing theory that these types of brain diseases are only about prions or similar misfolded proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2025/12/u-of-a-led-research-suggests-new-culprit-in-mad-cow-disease.html"&gt;Ametaj says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that, in at least some prion diseases, the host may first be weakened by inflammation before the protein misfolding that leads to prion formation – that prion disease may not actually start with prions, but with inflammation, or the non-infectious, misfolded PrP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's-like presentation of the mice administered only with LPS has some interesting implications. It suggests that inflammation may play a key role in kicking off neurodegenerative, prion-like diseases – echoing other recent studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-reveal-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;that have found links&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-yet-again"&gt;inflammation and Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It opens up an entire anti-inflammatory medicine toolkit. Bacterial endotoxins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-024-00722-y"&gt;have been found&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, so risk factors that reduce dementia – exercise, anti-inflammatory diets, gut health, metabolic health – might work partly by reducing endotoxin burden," &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2025/12/u-of-a-led-research-suggests-new-culprit-in-mad-cow-disease.html"&gt;Ametaj says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These diseases are complex, but if endotoxin exposure contributes to even 20 to 30 per cent of cases, controlling this modifiable risk factor could spare millions of people. We might prevent some neurodegenerative diseases the way we prevent heart disease, by managing inflammatory risk factors throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a field where there's been little hope, that matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136245"&gt;&lt;i&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These encouraging results come from a study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, which is taken as a tablet, works in a completely different way from well-known GLP-1-based medications such as Ozempic that are given through injections. GLP-1 drugs influence hunger by altering communication between the gut and the brain, and they can cause side effects that include appetite loss, decreased muscle mass, and gastrointestinal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Muscle Metabolism Rather Than Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of acting on hunger pathways, the new compound boosts metabolic activity directly within skeletal muscle. In animal studies, it improved blood sugar levels and body composition while avoiding the drawbacks commonly linked to today's GLP-1-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase I clinical trial involving 48 healthy volunteers and 25 individuals with type 2 diabetes indicates that the treatment is also well tolerated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results point to a future where we can improve metabolic health without losing muscle mass. Muscles are important in both type 2 diabetes and obesity, and muscle mass is also directly correlated with life expectancy," says Tore Bengtsson, professor at the Department of Molecular Bioscience, Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Type of β2 Agonist Designed for Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active substance is based on a laboratory-developed molecule, a form of β2 agonist. This molecule activates key signaling pathways in a novel manner that benefits muscle function while avoiding the heart overstimulation typically associated with β2 agonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This drug represents a completely new type of treatment and has the potential to be of great importance for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our substance appears to promote healthy weight loss and, in addition, patients do not have to take injections," says Shane C. Wright, assistant professor at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential as a Stand-Alone or Combination Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this drug operates through a mechanism distinct from GLP-1 medications, it may be effective on its own or when paired with GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This makes them valuable both as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with GLP-1 drugs," says Shane C. Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Research Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage in development is a larger phase II clinical trial planned by Atrogi AB, the company leading the drug's advancement. This study will examine whether the positive effects observed in earlier research also appear in people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work represents a collaboration involving Professor Volker M. Lauschke and teams from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm University, Uppsala University, the University of Copenhagen, Monash University, and the University of Queensland. Funding came from the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and additional sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several authors are employed by or hold shares in Atrogi AB, which financed the clinical trial. Tore Bengtsson is the founder and chief scientific officer of Atrogi AB, which is continuing to develop the drug candidate, and he and a co-author have applied for patents related to the substances examined in the study. Additional company affiliations are detailed in the full publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

President Taylor Randall described in February as an "imminent threat" to the university's mission as a research institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Carter, senior vice president for health sciences and CEO of University of Utah Health, said, "Research, innovation and advancing knowledge is an uncompromising part of who we are as an institution, a culture and a nation," when the cuts were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenges to NIH's attempted cuts to funds known as "indirect costs" of medical research are currently making their way through the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter added that in Utah, National Institutes of Health funding supports over 45,000 jobs and nearly $785 million in economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the U. secured the bulk of its funding from the NIH, with industry partnerships making up the second-largest funding category at $99 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Defense contributed $57.4 million, and additional contributions from the state, other universities and various foundations totaled $110.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Hess, system chief research officer for University of Utah Health, said faculty submitted $2.3 billion in research proposals in 2025 — a $500 million increase compared to the previous year and a testament to the perseverance of the research community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, research in the health sciences sector continued its rise, growing 24% over the past five years and more than doubling since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, health sciences funding accounted for 68% of the university's &lt;a href="https://www.research.utah.edu/facts-and-figures/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;total research portfolio&lt;/a&gt; that totaled $782 million, the university said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;End your day strong with a 5-minute evening routine that builds muscle after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;You’ve likely heard that the best time to build muscle is &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10198889/" target="_blank"&gt;first thing in the morning,&lt;/a&gt; before breakfast or work, and the day gets away from you. But while morning workouts are certainly beneficial, evening strength training can be just as helpful for older adults in building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, you don’t need sixty minute long intense gym sessions to benefit from &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/10-minute-evening-routine-belly-overhang-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;evening exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Even short routines (when done consistently) can prime your muscles, reinforce healthy movement patterns, and make regular training feel more achievable. That’s because &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2025.1493827/full" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that after 50, staying consistent with your exercise becomes one of the most critical factors of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, we chatted with &lt;b&gt;Kris Herbert, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer and owner of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGte-cNyzSn/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gym Venice&lt;/a&gt;, who shares a stellar five-minute evening routine to help you build muscle better than &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-minute-bedtime-routine-builds-strength-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;morning workouts after 50&lt;/a&gt;. However, Herbert explains that, “A five-minute routine will not replace full strength training, and it is not a magic shortcut. That said, short, consistent evening sessions can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/seated-leg-exercises-reverse-muscle-loss-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;keep muscles active&lt;/a&gt;, maintain joint mobility, and reinforce the habit of training.” In other words, even if you’re exhausted at the end of the day, those few minutes of exercise are still worth doing as they keep your body active and help keep you consistent.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following five-minute evening routine cycles between five movements for 30 seconds each, with 15 to 30 seconds between transitions for a total of five minutes. “As strength and confidence improve, gradually increasing challenge is what delivers meaningful gains in muscle, function, and healthy aging,” says Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out exactly how to do it. Then, when you’re finished, be sure to check out these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/7-quick-standing-exercises-better-than-hour-long-workouts-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;7 Quick Standing Exercises That Deliver More Results Than Hour-Long Workouts After 45&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="glute-bridge" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glute Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUgsJ8-Vi0E?si=SXDpdLRvZPCovX0R" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge kickstarts your glutes and hamstrings, which after a long day of sitting, often become underactive and can contribute to lower back pain, weak hips, and poor posture. Fortunately, doing just 30 seconds of controlled glute bridges regularly can help restore strength in these weakened muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels and lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold  briefly at the top then lower with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue for the full 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activates the largest lower body muscles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports hip stability and reduces strain on your lower back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepares your body for more advanced strength training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause for two to three seconds at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your toes slightly to increase heel drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="bird-dog" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bird Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LRjkbEy-qU?si=TDkkn60SxXwo2ihv" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird dog is a unique core-stability exercise that’s widely recommended for reducing lower back pain by &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10305076/" target="_blank"&gt;boosting coordination between spinal stabilizers&lt;/a&gt;. Also, this exercise helps strengthen the deep core muscles that protect your spine and improve balance, which are crucial for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12315335/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy aging and longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get down on your hands and knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend one arm forward and the opposite leg back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold briefly, then return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch sides and continue alternating for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthens deep core stabilizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves balance and cross-body coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces compensations that strain your lower back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold each extension for two to three seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="wall-sit" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wall Sit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wall sit is an isometric hold (where you hold a specific position without moving) that fires up your quads, glutes, and core without requiring movement that stresses sore or stiff joints. This exercise also builds muscle endurance, improves joint control, and reinforces proper alignment for everyday activities like squatting, climbing stairs, or standing up from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your back against a wall and slide down until your knees are bent to a comfortable angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for 15 to 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand briefly to reset, then repeat until the 30-second window ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds strength in major leg muscles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves core stability and posture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports balance and knee control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower deeper into the sit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the entire 30 seconds without standing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="wall-angels" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wall Angels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cdph8hv0O0?si=CPNZI2qPizgGQ0lr" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of slouching, driving, and looking down at screens, shoulders and upper backs can stiffen like crazy. Fortunately, wall angels help counteract this stiffness by strengthening the upper-back muscles while enhancing shoulder mobility. Over time, this can reduce the rounded posture that becomes more common with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your back against a wall, your elbows bent, and your arms raised to shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide your arms up the wall as high as comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue slowly for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases shoulder mobility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthens upper-back muscles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports better posture and overhead movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your wrists touching the wall throughout the entire movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="plank-shoulder-taps" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank Shoulder Taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKA5LBy7WAI?si=T0ja1FjgnV9TfhvO&amp;amp;start=9" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plank shoulder taps are a full-body stability drill that improve core strength, balance, and stability, which are crucial skills that help protect the spine and carry over to daily movements that involve lifting and carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in a plank position on your hands (either on the floor or elevated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widen your feet slightly for better balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap one hand to the opposite shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch sides and continue alternating for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthens deep core stabilizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhances shoulder stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builds anti-rotation control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Progressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to a lower surface or the floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;figure id="attachment_226522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226522" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-226522" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kim-Smith-pre-and-post-her-hand-transplant-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226522" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Amputee Kim Smith pre- and post-transplant – SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman who lost all her limbs after contracting an infection and getting sepsis while on vacation in Spain eight years ago is now thrilled after receiving a new hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Smith and her doctors were trying for a double hand transplant during the 14-hour surgery, but the right hand had to be abandoned. Despite that, she’s ‘over the moon’ and has declared herself now to be left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was right-handed, but now I just do everything left-handed and it came naturally,” said the 64-year-old. “I have even written with my left hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am absolutely over the moon about my new arm, because it feels so incredible, almost as if I’ve had it my whole life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman from Buckinghamshire, England, even joked how her husband Steve was going to buy her new wedding and engagement rings because the fingers of her new hand were slightly bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve gone full-on glass-half-full now—just grateful that at least one transplant worked,” Kim told SWNS news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The hand itself is perfect—and beautiful—and looks like it’s meant to be mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_226523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226523" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-226523" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kim-Smith-after-hand-transplant-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226523" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Kim Smith after hand transplant – SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim described how she was overjoyed when she first saw her new hand, and has been amazed how quickly she’s been able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I honestly didn’t expect to be able to do so much so soon, even though motor skills can take a year or so to come back—four years until I get full feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m already picking things up and managing to clean my teeth, do my hair, and put on my makeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The day after the operation, when they finally unbandaged the arm and let me very gently move my fingertips, it felt absolutely incredible because I could feel myself moving it, and from that moment it has just gone from strength to strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was most excited to brush my teeth and feed myself again because holding a toothbrush or a fork—and actually being able to use it—felt like the loveliest little miracle after being told for so long that ‘it might never work’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_226524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226524" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-226524" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kim-Smith-SWNS-SQUARE.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226524" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Kim Smith – SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first time I picked up a glass of wine with no problem and then held an ice cream without dropping it, I was in disbelief at how far I’d already come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim has pretty much given up on her dream of having two hands, but is happy with her lovely new left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BABY OVERCOMES ZERO ODDS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Guinness Record Holder for Most Premature Baby is Thriving at 1-Year Old–and All Giggles After ‘Zero Odds’ to Live" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/guinness-record-holder-for-most-premature-baby-is-now-thriving-at-one-year-old-and-all-giggles-after-zero-odds-to-live/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Guinness Record Holder for Most Premature Baby is Thriving at 1-Year Old–and All Giggles After ‘Zero Odds’ to Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While I never say never about a right-hand transplant, I’m 64, now and it would mean waiting another year even to be considered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m honestly just happy to have this one for the rest of my life because it’s already giving me so much independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know who the donor was, but I’ve written to their family to say how grateful I am, knowing they’re grieving and (they) might not reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile I’m regaining strength little by little, able to hold my phone, type on it, and wear my Pandora bracelet again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOCTORS RESTORE HIS PASSION&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Conductor with Parkinson’s Gets Brain Stimulation Device to Stop Shakes so He Can Lead Orchestra Once Again" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/conductor-with-parkinsons-gets-brain-stimulation-device-to-stop-shakes-so-he-can-lead-orchestra-once-again/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Conductor with Parkinson’s Gets Brain Stimulation Device to Stop Shakes so He Can Lead Orchestra Once Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim’s transplant was carried out by Professor Simon Peter Jabir Kay OBE at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, who commented on the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hands are so much more than mechanical parts, they play an irreplaceable role in human communication and connection, and so it is always an honor to be able to carry out such a life-changing surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kim faced unexpected and severe complications during surgery which meant we could only successfully complete one hand transplant, not the double replacement we had hoped to carry out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nonetheless her recovery has been remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMAZING&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Schoolgirl With Severely Bowed Legs Gets Life-Changing Surgery to Straighten Them–And is Now 5 Inches Taller" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/schoolgirl-with-severely-bowed-legs-gets-life-changing-surgery-to-straighten-them-and-is-now-5-inches-taller/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Schoolgirl With Severely Bowed Legs Gets Life-Changing Surgery to Straighten Them–And is Now 5 Inches Taller (LOOK)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is the transcript of the interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who now serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Dec. 7, 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy. We're joined now by former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Welcome back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30 year long policy regarding Hepatitis B and newborns. They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is two months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours. For a child over the age of five, if they develop Hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95% chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity. For children between the ages of one and five, they only have about a 25 to 50% chance of clearing the infection, so about 25 to 50% of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of one and five. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection. But when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90% of newborns who become infected, and they'll become infected during delivery, will go on to develop chronic infection, they won't be able to clear the hepatitis B, and about 25% of them will die from sequelae of that infection, either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer. So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract Hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection, it's almost 99% effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: And– &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point, the refrain is, oh, sorry, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States came out and said, this was very good, because Hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true. The fact is, there's a refrain that if you just test the moms during, while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose. But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to, many times, those test results aren't checked, and the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when in fact, you do, of about 2 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but that 2% is going to translate into at least 1000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B, and again, 25% of them will die from that infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration and in this board decision, which the public could listen into. It was publicly broadcast. The board was hand picked by RFK Jr, who is a skeptic here of vaccines, from those who voted against the decision to delay. One of them who you heard at the top of the show said the CDC is doing harm. Another said, "No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused." Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is the ACIP by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda. And look, the Secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization, or many of these childhood immunizations, and I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision making to, and what we're seeing right now is as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored. I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP. The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and not ACIP. So I think in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision making body, and it's going to be more symbolic. There will be certain states that- that adhere to it, but will be more symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: So you this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines. You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines. What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B, this is the vaccines of the future. You're saying just won't be created?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the biologic center. Also oversees the vaccine Division. He also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the Chief Medical Officer of the agency, and chief scientific officer. So he occupies a lot of positions. Put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with, or move away from, what they call immuno bridging studies. These are studies that allow you for well validated vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine, the new vaccine, that's formulated against the circulating strain, can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza. For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a long standing practice. It's, we do it for flu vaccine, we do it in covid Certainly, we do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes circulating bacterial serotypes. This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change, and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the Fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said, they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening. That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the Covid vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said and asked, Did it kill more healthy kids than it saved? The administration, to date, has not backed up information to back up these claims, but, but, what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner, because they're arguing they're doing this to help people?&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next. So the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the covid vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what the concerns are related to the covid vaccine itself. These are- every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves are very subjective and require the goodwill the people involved in that. And so I think that they should make that analysis public so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in that they've already backed away from the 10 is reporting from endpoints that now they're saying it's eight or nine, so they're already backing away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out. Dr Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

This water-soluble vitamin is renowned for its role in boosting the immune system, promoting collagen production, and acting as a powerful antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative damage. &lt;br&gt;Beyond immunity and skin health, vitamin C also enhances iron absorption from plant-based foods, supporting overall metabolic and cardiovascular well-being. &lt;br&gt;Here are the ten best natural sources of vitamin C: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 16:45:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>神经病学家警告年轻的印度人有患帕金森病的风险，揭示了4个早期迹象： “呼吸困难的声音……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/neurologist-warns-young-indians-are-at-risk-of-parkinsons-disease-reveals-4-early-signs-breathier-voice-101765117030994.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/neurologist-warns-young-indians-are-at-risk-of-parkinsons-disease-reveals-4-early-signs-breathier-voice-101765117030994.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-exercise-the-perfect-antidote-to-parkinsons-disease-neurologist-explains-shares-workout-routine-to-follow-101746198675428.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Parkinson's disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is often considered an illness of old age, but now early signs are seen even in young adults, in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

He also shared an example from his practice where the patient ignored all the early signs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, I recently treated a 38-year-old male who had all these symptoms. He brushed them off as routine stress, only to learn that he had young-onset Parkinson’s triggered by a genetic factor,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The neurologist listed out the 4 early signs seen in young adults:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Small handwriting: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A sudden and unexplained shrinking of handwriting size, known as micrographia, is one of the earliest red flags. People often blame stress or exhaustion, but it reflects reduced control of hand movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble moving or walking: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slower walking, stiffness, dragging of one foot, or difficulty turning while walking are classic symptoms. These appear gradually and are often confused with muscle fatigue or lack of exercise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/07/original/1920_1765121533465.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Stiffness in leg is one of the signs.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A soft or low voice: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A voice that becomes softer, breathier, or less expressive can be an early neurological sign. Most people think it is due to throat strain, but Parkinson’s can affect the muscles involved in speech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Tremor: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A slight shaking in the hand or fingers at rest is a well-known symptom, yet many ignore it if it is mild or intermittent. Early tremor is often subtle but clinically significant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurologist emphasised acting promptly and getting regular check-ups, as ignoring subtle signs may lead to complications. He advised, “&lt;span&gt;I highly recommend regular neurological screenings, paying attention to persistent symptoms, maintaining physical activity, and seeking evaluation if you have a family history. This can help immensely with early detection. If you notice any of these signs, consult a doctor promptly rather than waiting for them to worsen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most traditional cereals aren’t great for blood sugar or long-term health. Many popular cereals are ultra-processed, low in protein and fiber, and high in added sugars—leading to energy crashes, cravings, and increased risk of metabolic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy cereals share specific nutrition criteria. Dietitians recommend choosing cereals with ≤5g added sugar, 5–8g protein, 3–5g fiber, whole-food ingredients, and minimal processing—plus healthy fats from nuts or seeds and whole grains listed first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All three nutritionists agree: Seven Sundays is the best healthy cereal brand. The brand stands out for real, nutrient-dense ingredients, balanced macros, low sugar, and satisfying flavors. Recommended varieties include Oat Protein Cereal, Blueberry Almond Real Food Cereal, and Classic Bircher Apple Cinnamon Muesli.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If eating cereal brings you back to the simpler times of childhood, you’re not alone. The breakfast staple is nostalgic, delicious, and most of all—fun! However, if you want to get the most out of cereal, it’s worth being mindful of conventional versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The reason? “Traditional cereals are often ultra-processed, low in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-sources-of-protein-8775868" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitians-favorite-high-fiber-foods-11819806" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and rely heavily on refined grains and added sugars,” explains registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD. This combo can spike your blood sugar first thing in the morning (assuming you’re eating the cereal for breakfast), setting you up for an energy crash and more cravings later in the day, she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, the rapid rise and fall of blood sugar levels can lead to fatigue and hunger soon after meals, shares registered dietitian Seema Shah, MPH, MS, RD. They can also contribute to long-term health consequences, including prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other cardiometabolic issues, Shah points out. Plus, “some traditional cereals contain artificial ingredients and additives, along with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;surprisingly high sodium amounts&lt;/a&gt;, which are not great for our health,” Shah explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, there’s nothing wrong with occasionally enjoying your favorite “fun” cereal. But if you’d like to prioritize nutrition, you may want to eat healthier varieties more often. What do those cereals look like, exactly, and is there a brand that experts recommend? To find out, we asked dietitians to share the top features of a better-for-you cereal, along with their go-to brand.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When shopping for cereal with nutrition in mind, here’s what experts recommend looking for:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is a big one. Whereas traditional cereals tend to be higher in the added sugar department, healthier varieties are usually lower. Aim for a cereal with 5 grams (or less) of added sugar per serving, suggests longevity dietitian Ella Davar, RD. That’s because high sugar intake is the biggest driver of energy crashes, cravings, and poor metabolic health, Davar notes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Choose cereals with at least 5 to 8 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-protein-for-breakfast-8303189" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; [per serving] to help balance your morning and extend fullness,” Davar says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Look for a cereal with 3 to 5 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; per serving, suggests Davar. “Fiber supports gut health, satiety, and stable blood sugar,” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If possible, Davar recommends picking a cereal with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, or coconut. These ingredients contain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, which contribute to satiety and manage inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Whole Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritize whole-food, minimally processed ingredients. Avoid artificial sweeteners, dyes, and preservatives,” Davar says. According to Shah, whole grains should be the first ingredient on the label.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Serving Size &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The serving size listed on the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition label&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be smaller than what you consume,” Shah says. Thus, she suggests converting the nutritional facts to the amount that you’re actually eating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, if you have a GI condition, look for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/desserts/gluten-free-desserts-0" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gluten-free&lt;/a&gt; or grain-free variety. “Many people with digestive issues do better with oat-, nut-, or seed-based blends,” explains Davar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-the-healthiest-cereal-brand"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Is the Healthiest Cereal Brand? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The next time you shop for cereal, consider the factors listed above. Alternatively, if you’d rather get an expert recommendation, you’re in luck: When asked to name their favorite healthy cereal brands, all three dietitians called out &lt;strong&gt;Seven Sundays&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Seven Sundays stands out because it focuses on real, nutrient-dense ingredients rather than the ultra-processed grains and additives common in traditional breakfast cereals,” Davar explains. “Seven Sundays is much closer to a functional food than a conventional boxed cereal,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More specifically, the brand does an excellent job balancing protein, healthy fats, and fiber, something you rarely see in the cereal aisle, Peterson notes. This combo is “genuinely supportive of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/habits-for-healthy-metabolism-11799741" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, hormone health, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/most-satiating-foods-8424198" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lasting fullness&lt;/a&gt; in a way that fits real life,” Peterson adds. Plus, Seven Sundays products are not only nutritious and well-balanced, but delicious too, per Shah.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re new to Seven Sundays, here’s a specific recommendation from each dietitian:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Sundays Oat Protein Cereal:&lt;/strong&gt; “This cereal uses &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/benefits-of-oatmeal" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oats&lt;/a&gt; as the star ingredient, delivering a naturally high-fiber, whole-grain base with added oat protein to make it more filling than traditional cereals,” explains Peterson. Plus, unlike most cereals, it has a short recognizable ingredient list, low added sugar, and balanced macros that keep you satisfied, Peterson adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Sundays Blueberry Almond Real Food Cereal: &lt;/strong&gt;Featuring whole almonds, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/benefits-of-blueberries" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;, and oat clusters, this cereal is high in fiber and naturally sweetened, according to Davar. It also offers a great balance of carbs, fat, and protein, a combo that can keep blood sugar stable, she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Sundays Classic Bircher Apple Cinnamon Muesli:&lt;/strong&gt; With gluten-free oats listed as the first ingredient, this cereal is appropriate for gluten-free diets. It’s also high in fiber and protein and low in total sugars. This makes it a “nourishing and tasty option for breakfast that will give you sustained energy and balanced blood sugar levels throughout the morning,” explains Shah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember: You don’t need to give up your favorite childhood cereals to be healthy. Instead, enjoy them as the occasional treat, and focus on healthier versions (like those from Seven Sundays) for your daily bowl.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is still struggling to pass her bar exam. Last month, she &lt;a href="https://people.com/kim-kardashian-reveals-why-she-was-so-quick-to-share-that-she-didnt-pass-the-bar-exam-11862271" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that she’d failed the test, a major setback in her journey to become an attorney, and she’s even &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/kim-kardashian-chatgpt-fail-law-school-tests"&gt;accused ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; of making her “fail tests all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Now, in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRpr1iDFZwY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=5216befa-83cf-4301-8e13-06c94748b854" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent episode of “The Kardashians&lt;/a&gt;” her doctor told her that she has “holes” in her brain, based on recent scans, which are related to “low activity” and caused by chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Don’t necessarily take it at face value. In a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/kim-kardashians-brain-scan-shows-low-activity-and-holes-im-a-brain-expert-and-i-have-questions-271083" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent piece for &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Curtin University neurology senior research fellow Sarah Hellewell warned that there’s little merit to the tech used by Kardashian’s physician, and that we should take his diagnosis with a massive grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While “holes” in the brain and “low activity” sounds “incredibly sad and concerning, doctors and scientists have doubts about the technology used and its growing commerciali&lt;strong&gt;z&lt;/strong&gt;ation,” Hellewell writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Recent MRI scans led to Kim being &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kim-kardashian-brain-aneurysm-diagnosis-what-know-condition-rcna239393" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with a brain aneurysm&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. However, the tech on display in the latest episode of her hit TV series shows a different type of imaging being used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Single-photon emission tomography, or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SPECT, “involves injecting radioactive chemicals into the blood and using a special camera which creates 3D images of organs, including the brain,” Hellewell explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It can be used to track and measure blood flow and diagnose brain, heart, and bone conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But “while SPECT has some clinical use under limited circumstances, there is not good evidence for SPECT scans outside these purposes,” Hellewell cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Proponents have &lt;a href="https://www.amenclinics.com/is-it-dementia-or-something-else-spect-has-answers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that SPECT can be used to diagnose a number of conditions, including Alzheimer’s, ADHD, and eating disorders. However, the scientific community remains skeptical of these claims, arguing that the imaging technique is largely “&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-daniel-amen-called-a-snake-oil-salesman-by-critics-and-former-patients-over-spect-brain-scans/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;snake oil&lt;/a&gt;” based on &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10020157" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;unfounded&lt;/a&gt; scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Scans could potentially show changes in blood flow, though these may be common across conditions,” Hellewell writes. “Blood flow can also vary depending on the area of the brain examined, time of day, and even how well-rested a person is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The “holes” in Kardashian’s brain are likely areas of reduced blood flow, which could indicate a number of things. According to Hellewell, there’s no credible evidence that these changes have anything to do with chronic stress, as her doctor claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Worst of all, doctors have warned that diagnoses based on SPECT scans could lead to patients being recommended the wrong or at least an entirely ineffective treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Patients also have to shoulder the full expense of a scan since it’s not “not recognized as a medical requirement,” per Hellewell, which can cost “upwards of $3,000.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In short, wealthy individuals like Kardashian may be taken advantage of by being roped into expensive SPECT scans that give them muddy medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“While imaging tools such as SPECT and MRI may be genuinely used to diagnose many conditions, there is no medical need for healthy people to have them,” Hellewell concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
