            Now, researchers are trying to learn how many people have “young COPD,” meaning the condition is diagnosed before 50 years of age. “Young COPD” was present in 4.5% of adults under 50 in the population studied, a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fevidence.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FEVIDoa2400424&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027673942654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=hl3YvrA1ft0R29S5HHFnpjPy8EhltzbCD0GIl16oaVg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;NEJM Evidence&lt;/a&gt;​ found. The diagnosis was associated with a significantly elevated risk of hospitalization due to lower respiratory disease and an increased risk of death before 75.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What is COPD, and what are the risk factors for developing this condition? And why might young COPD increase mortality risk? What should people with COPD do to improve their health outcomes?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

The two most common types of COPD are emphysema, which occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and lose their ability to stretch and exchange oxygen, and chronic bronchitis, which is marked by long-term inflammation and narrowing of the airways, often with excess mucus and a persistent cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who currently smoke or previously smoked have a higher chance of developing COPD. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, polluted air or other environmental workplace hazards. In addition, individuals with a history of asthma and a family history of COPD are at higher risk for having COPD.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the study authors, previous researchers have used varying definitions of “young COPD.” For instance, some have included only those who have had a smoking history. This study used a more expansive definition to account for nonsmokers with COPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000g3b6ni3l9a371@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, individuals must meet three sets of criteria. The first is having a spirometry measurement showing airflow obstruction. Spirometry is a breathing test that measures how much air a person can exhale and how quickly, which helps determine whether the lungs are blocked or narrowed. The second is having either 10 or more &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdictionaries%2Fcancer-terms%2Fdef%2Fpack-year&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674009427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XQUtwlel9G7Jm2Nj7pcKJzwY8d6t%2FWRGWAF4kJuH8kI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pack years&lt;/a&gt; of smoking, or symptoms of cough, phlegm and trouble breathing. The third is age between 18 and 49 years old.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers examined four groups of people who were already participating in other research studies. This is important because they were not selected based on smoking exposure or existence of respiratory illnesses; therefore, their health characteristics broadly reflected the overall US population. Using this definition, they determined that the prevalence of young COPD was 4.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000j3b6n8fwnljcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers then tracked outcomes of participants with young COPD compared with those without this condition. They found that premature mortality, defined as death before 75 years of age, was increased more than 1.4 times among those with young COPD. The likelihood of hospitalization or death due to chronic lung disease was more than 2.5 times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The first step is to be aware that they carry the diagnosis.

They may attribute a chronic cough to a persistent virus or shortness of breath to aging. Or they may think that because they never smoked, they can’t have COPD. This is not correct. While smoking is a major risk factor for developing COPD, according to the American Lung Association, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Fsymptoms-diagnosis%2Fearly-warning-signs%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520over%252016%2520million%2Cis%2520often%2520manageable%2520and%2520treatable.&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674111124%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1ZL695cfj%2BmAk5QC2p3ME1Bs88DW2ChsMLmQZ212lTk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 4 people&lt;/a&gt; with COPD never smoked.

            Once someone is diagnosed with COPD, their physician or other primary care provider will recommend a combination of therapies. These include lifestyle changes, most notably quitting smoking. Other important steps may include staying physically active, reducing exposure to air pollution and secondhand smoke, and participating in &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-procedures-and-tests%2Fpulmonary-rehab&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674160463%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=sDyGLhKRFiJLPllVdQokdh02oRFq3ecB74ShM%2Fd4sy0%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pulmonary rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a structured program of exercise, education and support designed to improve ease of breathing and overall quality of life.

            Making sure to stay up-to-date with vaccinations is essential, as people with COPD are at greater risk of serious illness if they were to contract respiratory illnesses. They should speak with their providers about whether they are &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;up-to-date with vaccines&lt;/a&gt; including streptococcal pneumonia, pertussis, Covid-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.

These include bronchodilators that relax the airway muscles and anti-inflammatories that reduce inflammation and mucus production. Individuals with COPD should also be alert to early signs of infection. They may receive specific antiviral treatment, and antibiotics are often given if a bacterial infection is suspected since infections can quickly worsen breathing problems.

The first is in your chest. The second is in your calves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every step, every heal raise, every muscle squeeze pushes blood back to your real heart, keeps your circulation alive, and stops deadly clots from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But here's the problem. Our modern lifestyle is killing it. We sit for hours. We walk less than ever. We lose muscle as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US-based cardiologist Dr Dmitry Yaranov has warned that moving around more each day, even just for minutes at a time, could vastly reduce the odds of suffering 'deadly clots', which raise the risk of heart issues &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your "second heart" fails, your first one is forced to work harder—circulation slows, swelling begins, blood pressure rises, and your risk of heart failure skyrockets.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Move. Walk daily. Do heel raises at your desk. Take the stairs. Keep your calf muscles strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't wait until it's too late—start today. Your future self will thank you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously studies have shown walking 10,000 steps a day can lower risk of heart disease, cancer and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14937193/scientists-reveal-number-daily-steps-prevent-dementia.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested just 7,000 steps a day was enough to lower risk of dementia, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also suggested the pace we walk may be just as important.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, US scientists who studied more than 79,850 adults found a short brisk was more beneficial than walking at a slower pace for three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a worrying &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14724297/heart-health-declining-record-rate.html"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in heart-related deaths in the UK, which have soared 18 per cent from 18,693 to 21,975 between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), there has also been a 21 per cent rise in the number of people being diagnosed with heart failure since 2020—the highest on record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of people with atrial fibrillation—irregular heartbeat—has also increased to a record high—1.62 million up from 1.48 million over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF analysis also revealed an 83 per cent rise in the number of people waiting for planned heart hospital treatment in England, from the start of the decade to March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiac waiting lists have also grown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF said the concerning shift follows decades of progress that had seen annual deaths from conditions like a heart attack and stroke half since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity suggested the rise could be driven by a rise in processed foods and unhealthy diets, the impact of Covid infections on the heart and circulatory system as well as disruption to routine and GP appointments and heart care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:19:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWFR3bXZqM1RKaWl5NGk0Ny15cG1NbEFFUUpVMVdSVGVGbTB0R1lZekRRdTkyNVF0X1VrcDZ3amh2VnJxcFJ1cW1oV1o0WVhYTENsUnlKa1NwSl9pWXB0TzhMXzR2ZTZwQ0dmQ2twVzI0QnRwa1pnazBoZHJKbWtTaUJPMFAxS3FOMm5mb1I2RDdra1Fwbm1IN0E3WDBiZ1FaUjFRQV8yU3QwSGw2QkFR0gG0AUFVX3lxTE85Q0ZVZTdheUMwMG1fbk4yM1EtYU1vQWo0T3VJQUEwTzN6WlgzeWdaT3BxMFNxVDlEMTByaWRYWXd2MTBoZ2xxSDljcklNVk1PdGZlVElTbmM5VXFGQ0Qtek90YmVSVXBzSnpNYUhTOVFRdWkyNTZETGYyX1ZweEx3elFzQklwalJSaDhZVmtscnVLZG1FWHRUYzJpaU5JX2ZaYWdOd2U4WUhKUzNpTWlFMkJkRw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心在有关衰弱性疾病激增的情况下发出旅行警告： “采取强化预防措施” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cdc-issues-travel-warning-amid-090000423.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a travel health notice for China after a spike in chikungunya infections, a mosquito-borne illness that can cause debilitating joint pain and fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since the first reported infection in early July, China has documented more than 8,000 cases of chikungunya, with Guangdong province at the center of the outbreak, per &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/06/chikungunya-virus-outbreak-china-symptoms-cause/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Washington Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC said it was assessing the outbreak's size and impact, noting that travel health notices alert people to risks and advise on prevention measures, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/cdc-weighs-travel-notice-for-china-as-chikungunya-cases-rise" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, the CDC has issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Level 2 alert;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Level 2 alert&lt;/a&gt;, meaning travelers should "practice enhanced precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya, spread by Aedes mosquitoes, often causes a fever that comes on suddenly and severe joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet. The CDC warns that older adults are especially vulnerable, and recent safety reviews have paused use of the live-virus chikungunya vaccine in people over 60. With European regulators also reassessing its use, prevention hinges on bite protection — a challenge in densely populated, humid areas such as Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this chikungunya outbreak important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While outbreaks typically happen in tropical and subtropical regions, warmer global conditions are expanding mosquitoes' range. The World Health Organization issued a warning in July after similar outbreaks in Indian Ocean islands showed signs of escalating into an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This outbreak is yet another example of how rising global temperatures are helping to spread vector-borne diseases, especially as international travel moves them quickly across borders. Aedes mosquitoes can also carry dengue, Zika, and yellow fever — all illnesses that have reached record or near-record case counts in multiple regions over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While China doesn't have access to the two chikungunya vaccines that have been approved in the United States, its government has said it's employing preventative measures such as quarantining, spraying mosquito repellent with drones, and releasing fish into ponds to eat mosquito larvae, according to the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC's Level 2 advisory has been extended to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine countries&lt;/a&gt; with chikungunya outbreaks. Some ways people can protect themselves include wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in places with screened or air-conditioned rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is a reminder that protecting public health will increasingly require quick outbreak responses as the planet continues to warm. In the long run, curbing heat-trapping pollution is the most important part of preventing these diseases from spreading more easily.

Lastly, I'll stand tall and perform 5-10 slow forward folds, increasing my range with each rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key for each exercise, and especially the prone extension moves, is to allow my lower back, glutes and legs to completely relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been carrying so much tension in my lower back—likely due to aggravating the muscles earlier this year—that as a defence mechanism my body has tightened up the area to protect the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as muscle guarding, this protective response occurs when the muscles tense up to limit movement around an injury, but prolonged guarding can cause longer-term weakness and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nursing a tight lower back, I'd recommend you first consult your doctor or physician. But if they give you the all clear to stretch and mobilize your lower back, this McKenzie Method routine could help melt away some of that discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-i-felt-after-doing-the-stretches" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-i-felt-after-doing-the-stretches"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How I felt after doing the stretches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="a0b6c30c-ba5e-4b30-8e6b-4a5aaeff001f"&gt;When I first started these McKenzie Method stretches, and allowed my lower back to truly relax, it felt like cool water was radiating across an area that had been hot and inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week on, I'm still very much a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tightness can occasionally build up across the day but I'm willing to persevere with these mobility exercises while I work to strengthen my posterior chain and core to hopefully reduce the risk of future damage.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's find out more...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New Blood Pressure guidelines overview&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new guidelines, adults must have blood pressure levels below 130/80 mm Hg for optimal health. The guidelines also promote lifestyle modifications that include salt reduction, together with limited alcohol intake, increased physical exercise and essential weight reduction to control blood pressure. The recommendations work to decrease the probabilities of heart attack, stroke, kidney damage and dementia development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even more important for diabetics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with diabetes face elevated chances of developing hypertension, which leads to worse diabetes complications as well as higher heart disease probability. Blood pressure control stands as an essential diabetes management practice, because it protects blood vessels and organs from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight Loss: A key strategy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines identify losing at least 5% of body weight as an essential method for blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weight loss of 5% results in a 5 mm Hg reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. This reduction improves heart health, and reduces the strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The specific advantages of weight loss for diabetic patients&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of 5-10% body weight provides diabetic patients with important health advantages, which extend beyond blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss enables the body to utilise insulin more effectively, thus it lowers blood sugar levels, and decreases the possibility of diabetes-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate weight reduction leads to significant blood pressure decreases that lower the risk of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved Lipid Levels: Weight loss improves ‘good’ cholesterol (HDL) and lowers triglycerides, both important for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research evidence supporting the guidelines&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that diabetic adults who lost between 5-10% of their body weight, achieved substantial improvements in blood sugar control (HbA1c reduction), blood pressure and blood fats. Research findings indicate that larger weight loss amounts produce more extensive advantages. The resulting modifications safeguard both heart health and kidney function, while leading to enhanced wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive effects of weight loss persist, even if some weight gain occurs in the future.

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health says a wastewater sample collected this month tested positive for the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said in a news release today that the sample was collected Aug. 11 from a site in West Hawaii County and is the first wastewater detection of measles in the state. DOH was notified of the result on Aug. 26, and is monitoring for signs of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, however, there have been no new reports of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the presence of measles virus in wastewater does not confirm a clinical case or community spread, but is a signal to be alert and prepared for possible measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The recent detection of measles virus in our wastewater is a reminder that this disease is still a threat,” said Gov. Josh Green in the news release. “Vaccination remains our strongest defense to stop measles before it spreads in Hawaii. Let’s work together to protect each other and keep our islands safe and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state routinely collects and tests wastewater samples as part of disease surveillance, which &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/04/18/hawaii-news/monitoring-for-covid-in-hawaii-wastewater-expected-to-start-this-summer/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;became widespread&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to help track the presence of numerous pathogens, including COVID, avian influenza, and norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastewater monitoring serves as an early-warning system for emerging outbreaks, as infected people begin shedding a virus in their waste in two to three days, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, national wastewater surveillance companies began testing for measles as an &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/26/breaking-news/texas-measles-outbreak-worsened-as-cdc-silenced-under-trump/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt; spread to other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WastewaterSCAN began testing for measles in May, while NWSS-Verily did so in July, followed by Biobot Analytics in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has so far this year has only confirmed two measles cases. Both were confirmed in April before measles wastewater testing began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April, DOH confirmed measles in an &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;unvaccinated child&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 5 on Oahu. The child began developing symptoms after returning from international travel. About 10 days later, DOH confirmed a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/17/breaking-news/hawaiis-2nd-measles-case-confirmed-in-household-member/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;second measles case&lt;/a&gt; in an adult member of the same household as the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No further measles cases were reported after the two in April, and state health officials said they are not related to this recent wastewater detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department, meanwhile, is urging everyone to stay up to date on the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is highly contagious but preventable through vaccination,” health officials in the release. “Infants under 1 year of age are at particularly high risk because they are too young to be vaccinated, but in certain situations, vaccination may be recommended for children between 6 and 12 months if they are exposed to a known case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an MMR vaccine, families should contact their medical provider or pharmacy. Additionally, anyone who has traveled to an area with a current measles outbreak should consult a doctor upon developing symptoms, which include a fever, runny nose, and cough, followed by the spread of tiny, red spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases in the U.S has ramped up significantly this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, more than 1,400 measles cases have been confirmed in over 40 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest number since measles was declared eliminated 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

When we’re stressed and overwhelmed, we tend to gather clutter and misplace things. When we’re disconnected from people and purpose, communication diminishes, mail accumulates, and emails go unread. As &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/enlightened-living/200807/how-the-environment-we-create-is-a-reflection-of-our-state-of-mind" target="_blank"&gt;psychotherapist Michael J. Formica&lt;/a&gt; explains, a person’s home reflects their “global state of mind” — a mix of emotional, social, spiritual, and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When seemingly superficial things like clutter and messes seem to run rampant at home, they can also be a sign of something deeper and more personal. If you notice these things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit. Even if some of these things are normal in the home of a well-functioning and happy person, they can also be connected to chronic stress, unhappiness, and general disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

If you make your bed in the morning and everything else in your day goes “wrong,” at least you have a comfortable, made bed to come home to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you usually see an unmade bed at someone else’s house, they might be struggling more than they let on — neglecting the simplest way to protect their mood and sanity just for a few more minutes of sleep or rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/small-things-you-can-do-morning-so-you-dont-want-get-back-bed-and-hide"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Small Things You Can Do In The Morning So You Don't Want To Get Back In Bed And Hide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Self-neglect, like &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22609-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;another study from the BMC Public Health journal&lt;/a&gt;, is connected with symptoms of depression and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, even if things like personal hygiene and doing chores seem simple, neglecting them can cause mental health issues and be a side effect of not doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-improved-mental-health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Phrases That Actually Improved My Mental Health When I Was At My Lowest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A major new study reveals 3 simple lifestyle changes that can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by nearly a third.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting a Mediterranean-style diet while also reducing daily calories, engaging in moderate physical activity, and receiving professional weight-loss support may lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 31%, according to new research led in part by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/harvard-university/"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re facing a global epidemic of diabetes,” said co-author Frank Hu, Fredrick J. Stare Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology and chair of the Department of Nutrition. “With the highest-level evidence, our study shows that modest, sustained changes in diet and lifestyle could prevent millions of cases of this disease worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have associated the Mediterranean diet, which centers on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, with moderate amounts of dairy and lean proteins and little to no red meat, with improved health outcomes. These benefits include lowering the risk of T2D by improving &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; sensitivity and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers working on the PREDIMED-Plus clinical trial, the largest randomized study in Europe to examine diet and lifestyle, set out to determine how the Mediterranean diet’s advantages could be further strengthened by pairing it with additional healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Study Design and Participants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from 23 universities in Spain and Harvard Chan School, split 4,746 PREDIMED-Plus participants into an intervention group and a control group and followed their health outcomes for six years. The intervention group adhered to a Mediterranean diet; reduced their caloric intake by about 600 calories per day; engaged in moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking and strength and balance exercises; and received professional support for weight loss control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group adhered to a Mediterranean diet without calorie restriction, exercise guidance, or professional support. Participants ranged from age 55 to 75, were overweight or obese, and had metabolic syndrome, but were free of T2D at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Results and Findings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that those in the intervention group had a 31% lower risk of developing T2D compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the intervention group lost an average of 3.3 kilograms and reduced their waist circumference by 3.6 centimeters, compared to 0.6 kilograms and 0.3 centimeters in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In practical terms, adding calorie control and physical activity to the Mediterranean diet prevented around three out of every 100 people from developing diabetes—a clear, measurable benefit for public health,” said co-author Miguel Martínez-González, professor at the University of Navarra and adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School.&lt;/p&gt;

That picture is mostly right, but it may be missing a a key component. According to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1096050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, common mouth bacteria that usually stay in their lane may drift into the bloodstream and trigger heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that mouth microbes don’t just float through the bloodstream and disappear, as has always been understood to be the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may take up residence inside &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arterial plaque&lt;/a&gt; and help spark the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifestyle-choices-in-young-adulthood-impact-cognitive-ability-in-midlife/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that makes a weak spot crack. That is the sort of crack that can set off a clot and cut off blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-and-heart-artery-plaques"&gt;Bacteria and heart artery plaques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaques form inside blood vessels over time. They are made of fats, cholesterol, immune cells, and scar-like tissue. Many sit there without causing trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk rises when the thin outer layer – the fibrous cap – breaks. Once that cover fails, the plaque’s contents meet the bloodstream; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-blood-cells-found-to-squeeze-clots-tight-using-physical-force/"&gt;a clot can form&lt;/a&gt;, and a heart attack can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on whether bacteria from the mouth, especially a group called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/viridans-streptococci" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;viridans streptococci&lt;/a&gt;, could be tucked into those plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central question was: were bacteria hiding out and then helping to drive inflammation right where it hurts most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed artery plaques from two sources: people who died suddenly and patients having surgery to clear clogged neck arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not rely on one test. They used DNA methods to detect bacterial genetic traces, special stains to locate bacteria in tissue, and gene activity analyses to see which immune pathways were active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tested how different bacterial components trigger early warning signals in immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pattern recognition receptors – the body’s “burglar alarms” – were a key focus, including a pathway called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/tlr2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR2&lt;/a&gt; that is well known for spotting bacterial signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilm-bacteria-and-the-heart"&gt;Biofilm bacteria and the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the deeper parts of many plaques, the team found signs that viridans streptococci were living together as a biofilm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biofilm is a community of bacteria embedded in a protective matrix that helps them stick to a surface and shield themselves from stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those plaque cores, immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-failure-creates-a-lasting-stress-memory-in-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; did not appear to react to the biofilm. In other words, the bacteria appeared tucked away where the body’s defenses were not mounting a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-bacteria-break-bad"&gt;When bacteria break bad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture changed at the edges of plaques that were cracked or appeared unstable. There, the researchers saw scattered bacteria that appeared to have broken free from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/biofilms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hidden biofilm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift coincided with activation of immune alarms. Pattern recognition receptors lit up – especially through TLR2 – a classic “we found bacteria” signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alarm did not just activate the rapid innate immune response; it also drew in the slower, more targeted adaptive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking,” explained &lt;a href="https://researchportal.tuni.fi/en/persons/pekka-karhunen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Pekka Karhunen&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material – DNA – from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-bacteria-signals"&gt;Heart disease and bacteria signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples that tested positive for viridans streptococci tended to come from plaques that were more advanced and complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autopsy series, bacterial signals lined up with deaths due to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That association does not prove the bacteria caused the deaths, but it strengthens the idea that they may play a role in a dangerous chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-life-implications"&gt;Daily life implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brushing-your-teeth-regularly-can-prevent-deadly-liver-disease/"&gt;Oral health&lt;/a&gt; has long been linked with heart health in population studies. Everyday activities like brushing or chewing can push mouth bacteria into the bloodstream, especially when gums are inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings point to a path where certain mouth bacteria might colonize plaques, lie low in biofilms, and then shed pieces that trigger inflammation right where the plaque is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a call for antibiotics to prevent heart attacks. It does not turn brushing into a magic shield against heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, and family history still carry a lot of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests bacteria – especially in biofilm form – may be another player that nudges risky plaques toward rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-need-answers"&gt;More questions need answers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, this surprising, peer-reviewed study links oral bacteria within arterial plaques to inflammation associated with plaque rupture, highlighting a plausible mouth-heart connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps include testing whether targeting biofilms, improving oral health, or dialing down specific immune alarms could make plaques more stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also need to sort out cause versus correlation and identify which bacterial features matter most inside human arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-should-do"&gt;What you should do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, continue to follow the basic guidelines urged by the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-and-cholesterol-a-new-twist-in-an-old-debate/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in check. Do not smoke or vape. Move your body most days. Sleep well. Eat in a way that supports cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up with dental basics also – regular brushing, flossing, and routine checkups reduce the chances that mouth bacteria slip into your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these habits are cure-alls on their own, but together they lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 02:26:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQU3VwRlNzakVNQTRudmhLXy0yMDlyN1lJSllkMHVZWEhPYTliYlhtdzVhQXRRR0J1cXVqaDZlWE1MX1Niai1xOFlPWDBQY0dXNVNTSUdmMTg0elZJaF8tT0lXM2RJa25WbE5tbzM2bkNid29QMnJmQzZqbk5MUE1DbUk5b0owZHhYdVhZX2Nvd19VMWRFSFluQ3dJdVNzbGhmQndPZmROTGVNVW5zQUIzdHRkVQ</guid></item><item><title>20岁的锻炼……每周只需16分钟--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15039727/workout-two-decades-life-heart-health-cardio.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A simple workout routine performed once a week could help reverse your heart health by two decades, a leading cardiologist has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine and cardiology at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-774899d0-837e-11f0-a78a-a5e05d4aa3d1"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Southwestern Medical Center, is a big advocate of the 'Norwegian 4x4'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This high-intensity workout, which he says is practiced by the Norwegian ski team, involves pushing yourself to 90 to 95 percent of your maximum heart rate for four, four-minute intervals once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the suggested activities include running, biking ,and rowing, pushing yourself to your limit for the allotted time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the four minutes are up, you then take&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/heart-cardio-workouts/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;three minutes of recovery time before doing another four-minute set. This pattern should be repeated four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doing just one routine of the Norwegian 4x4 per week will reap big rewards for your heart health, Dr Levine says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prove how advantageous the Norwegian 4x4 can be, Dr Levine recruited 53 participants with an average age of 53, and he assigned them a fitness plan for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only vigorous part of the plan was the Norwegian 4x4, which the participants were told to perform once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A simple workout routine performed once a week could help reverse your heart health by two decades, a leading cardiologist has revealed (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other elements of their program included one hour of doing a 'fun' physical activity per week, such as dancing or playing a sport, one 30-minute session of strength training,  and two to three days of moderate-intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the two-year period, the middle-aged participants, who were previously sedentary, saw a dramatic improvement in their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine used a heart catheterization (a diagnostic procedure a healthcare provider uses to see how well your heart is working) to measure the flexibility or 'youthfulness' of their hearts and found, after the study, their hearts were comparable to someone in their 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the heart ages, the main artery (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/heart-cardio-workouts/"&gt;said the results&lt;/a&gt; of his study were 'quite compelling, and showed that it is possible to reverse some of the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle if you commit to a heart-healthy exercise routine in late middle age (40 to 64 years).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He carried out a follow-up study involving patients in the same age range who had 'thickened' aortas that made them high risk for heart disease or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that they were given the same exercise treatment plan for one year, and they showed a similar improvement in the elasticity, or 'youthfulness,' of their heart muscle as the research team saw in healthy middle-aged individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart expert concluded: 'This study shows that dedicated exercise training in middle age can reverse some of the consequences of diseases such as hypertension, and can potentially stave off more serious diseases such as heart failure in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease continues to kill more people in the US than any other cause, according to the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022 (the most recent year for which final data is available), there were nearly 1million deaths from coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke - collectively referred to as cardiovascular disease - the equivalent of a death every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer, meanwhile, kills roughly 600,000 Americans per year, while dementia is responsible for 288,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the American Heart Association say a lack of awareness compared to other diseases like cancer and an increase in risk factors may be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'. He says: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, heart disease can be a silent killer, lurking for decades before symptoms start to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also warn that while deaths from heart disease may be starting to plateau for the first time since the pandemic, risk factors for the disease are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of US adults have high blood pressure, for example, and almost three-quarters are overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts reveal that if trends continue, two-thirds of US adults will become obese and suffer high blood pressure by 2050, further increasing their risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of heart and circulatory diseases by up to 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults should get 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A regular exercise routine will help you keep your heart healthy for years to come. Jog, swim, golf, hike, play basketball, dance, do yoga - whatever you love to do. The most important thing is to get out there and do it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — &lt;span&gt;Two people have died after eating Louisiana oysters infected with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3OwuXwXyGrlhFrf80ckg-Z" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Vibrio vulnificus, officials confirmed to WBRZ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A state health official said that the two deaths happened after people ate oysters harvested in Louisiana at two separate restaurants — one in Louisiana and another in Florida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator from the Louisiana Department of Health, added that 14 more people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, 34 people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and six people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2i5x39Du_6Od_uOxM2hMJ9" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;died in 2025 alone,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a higher rate than any previous year over the last decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just prolific right now,” Armentor told the Louisiana Oyster Task Force on Tuesday at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBRZ spoke with Jones Creek Cafe &amp;amp; Oyster Bar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CEO George Shaheen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; about this news and how seafood spots ensure that their oysters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tasty and safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen has been at the head of his business for nearly 40 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Well, over the years, we haven't had as much of that as you would actually think because the way that the Wildlife and Fisheries and the Department of Health have created a bond between the fishermen who are out there fishing and how things need to be done and handled," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen told WBRZ that he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; his oysters from Delacroix Island, where he used to fish, and has complete trust in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who harvest the oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You have to go out, and when you go on a boat and you're an oyster fisherman out there, you can stay out there, I think it's 72 hours if you have a way to cool the oysters when they come in," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen showed WBRZ some tickets that are put onto oyster sacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tickets &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; information such as where the oysters were harvested and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they were harvested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically is really the key to being able to, if something happens somewhere, they know right where to go. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Department of Health, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to keep these for 90 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; We get checked every 120 days," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He says that modern growing and harvesting techniques make for better oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Now, they use limestone out in the marsh to basically grow the oysters on, and they're much cleaner. The difference between you getting them out of the marsh mud and being on a Limestone is that they're much cleaner," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Restaurants in Louisiana are required by law to display visible signs or messages about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; eating raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Yes, cause you never know what's in the ocean and what gets inside these oysters, so if they're not cooked, you can easily get bacteria, so you have to put a warning out for people," Jones Creek bartender Amanda Steele said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customers WBRZ spoke with at Jones Creek share the same trust that the restaurant does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These include "fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes," officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While many people believe plague to be a disease of the distant past, it has been endemic in the Western U.S. since a plague outbreak took place in San Francisco around the turn of the 20th century.

Prior to the current incident, the last case of human plague in El Dorado County took place in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to county officials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to county officials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, with the plague being spread to humans by infected fleas, the situation served as a reminder of the risks that insect-borne diseases still pose to human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many parts of the world, mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases like malaria and dengue fever have been spreading beyond their traditional geographic ranges due in large part to rising global temperatures. These expanding ranges place more people at risk of contracting these life-threatening illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the plague?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To reduce the risk of contracting the plague, El Dorado County officials &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; taking several measures, some of which would also be effective in protecting oneself against other diseases spread by insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These recommendations included wearing long pants tucked into boot tops when hiking through natural areas and avoiding wild rodents such as squirrels and chipmunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since infected fleas can catch a ride on family pets, officials also recommended keeping dogs on a leash while in nature areas and not letting pets near wild rodents, especially dead ones, or their burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recjRV0EN8bHSuzXF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUZrcXpPcExrN080c0VwSUNJTUs4QmkzVUt5eUhCMkdlb3o4Q3BsOGluS20td3Rxaks5OGR0MF9KZlZFRkI2NzJsNkdJbGxoU2dtYUltZGttUU9OMzZNOFRGQ3k0djZQQnl0MVFUM1piNUdvZ3dqeGhiUUN6YmJfSFBQU0dCazBzWVpwcnFkUHM2RFU</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将这4个因素与更高的卒中风险联系起来- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/stroke-risk-index-study-11798088</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher TyG-WWI index scores are linked to an increased risk of stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The index combines triglycerides, blood sugar, body weight and waist size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study findings suggest potential for early stroke risk detection and prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and though there were years of progress in reducing its impact, in recent years, strokes have become more and more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance, a condition where the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, plays a key role in stroke recurrence and poor recovery, often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With rising global obesity rates, conditions like insulin resistance and related stroke risks are becoming more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Measures like the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, which indicates insulin resistance, and the weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), which evaluates fat distribution, have been shown to predict stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A new combined measure, the TyG-WWI index, has recently been linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt; in people with prediabetes, but its role in the general population is still unclear. Understanding how these markers work together could help improve &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-9am-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-11745518" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stroke prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored whether the TyG-WWI index health measure is linked to stroke risk in the general population. The goal was to find better ways to assess stroke risk, improve healthcare management and develop timely strategies to help people who are at high risk of having a stroke, and these results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is a large U.S. health study that collects data to monitor the nation’s health and nutrition. It uses a special sampling method to ensure the results represent the entire population. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers analyzed NHANES data from 1999 to 2018, focusing on adults, resulting in 22,615 adults in the analysis. The main focus was on the health measure the TyG-WWI index, which combines triglyceride levels, blood sugar, body weight and waist size to assess health risks. Blood samples and body measurements were taken by trained professionals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, income and health conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease) were also considered to better understand stroke risk. The data was then analyzed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study looked at how TyG-WWI values—which reflect both the triglyceride glucose index and the weight-adjusted waist index—are linked to stroke risk. Researchers found that as TyG-WWI values increased, so did the risk of stroke. Initially, without considering any other factors, a rise in TyG-WWI values was linked to a 65% higher stroke risk. After accounting for age and sex, the increased risk dropped to 24%, and when all other factors were considered, it was 15%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to compare, participants were divided into four groups based on their TyG-WWI values. Compared to the group with the lowest scores, the other groups had higher stroke risks: 37% higher in the group with the second lowest values, and 38% higher in the group with the very highest values. This finding indicates that higher TyG-WWI values were consistently linked to a greater risk of stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also found a clear, linear relationship: as TyG-WWI values increased, so did stroke risk. This pattern was especially strong in younger participants and those without coronary heart disease. Other factors like sex, ethnicity, education and smoking or drinking habits didn’t significantly change this relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has a few limitations to consider before applying the findings to the general population. First, because it was based on data collected at a single point in time, it is not possible to determine whether higher TyG-WWI values directly cause an increased risk of stroke. To establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, future studies that follow participants over time are needed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, while we accounted for many factors that could influence the results, it’s possible that unknown factors still played a role, which the researchers couldn’t fully control for. Lastly, since this research focused on data from the U.S. population, it’s uncertain whether the findings apply to people in other countries. More studies are needed to confirm whether these results are consistent across different populations and settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The connection between the TyG-WWI index and stroke risk has real-world implications that could change how we approach stroke prevention. Think of the TyG-WWI index as a health "check engine" light; it combines key factors like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size to give a snapshot of your metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For health care providers, this could become a powerful tool to spot people at higher risk of stroke early, even before any warning signs appear. For the rest of us, it’s a wake-up call to pay attention to things like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management, blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and fat distribution. With obesity and metabolic concerns on the rise, this kind of early detection could make a significant difference in preventing strokes and improving recovery outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned about your own blood sugar or cholesterol levels, checking in with a healthcare professional can be a good first step. You can also try to shake up your routine to incorporate more exercise and more healthy meals. We love using short, adaptable meal plans—like our weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-insulin-resistance-11759777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No-Sugar High-Fiber Meal Plan for Insulin Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and our seven-day &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-fiber-no-sugar-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11775446" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;High-Fiber, No-Sugar Meal Plan for Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;—as a simple and delicious way to reset your routine and discover new recipes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the important role the TyG-WWI index could play in understanding and managing stroke risk. By combining key health markers like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size, this index offers a practical way to assess metabolic health and identify individuals who may be at higher risk of stroke. While more research is needed to confirm these findings across different populations and to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, the results are a step forward in improving how we approach stroke prevention.

The vaccines from Moderna are approved for children as young as 6 months, Pfizer for ages 5 years and up, and Novavax for those 12 years and older — but only for patients considered to be at higher risk. Parents are being told to consult with their doctors to determine eligibility, adding another layer of complexity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults over 65 will be able to get the vaccines without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; is expected to meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to recommend the updated COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach reflects a policy shift &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=4wz-6cMxurEYtiMNsYMFcw" data-link="native" class=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a May video, when Kennedy said the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children or pregnant people. The &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; broke from that guidance, recommending individuals get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.

He pointed to the federally funded Vaccines for Children &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccinesforchildren/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; that provides routine vaccinations for children on Medicaid. The program generally follows CDC guidance on what is considered a routine vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In California, over 50% of kids are on Medicaid, and they get their vaccines this way, and they might not be able to get them this year,” Ball said. “We already have a socioeconomic disparity … and now we’re going to put even more barriers on a lot of people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the hurdles, both doctors urged parents to turn to trusted health providers for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any family who wants to vaccinate their kid after conversations with their doctor should have the opportunity,” Ball said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong added that while the rollout has been chaotic, there is still some reassurance: “We will have a new vaccine this year, and the people who need it the most are going to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-4" data-large-id="Inline-6" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 23:59:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQRko1czMyb2U4UHRrakctbHZoeWwtaF9PN0tEd2NvNmFGUFhKRkJKSGEwZFN2VTItTl95TFVTY1cyNUs4dHRUWmhBT1hGR0RWcFJWMFRpYVNBbzVja1dCdmRWZmh3SUZVRGU1S0Y1ZUUzSVp4eUYtZjRfN2s3UUVxZ2tUazFla2EzYk1LVEdPZWxFSWVFcmtuN1M5ME00UQ</guid></item><item><title>您每天需要走多少路才能降低患心脏病的风险- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/preventing-heart-disease-walking-sc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Between work, errands, family obligations and household chores, life is busy. Taking time for yourself may not be feasible right now and that’s OK. If you can’t fit in the recommended 21 minutes of walking a day, start small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a quick one-minute jaunt pays off,” according to the report by Harvard Health. The report noted that a 2014 study from the University of Utah found that “for every minute of brisk walking that women did throughout the day, they lowered their risk of obesity by 5%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So start small. Task yourself with a minute-long walk down your driveway this afternoon, or take that 10-minute work check-in call as you walk around your block. No amount of time is too short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you feel ready, you can start to incorporate different walking distances and intensities, like speed changes and hills, Singh said. Both of these things, plus “maintaining a consistent habit will likely yield the biggest bang for its buck,” she explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/preventing-heart-disease-walking_l_62def5bae4b03dbb991be966" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7930552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The release says ketamine is a "non-narcotic medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, ketamine works by targeting glutamate receptors in the brain, leading to "rapid relief of depressive symptoms and promoting long-term healing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our goal is to offer more than hydration services—we want to be a wellness partner for the whole person,"  said Keith Parris, mental health provider and co-founder of Hydrate Medical and Derive Health. "Bringing ketamine therapy to Asheville gives us another tool to help people who feel like they've tried everything else."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the release, nearly 80% of treatment-resistant depression patients have reported significant improvement when using ketamine in a supportive therapeutic setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 23:09:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxNbHJacFZxeHhYV1JrVFlKaVBySkZDMExLM3ZIM0pEaEZlcktna3c0eGRBNjgyekcwa3pWRFZMUUY3VDZMYTU1X012Y0ZJOWEwOTZRRVFsbXdraGFQME45eE1id2ZBUnJXcjJ3NWJJY3lFUVFyMzZ4T0s5RFMwcUVBVkgxR0l3LVJFNE1FeG83MUptZ215T0FIUHd0UDF2cEVUYjh3OGl5bDRCdjhOa2tEVW5McW1kYUtQZlpzdjhuTldJcEQwNHMzNnpwc1dXTDMwUjVfLVBieFgtTTkwV2Q4VW83aG5haU1DTHhmdW00UW5zQmsxcXZMS1pldXZ3YmtqbFE</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，摄入更多这些营养素可以帮助您睡得更好- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/pufas-fatigue-sleep-study-11799046</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in Americans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found certain nutrients may help reduce EDS by improving sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include omega-6 fatty acids, found in nuts, seeds and fatty fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Americans have a sleep problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 40% of adults get &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which includes both quality and quantity of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can result in health issues, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also affects mental and emotional health, immunity and metabolism. And if you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re also likely to have excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because sleep issues are so pervasive, researchers from the U.S. and Finland joined forces to consider what might be behind 33% of U.S. adults having excessive daytime sleepiness. Specifically, they took a close look at metabolites, tiny molecules that are produced during metabolism, to see if there is any connection between them and sleep. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet’s eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was done in several parts with different analyses. For the first part, researchers drew data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). This was followed by replication analyses of three other studies: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and Health2000 studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Replication analyses are performed to try and replicate previously conducted studies and their results. The purpose of doing so is to test the strength of the findings and verify and confirm the results. This helps to ensure the reliability and consistency of the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were over 6,000 participants for the HCHS/SOL study with a Hispanic/Latino background who had the information the researchers were looking for, which included the results of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire. The ESS includes eight questions regarding the likelihood of dozing off during the day in various scenarios. Responses to each question are on a scale of 0 to 3, with the highest possible score of 24 and higher scores relating to higher sleepiness. A score of 11 and above are considered EDS.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other data researchers looked at were participants’ bloodwork, which included metabolomic measurements of the metabolites associated with sleep. Participants had filled out demographic and health information, including sleep duration, insomnia symptoms and diagnosis of sleep apnea. Participants had also reported dietary information, which was graded against the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 15% of the participants in the HCHS/SOL study were considered to have EDS; 58% of them were women. There was information on a total of 877 metabolites for each participant, which allowed researchers to analyze metabolite levels and how they might relate to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Higher ESS scores were associated with lower metabolite levels for seven metabolites across genders, plus an additional four in men. Among the seven metabolites were two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in foods like fatty fish, nuts and seeds, as well as seed oils, like canola and peanut oils. People with higher levels of PUFAs had less excessive daytime sleepiness.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers note that these foods—fish, nuts and seeds—are popular in the Mediterranean diet. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-diets-2025-8767671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has consistently ranked at the top of all the diets for years. This is because it prioritizes nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and fish. And it’s been linked with numerous health benefits, including a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-brain-age-study-8745764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthier brain&lt;/a&gt; and heart, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-arthritis-study-11740419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-mortality-study-11764737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;helping you live longer&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that people with higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets and blood have a lower risk of excessive daytime sleepiness. This is due to polyunsaturated fatty acids’ connection with better sleep. Work more of these healthy fats—found in fish, nuts and seeds—into your day and see if you sleep better at night.

Lee Jenkins, MD, an emergency medicine physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Worsening fatigue, leg swelling, unusual chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, nausea, and back or belly pain are all ways heart disease can present in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65370178/sleep-heart-health-menopause-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65370178/sleep-heart-health-menopause-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart disease" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; being the number one cause of death in women over 65, more men than women visit the emergency department for diseases of the circulatory system each year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/dhcs/ed-visits/index.htm" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/dhcs/ed-visits/index.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.3.0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is partly because many women don’t know the symptoms they are experiencing are from a cardiac event, says Eleni Horattas-Collins, MD, an emergency medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Sometimes women have back pain, and sometimes they just have shortness of breath, so they linger at home for a few days waiting for it to go away,” she says. “Once they come in, we realize that probably two or three days ago is when they had a significant event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You should also pay attention if any of these symptoms get worse with exertion, says Ariel Wu, MD, former chief resident of the UCLA Emergency Medicine program. If you're walking or you're doing some kind of activity, and it makes your pain or fatigue worse and doesn't get better with rest, that’s “a textbook sign of an impending heart attack or blockage in arteries,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Weakness On One Side Of Your Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The most common symptom of a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65614968/ozempic-stroke-risk-new-studies/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65614968/ozempic-stroke-risk-new-studies/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stroke" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; is the sudden onset of numbness or weakness in part of your body, like your face, arm, or leg—especially if it is just on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If you're having weakness on one side of your body, then there's no time to waste,” says Dr. Jenkins. “Go directly to an emergency department."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These symptoms can be coupled with sudden loss of vision, especially in one eye, and neurological symptoms like dizziness or room-spinning. Symptoms of a stroke are unique in that they come on very quickly, and sometimes, someone around you actually notices them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And, for what it’s worth: Just because you are experiencing these symptoms doesn’t mean you are having a stroke. Women often get atypical migraines, which can mimic the symptoms of a stroke, Dr. Wu says. You may also be experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850199/hailey-bieber-mini-stroke-heart-surgery-youtube-video/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850199/hailey-bieber-mini-stroke-heart-surgery-youtube-video/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mini-stroke" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;mini-stroke&lt;/a&gt;, which means the symptoms are temporary and will go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that’s not your job to figure out. “Don't worry about differentiating them,” Dr. Wu says. “Just get to the emergency department, and they'll take it from there.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Heavy Vaginal Bleeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you are experiencing abnormally &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65889912/fibroids-diagnosis-questions/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65889912/fibroids-diagnosis-questions/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heavy bleeding" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heavy bleeding&lt;/a&gt; during your period or passing large clots of blood (think: bigger than the size of a grape, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="289ecc2f-c285-4357-97b6-9c3a79e3451a" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="21.3" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand="Privacy Policy" data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="44dbae7f-4561-4810-847d-908a6b1638b6" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Privacy Policy" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.3.0"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you should head to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;How do you know if you’re bleeding more than usual? Pay attention to how many pads or tampons you’re going through. If you’re using more than you typically would, that’s one sign, Dr. Horattas-Collins. An elevated heart rate or lightheadedness can also signal that you’ve lost a significant amount of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“[The emergency room] is never the wrong place to go."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Losing that much blood puts you at risk of hypovolemic shock, which occurs when the body doesn’t have enough blood to circulate oxygen and nutrients to your organs. This can be prevented by a simple blood transfusion in the emergency room, or sometimes a small gynecological procedure is necessary to prevent future blood loss, Dr. Jenkins says.&lt;br data-node-id="24.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Plus, if there is any possibility that you are pregnant and you are experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially if it is coupled with abdominal pain, it is important to come to the emergency room to ensure you are not having an ectopic pregnancy, Dr. Wu says. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a pregnancy occurs outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube, and can be life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;Pain, Heavy Bleeding, Or Leg Swelling During Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As many people who have been pregnant know, different side effects come up during a pregnancy; often ones that can be handled with your OB-GYN at your check-ups. However, some symptoms, like severe abdominal pain and cramping, heavy vaginal bleeding, or a fever, are definitely worthy of going to the emergency room for an ultrasound, says Dr. Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Another symptom to look out for during pregnancy is leg swelling because this can be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="preeclampsia" data-vars-ga-product-id="b5b4e3f3-bb13-499d-a381-b34e4f8bad87" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="28.1" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="d5a141fa-9a3c-4b14-baa2-fa45b68f36fa" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt;, she says. Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the mother’s blood pressure rises during pregnancy. It is important to go to the emergency room so doctors can assess you and the baby, and help monitor blood pressure going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="29" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Heavy Bleeding, Lightheadedness, Or Surgery Complications Post-Delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you are experiencing heavy bleeding or lightheadedness after birth, you should go to the emergency room, Dr. Jenkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Heavy bleeding after a vaginal birth could be a sign that not all of the placenta and fetal tissue passed during the birth, according to a 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://www.jucm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-19821-27-Clinical.pdf" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jucm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-19821-27-Clinical.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="31.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.1.0.0"&gt;The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Doctors will do an ultrasound to determine if this is the case, and can treat the condition with antibiotics or small gynecological procedures to remove the remaining tissue and stop the bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It is also important to remember that giving birth is a big deal and your body needs to recover, especially if you had a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34618144/lindsay-arnold-cesarean-section-video/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34618144/lindsay-arnold-cesarean-section-video/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cesarean section" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cesarean section&lt;/a&gt;. Many new parents get caught up in the chaos of a newborn baby, so they don’t remember to check the surgical site in the days following their C-section, Dr. Jenkins says. If the site is red and swollen, or you have a fever, it could be a sign of an infection that needs immediate care, Dr. Jenkins says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="34" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;An Injury You Can’t Bear Weight On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you can’t bear weight on an injury, it’s a sign you broke a bone. While many urgent cares have X-rays, they are not always read by radiologists, Dr. Jenkins says, so the ER has a leg up when it comes to helping treat you. The ER can do X-rays and advanced imaging, like a CT scan, to show bone fractures that might not even show up on a regular X-ray. The ER can also do advanced splinting techniques to set your broken bone and can get you a consultation with orthopedic doctors attached to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You should also go to the ER if you are experiencing any neurological or vascular symptoms in your possibly broken limb, Dr. Horattas-Collins adds. “For example, if your arm is broken and you can't feel anything in your hand, or you’re not getting a pulse in your hand, that’s emergency level,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="37" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;Bleeding That Won’t Stop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many cuts and scrapes can be managed at urgent care. Even if you need a few stitches, the doctors there should be able to do all sorts of basic laceration repairs, Dr. Wu says. However, if you have a cut that just won’t seem to stop bleeding, it’s a good idea to go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She also recommends coming to the emergency room if you have a cut or scrape in a sensitive area, like your hand or face, that you are worried won’t heal on its own. This way you can get specialized care to prevent scarring and immobility as best you can.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="40" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;Signs Of A Head Injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Head injuries are serious, and if you have signs of a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63545678/concussions-in-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63545678/concussions-in-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="concussion" data-node-id="41.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; after hitting your head—like losing consciousness, nausea, bruising, or neck pain—you should definitely get it checked out at the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It is also important to mention if you take any blood thinners to your doctor when you present with a head injury, as this increases the likelihood of a brain bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="44" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Regardless of immediate reactions, make sure to monitor symptoms of a head injury for the first 24 to 36 hours after it occurs. Sometimes concussions reveal themselves as time goes on, so be on the lookout for a new headache, nausea, vomiting, or confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="45" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="45.0"&gt;If You Feel Like A Danger To Yourself Or Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People don’t traditionally think of the emergency room as a place to go for mental health concerns, but if you are worried about hurting yourself or hurting those around you, it is a safe place to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If you're feeling suicidal and you have a plan to hurt yourself, or maybe you're feeling unsafe with others, just go to an emergency department,” Dr. Wu says. “They will figure it out and bring you to the right place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="48" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some emergency departments are part of hospitals with psychiatric departments or behavioral health teams that can work with patients to create a long-term plan for mental health care. They also might have a social work team to assist with other circumstances that can contribute to mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even if the emergency room you end up at doesn’t have these services on site, they will know who to call to help you get the care you need. They can also help you figure out how to get help if you feel like you are in an unsafe domestic situation or an unsafe relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="51" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“It’s never the wrong place to go,” Dr. Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="er-or-urgent-care" data-node-id="52" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="52.0"&gt;ER or urgent care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Experiencing a symptom not on this list and unsure about whether it’s ER-worthy or just requires a trip to your local urgent care? When thinking about whether or not you need to go to the emergency room, think about your condition in terms of chronicity and acuity, says Dr. Wu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="54" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.0.0"&gt;If you are concerned about a low-severity symptom related to a chronic condition&lt;/strong&gt; (for example, you suffer from migraines and are feeling the pain in a different spot than you usually do), you can bring it up with your primary care physician or specialized provider. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.1.0"&gt;If you are dealing with a chronic condition and experience a sudden, acute spike in symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, you should go to the emergency room. “For example, some people have chronic pain that they’re on six different medications for, but suddenly the pain has gotten so bad that you can't eat, can't sleep, can't walk,” Dr. Wu says. “Please come to the emergency department.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.2.0"&gt;If an issue is low chronicity, meaning it’s acute, and low severity&lt;/strong&gt;—like a sore throat, a pain in your ear, or discomfort when you pee—go to urgent care. It’s the perfect place to go if you want immediate care, but are not worried that your life is in danger. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.3.0"&gt;If you’re experiencing an acute symptom that is severe&lt;/strong&gt;, go to the emergency room. “The party line is, if you think that you need to be evaluated in the emergency department, we always recommend that you err on the side of caution and come to the emergency department,” Dr. Horattas-Collins says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="55" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Plus, keep in mind, going to your primary care doc regularly might lower your risk of going to either the ER or urgent care. 40 percent of ER visits are preventable, according to a 2018 study in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6004969/#:~:text=Results,associated%20with%20potentially%20preventable%20events." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6004969/#:~:text=Results,associated%20with%20potentially%20preventable%20events." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Permanente Journal" data-node-id="55.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="55.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="55.1.0.0"&gt;Permanente Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Preventive care is so important,” Dr. Wu says. “In the emergency department, we really lean on our outpatient and primary care to do the things that we can't do. We might be able to pull you back from the cliff when you're there, but it'd be great if we didn't approach it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="56" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Obviously, emergencies &lt;em data-node-id="56.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; pop up and not everyone has the resources for consistent primary care. You know your body better than anyone else and, when something feels seriously wrong, trust your instincts. It’s better to spend a little extra time in the ER waiting room than to ignore a serious symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img data-dynamic-svg="true" src="/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/logos/lettermark.f613c4d.svg?primary=%2523000" loading="lazy" data-testid="dynamic-svg-base" alt="Lettermark" class="css-7mevzh ev8dhu50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sela Breen (she/her) is the 2024 summer editorial intern at &lt;em&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt;.

It can also involve differences in the way you move and walk – known as your “&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357844247_Gait_analysis_overview_trends_and_challenges"&gt;gait&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an “odd gait” is now listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a &lt;a href="https://a4.org.au/book/export/html/1568#:%7E:text=Associated%20Features%20Supporting%20Diagnosis&amp;amp;text=Even%20those%20with%20average%20or,greatest%20in%20the%20adolescent%20years."&gt;supporting diagnostic feature&lt;/a&gt; of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable gait differences among autistic people are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;toe-walking, walking on the balls of the feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in-toeing, walking with one or both feet turned inwards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;out-toeing, walking with one or both feet turned out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also identified more subtle differences. A study summarising &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/aur.2443"&gt;30 years of research among autistic people reports&lt;/a&gt; that gait is characterised by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;walking more slowly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;taking wider steps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;spending longer in the “stance” phase, when the foot leaves the ground&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;taking more time to complete each step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people show much more &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/aur.2443"&gt;personal variability&lt;/a&gt; in the length and speed of their strides, as well as their walking speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gait differences also tend to occur alongside other motor differences, such as issues with balance, coordination, postural stability and handwriting. Autistic people &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20195737/"&gt;may need support&lt;/a&gt; for these other motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes gait differences?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are largely due to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/592653"&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/580155"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in areas known as the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/developmental-medicine-and-child-neurology/article/abs/gait-function-in-newly-diagnosed-children-with-autism-cerebellar-and-basal-ganglia-related-motor-disorder/FE4B64AB25C010412AF00904E20E3FFB"&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-006-0530-y"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basal ganglia are &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mds.870130310"&gt;broadly responsible&lt;/a&gt; for sequencing movement including through shifting posture. It ensures your gait appears effortless, smooth and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum then uses visual and proprioceptive information (to sense the body’s position and movement) to adjust and time movements to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1073858404263517"&gt;maintain postural stability&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1080/14734220601187741"&gt;ensures&lt;/a&gt; movement is controlled and coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developmental differences in these brain regions &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16182941/"&gt;relate&lt;/a&gt; to the way the areas look (their structure), how they work (their function and activation) and how they “speak” to other areas of the brain (their connections).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some researchers have suggested that autistic gait occurs due to delayed development, we now know gait differences persist across the lifespan. Some differences actually become &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/aur.2443"&gt;clearer with age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to brain-based differences, the autistic gait is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946724001326"&gt;associated with&lt;/a&gt; factors such as the person’s broader motor, language and cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with more complex support needs might have more pronounced gait or motor differences, together with language and cognitive difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor dysregulation &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/integrative-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnint.2025.1634265/full"&gt;might indicate sensory or cognitive overload&lt;/a&gt; and be a useful marker that the person might benefit from extra support or a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is it managed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all differences need to be treated. Instead, clinicians take an individualised and goals-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some autistic people might have subtle gait differences that are observable during testing. But if these differences don’t impact a person’s ability to participate in everyday life, they don’t require support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autistic person is likely to benefit from support for gait differences if they have a functional impact on their daily life. This might include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;increased risk of, or frequent, falls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;difficulty participating in the physical activities they enjoy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;physical consequences such as tightness of the Achilles and calf muscles, or associated pain in other areas, such as the feet or back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some children may also benefit from support for motor skill development. However this doesn’t have to occur in a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given children spend a large portion of their time at school, programs that integrate opportunities for movement throughout the school day allow autistic children to develop motor skills outside of the clinic and alongside peers. We developed the &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/psych/research/neurodevelopment/allplay-child-and-family-program/joy-of-moving-program-in-australia"&gt;Joy of Moving Program in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which gets students moving in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175094672300171X"&gt;community-based intervention studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-021-04933-w"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; autistic children’s movement abilities can improve after engaging in community-based interventions, such as sports or dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-based support models empower autistic children to have agency in how they move, rather than seeing different ways of moving as a problem to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where to from here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have learnt a lot about autistic gait at a broad level, researchers and clinicians are still seeking a better understanding of why and when individual variability occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also still determining how to best support individual movement styles, including among children as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However there is &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pediatrics/articles/10.3389/fped.2025.1475019/full"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that physical activity enhances social skills and behavioural regulation in preschool children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s encouraging that states and territories are moving towards more &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-reform-the-ndis-and-better-support-disabled-people-who-dont-qualify-for-it-258799"&gt;community-based foundational supports&lt;/a&gt; for autistic children and their peers, as governments develop supports outside the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors thank the late &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/vale/home/articles/vale-emeritus-professor-johnson-lockyer-bradshaw"&gt;Emeritus Professor John Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt; for his early input into this piece.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/231685/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/231685/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pickles can be polarizing—most people either love them or leave them on the side of the plate. And ideally, those two people dine together, because getting an extra pickle with your sandwich is a win (speaking from experience). But beyond their salty and tangy flavor, do pickles actually offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-for-gut-health-8574817" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;? The answer depends on how they are made. Here’s how to identify whether or not your pickles fit that bill. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-a-food-gut-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes a Food Gut-Healthy?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, two nutrients often come up: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotics are a type of fiber that feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, while probiotics are living microbes that help support a healthy and diverse microbiome. Therefore, a food that contains either or both of these can make it beneficial for your gut. Plus, gut-healthy foods not only support your gut health, but also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;benefit your body as a whole&lt;/a&gt;, from your brain to your heart and even your immune system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, do pickles fall into these categories? It depends on the type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fermented-vs-non-fermented-pickles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Fermented vs. Non-Fermented Pickles &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fermented Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might surprise you to hear that the original pickles were fermented. In fact, fermented pickles have become so popular that they remain a staple in many cuisines worldwide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fermented pickles are made by submerging them in a saltwater brine (plus any additional desired seasonings) and leaving them at room temperature. Many recipes are measured by the weight of each ingredient used, and recommend adding 2 to 5% salt by weight compared to the weight of water that’s used. This salt percentage creates a safe environment for beneficial microbes to flourish, while keeping harmful ones at bay. Over time, generally after one to two weeks, these good bacteria produce lactic acid, which gives fermented pickles their signature tangy flavor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These beneficial bacteria not only add great flavor to fermented pickles but also provide gut-healthy probiotics. And cucumbers aren’t the only veggie that can be fermented: cabbage (hello, sauerkraut) and radishes (a staple in some Korean kimchi) also benefit from this process.  You can make fermented pickles at home using proper sanitation practices and techniques, or  look for them at some grocery stores (check the refrigerated aisles if you’re having a hard time finding them). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these types of pickles are rich in probiotics, they can be relatively low in fiber depending on the vegetable you use. Cucumbers, for example, only contain 1 gram of fiber per ½ cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Non-Fermented Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most pickles you’ll find on the shelves are not fermented. These are typically made by adding the cucumbers to a tangy, vinegar-based brine. Adding vinegar to the vegetables helps to preserve them and create the desired pickled flavor, but it inhibits the growth of bacteria needed for fermentation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Non-fermented pickles are also typically stored in the refrigerator below 40℉, which is a temperature where fermentation can’t occur.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that non-fermented pickles won’t contain gut-healthy probiotics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about prebiotics? The amount of prebiotic fiber in cucumber pickles is relatively low, as the lack of fermentation does not alter their fiber content. However, other pickled vegetables, like carrots and green beans, may offer slightly more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, pickled vegetables aren’t the only source of prebiotics. Foods like potatoes, oats, garlic and artichokes offer more prebiotics and better support to your gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While non-fermented pickles can be a delicious addition to your diet, they are less likely to offer gut-health benefits when compared to fermented pickles. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-choosing-gut-healthy-pickles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Choosing Gut-Healthy Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy pickles, they can absolutely be part of your healthy eating pattern. Here’s what to look for when shopping for pickles: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the Ingredients List&lt;/strong&gt;: Fermented pickles should contain just the vegetable, salt, water and any seasonings used. If the ingredients list includes vinegar, it’s not fermented. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Out for the Sodium&lt;/strong&gt;: Regardless of whether they are fermented or not, most pickles are high in sodium. That’s due to the salt that’s added for preservation and flavoring. Most Americans consume too much sodium in their daily diets, and excessive sodium intake can lead to long-term health consequences, including high blood pressure and adverse effects on gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When choosing pickles, compare labels to find a lower-sodium option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While some pickles can offer impressive gut-health benefits, not all pickles are made in the same way. If gut health is your goal, opt for fermented pickles rather than non-fermented pickles since they contain probiotics (good-for-you bacteria). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both types of pickles are usually high in sodium, so it’s wise to look at the labels and opt for those with lower sodium content. Research has shown that high sodium intake can increase the risk of high blood pressure and can lead to adverse effects on the gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And for some, high-acid, high-sodium foods like pickles could lead to unpleasant digestive symptoms like reflux or bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, any type of pickle can fit into a healthy eating pattern if you enjoy them. And let’s be honest, they’re downright delicious, which is a good enough reason to enjoy them on occasion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 21:22:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE96WDRFVlJvS19qZ3pPYXo0bXVrTWRCdkg1TkZ6R0NtaGdFN01iRkVpQnYtYWpvenczdmg4MnF2Qk1oNnYwejIxUXZCcklGTkJXS2hRSGFCLWlSQklmVExtaFVDdkRjYTlFQ05B</guid></item><item><title>如果您年满65岁，仍然可以每天早上做这8件事，那么您的健康就在顶级- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-youre-over-65-and-can-still-do-these-8-things-every-morning-your-health-is-in-the-top-tier/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="417" data-end="592"&gt;A lot of people treat aging like a downhill slope. But the truth is, if you’re over 65 and can still handle certain everyday habits with ease, you’re doing better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="594" data-end="782"&gt;It’s not about being able to run marathons or bench-press your body weight. The real markers of strong health are often tucked into the little things we do in the first hours of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="784" data-end="951"&gt;Morning routines reveal a lot. They test your balance, flexibility, cognition, energy, and even emotional health—all before you’ve finished your first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="953" data-end="1065"&gt;Let’s break down eight simple morning abilities that reveal more about your health than any number on a chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1072" data-end="1109"&gt;1. Get out of bed without effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1111" data-end="1288"&gt;Let’s start simple. If you can swing your legs out of bed and stand up without groaning, holding onto a dresser, or taking forever to find your balance, you’re in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1290" data-end="1505"&gt;Mobility and muscle strength naturally decline with age, but being able to rise smoothly from lying down is a powerful indicator of overall fitness. It shows your core, balance, and joints are all working in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1507" data-end="1685"&gt;I remember staying with my grandfather in his late 70s—he never needed to “psych himself up” to get out of bed. He’d just get up, stretch, and move on. That’s health in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;Physiotherapists often use simple functional tasks—like getting out of bed or rising from the floor—as quick gauges of mobility and independence. Studies show that&lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/srff/deBrito-Floor-Rise-Mortality-2012..pdf?.com"&gt; difficulty with these movements&lt;/a&gt; correlates with higher mortality risk and functional dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;As one geriatric physical therapist put it: “The way someone gets out of bed is the way they’ll likely handle the rest of the day.” If it’s smooth and strong, you’re setting a solid tone for your morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2007" data-end="2036"&gt;2. Recall what day it is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2038" data-end="2213"&gt;Sounds small, right? But it’s actually huge. Waking up and immediately knowing the day, where you are, and what’s on your schedule is a sign your cognitive health is intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2215" data-end="2427"&gt;Neurologists often use orientation—&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-loss-and-forgetfulness/memory-problems-forgetfulness-and-aging?.com"&gt;assessing awareness&lt;/a&gt; of time, place, person, and situation—as a quick check of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2429" data-end="2612"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging points out, “Cognitive changes are a normal part of aging, but significant memory loss is not.” Waking up clear-minded already gives you an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;I once stayed with a family friend in Spain who was in her 80s. Every morning, she would look at the calendar pinned to her fridge and say out loud, “It’s Wednesday, I have market today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;It wasn’t because she was forgetful—it was because she liked reinforcing clarity. And she never missed a detail. That small act reflected how intact her mental sharpness was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2985" data-end="3025"&gt;3. Get dressed without needing help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3027" data-end="3182"&gt;Pulling on a pair of pants, fastening buttons, or slipping on shoes doesn’t sound like much—but it actually requires flexibility, dexterity, and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3446"&gt;When I was traveling in Japan, I noticed how older adults there often prided themselves on maintaining independence in daily activities. They saw being able to dress themselves as a core part of dignity. And they weren’t wrong—it’s an underrated health marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3448" data-end="3664"&gt;If you can manage your clothing without getting tangled up or losing your footing, you’re keeping independence alive. It’s also a subtle sign that arthritis or other mobility-limiting conditions haven’t taken over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3666" data-end="3950"&gt;And here’s the thing: small motor skills like buttoning a shirt are actually &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00910/full?.com"&gt;linked to brain health&lt;/a&gt; too. Fine motor control requires coordination between your nervous system and muscles. If you can manage it seamlessly, it’s a two-for-one check of physical and cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3957" data-end="4015"&gt;4. Walk to the kitchen without aches slowing you down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4017" data-end="4182"&gt;Can you make it from the bedroom to the kitchen with a steady pace, without joints locking up or pain forcing you to stop? If so, your mobility is in the top tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4184" data-end="4419"&gt;Walking is one of those things most of us take for granted until it’s gone. Morning movement without discomfort means your joints are holding up, your circulation is working, and your heart is strong enough to handle simple exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4421" data-end="4663"&gt;Doctors often use the “timed up and go” test to measure mobility in older adults. It’s exactly what it sounds like: stand up, walk a short distance, turn, and sit back down. If you can do that easily in the morning, you’re beating the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4665" data-end="4993"&gt;When I spent a summer in Lisbon, I’d often see groups of older locals walking briskly to the café first thing in the morning. No limping, no hesitation—just a steady stride. They weren’t walking for exercise, they were walking for life. That’s what good health really looks like: the freedom to move without thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5000" data-end="5031"&gt;5. Make yourself breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5033" data-end="5153"&gt;Cooking—even something simple like oatmeal or toast—requires a blend of fine motor skills, problem-solving, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5155" data-end="5362"&gt;You’re standing, moving, stirring, maybe slicing some fruit. That’s coordination and stability at work. Plus, there’s the decision-making part: choosing what to eat, prepping it, and cleaning up afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5364" data-end="5620"&gt;As geriatric specialists note, “Instrumental activities of daily living” (things like cooking or managing finances) are some of the best measures of functional independence. If breakfast isn’t a challenge, your brain and body are cooperating beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5622" data-end="5840"&gt;There’s also something deeper here: the ritual of making food signals you’re still engaged with life. You’re not just grabbing whatever’s easiest—you’re participating in your own well-being. And that mindset matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5847" data-end="5889"&gt;6. Use technology without frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5891" data-end="6027"&gt;Checking your phone, texting a grandchild, or skimming the news on a tablet might not seem like health markers, but they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6029" data-end="6227"&gt;Tech use relies on memory (remembering how apps work), motor skills (swiping, typing), and vision. Being able to handle this fluidly means you’ve kept pace with both cognitive and sensory demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6229" data-end="6452"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another piece: adaptability is one of the most overlooked signs of mental resilience. If you’re still adapting to new tools and apps, it’s a very good sign you’re keeping your brain flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6718"&gt;As psychologist Carol Dweck noted, “Becoming is better than being.” The willingness to learn—even when it’s something as simple as figuring out how to adjust text size on your phone—signals a growth mindset. And that mindset is a powerful buffer against decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6725" data-end="6764"&gt;7. Do light exercise or stretching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6766" data-end="6908"&gt;If your morning includes even a few minutes of stretching, yoga, or a quick walk around the block, you’re investing in your future mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6910" data-end="7120"&gt;Exercise isn’t just about fitness—it keeps bones strong, maintains balance, and lowers the risk of falls. &lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;Long-term, moderate-intensity, multicomponent exercise (combining strength, balance, and flexibility) is shown to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2719424?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 34%&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7122" data-end="7414"&gt;I once stayed in a small town in Italy where older folks met in the town square to do stretches together before heading off to errands. Some used canes, some didn’t. But they all showed up daily. The community, the movement, the routine—it all worked together to keep them sharp and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7416" data-end="7528"&gt;If your morning involves intentional movement, you’re stacking the odds in your favor for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7535" data-end="7569"&gt;8. Feel ready to face the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7571" data-end="7763"&gt;Here’s one that’s less physical and more about energy and mood. If you wake up with enough mental drive to look forward to the day ahead—rather than dreading it—you’re doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7765" data-end="7900"&gt;Morning vitality reflects both mental and physical well-being. Sleep quality, emotional health, and energy balance all converge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7902" data-end="8113"&gt;Experts like Dr. Andrew Huberman highlight how early-day light exposure and &lt;a href="https://biologyinsights.com/andrew-huberman-articles-where-to-find-his-content/?.com"&gt;structured morning routines&lt;/a&gt; help regulate the nervous system, setting emotional tone and cognitive clarity for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;And here’s the kicker: purpose plays into this too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;A recent study published in the &lt;em data-start="84" data-end="126"&gt;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; tracked over 13,000 adults aged 45+ for up to 15 years and found that those with a strong sense of purpose were &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-simple-daily-habit-can-protect-the-brain-from-dementia/photostory/123518852.cms?.com"&gt;28% less likely to develop cognitive impairments like dementia&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for education and genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;So if you’re waking up motivated, it’s not just mood—it’s a real health advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8406" data-end="8426"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8428" data-end="8583"&gt;Health over 65 isn’t about comparing yourself to twenty-year-olds—it’s about sustaining independence, energy, and clarity in the things that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8585" data-end="8770"&gt;If you can get up, get dressed, move around, think clearly, make breakfast, use a bit of tech, stretch, and feel energized—all before noon—you’re not just doing fine. You’re thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8772" data-end="8817"&gt;And that, in my book, is the real top tier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are mostly but not entirely human. If we crunch the numbers, 8% of your genome actually comes from viruses that got stranded there. This viral detritus is a souvenir from our evolutionary past, a reminder that viruses have been with us from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Usually, this 8% of your DNA—the viral bits—are kept silent. Scientists call it part of the "dark matter" in your genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now scientists at La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) have published a first look at a key viral protein. In a study published in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady8168" target="_blank"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, LJI researchers revealed the first three-dimensional structure of a protein from one of these ancient "human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team mapped the surface envelope glycoprotein (Env), the antibody target of the most active HERV, marking a milestone in structural biology. "This is the first human HERV protein structure ever solved—and only the third retroviral envelope structure solved overall, after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)," says Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA, LJI President, CEO, and Professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens the door to new strategies for diagnosing and treating disease. Back in the evolutionary past, HERV-K Env proteins studded the outside of the HERV-K retroviruses. But in modern humans, HERV-K Env proteins show up on the surface of certain tumor cells and in patients with autoimmune and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/neurodegenerative+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, making them a valuable target for developing novel diagnostics and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In many disease states, like &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autoimmune+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; and cancer, these genes re-awaken and start making pieces of these viruses," says Saphire. "Understanding the HERV-K Env structure, and the antibodies we now have, opens up diagnostic and treatment opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected 'twist'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, HERV proteins had been invisible. They've proven too mobile—and too twitchy—to be seen with even the most sophisticated imaging techniques. Solving the structure of HERV-K Env was especially challenging because the LJI team needed to capture the protein's delicate "pre-fusion" state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envelope proteins are full of potential energy—they're essentially spring-loaded to merge with a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/host+cell/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;host cell&lt;/a&gt; to start the infection process. This means pre-fusion proteins are prone to spontaneous switching to their later, post-fusion state. "You can look at them funny, and they'll unfold," says LJI Postdoctoral Fellow Jeremy Shek, who spearheaded the study as co-first author with LJI Postdoctoral Fellow Chen Sun, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the three-dimensional structure of HERV-K Env, the researchers introduced small substitutions to lock the protein's structure in place, while preserving its natural shape. Saphire and her team have used this approach before to reveal the structures of key proteins on Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and more. The researchers also discovered and characterized specific antibodies that helped anchor different versions of the viral proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stabilizing their HERV-K Env structures, the LJI team used a high-resolution imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to capture 3D images of HERV-K Env at three key moments: cell surface, in the act of driving infection, and when it locks together with antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many viral envelope glycoproteins have a trimer structure, but HERV-K Env is different from anything scientists had seen before, including trimers from other retroviruses. Unlike the shorter, squatter trimers made by HIV and SIV, the HERV-K Env is tall and lean. Further, the protein's fold—the weaving together of strands and coils that build the working machine—is unlike any other retrovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A new path for clinical research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new LJI study opens the door to using HERV-K Env to our advantage. Understanding the HERV-K Env structure, and how antibodies target it, may prove useful for developing diagnostic tools or new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, many types of cancer cells—from breast cancers to ovarian cancers—but not healthy cells, are dotted with HERV-K Env proteins. This means antibodies against HERV could distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells. As Sun explains, scientists could develop cancer immunotherapies that zero in on HERV-K Env to track down tumor cells. "We can use it as a strategy to specifically target cancer cells," says Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis also express HERV-K Env on their cells. Some scientists suspect that patients' immune cells see these strange proteins and think the body is under attack. Just like during a normal viral infection, their B cells start making antibodies against HERV-K Env proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how antibodies recognize these proteins was challenging because there was no structure and precious few good antibodies yet available," says Saphire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the LJI team made their own panel of antibodies to reveal how the immune system can target the different subunits of the molecule in all its different shapes. Once scientists understand how these antibody attacks work, they can try to intervene and stop harmful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also tested the idea that their antibodies may also be useful tools for diagnosing many autoimmune diseases. They used the antibodies to try and hunt down immune cells in samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. When Saphire and her colleagues tagged these antibodies with a molecular flag, they were able to quickly detect HERV-K Env on neutrophils, a type of immune cell that can cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These antibodies marked aberrant HERV display on neutrophils from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients, but not healthy controls," says Saphire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in HERVs is quickly growing, and scientists are finding more and more diseases where HERV-K Env crops up. "We can really pick whatever disease we're interested in and go down that route," says Shek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These projects may someday advance clinical care—and our fundamental understanding of human biology. After all, we're all part virus. It's time to get to know that part of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Across 124 patients followed for up to 18 months, participants consistently reported improved sleep quality, less anxiety and depression, and a better overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients also noted reduced pain, while side effects remained mild and manageable. Though randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness, the findings point to medical cannabis as a possible option when conventional therapies fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep quality improved and lasted for 18 months of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients also reported lower anxiety, depression, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild Side Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 9% experienced fatigue, dry mouth, or insomnia, with no serious events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insomnia patients taking cannabis-based medical products reported better quality sleep after up to 18 months of treatment, according to a study published August 27 in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; by Arushika Aggarwal from Imperial College London, U.K., and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one out of every three people has some trouble getting a good night’s rest, and 10 percent of adults meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder. But current treatments can be difficult to obtain, and the drugs approved for insomnia run the risk of dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how cannabis-based medical products might affect insomnia symptoms, the authors of this study analyzed a set of 124 insomnia patients taking medical cannabis products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They examined the patient’s reports of their sleep quality, anxiety/depression, and quality of life changes between one and 18 months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients reported improved sleep quality that lasted over the 18 months of treatment. They also showed significant improvements in anxiety/depression as well as reporting less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About nine percent of the patients reported adverse effects such as fatigue, insomnia, or dry mouth, but none of the side effects were life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While randomized controlled trials will be needed to prove that the products are safe and effective, the authors suggest that cannabis-based medical products could improve sleep quality in insomnia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Simon Erridge, Research Director at Curaleaf Clinic, summarizes: “Over an 18-month period, our study showed that treatment for insomnia with cannabis-based medicinal products was associated with sustained improvements in subjective sleep quality and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the potential role of medical cannabis as a medical option where conventional treatments have proven ineffective, though further randomised trials are needed to confirm long-term efficacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “Conducting this long-term study provided valuable real-world evidence on patient outcomes that go beyond what we typically see in short-term trials. It was particularly interesting to observe signs of potential tolerance over time, which highlights the importance of continued monitoring and individualised treatment plans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and insomnia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b76716b697e68685b6b7774683574697c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Bhaskar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Bhaskar – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UK Medical Cannabis Registry: A clinical outcomes analysis for insomnia&lt;/a&gt;” by Arushika Aggarwal et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOs Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK Medical Cannabis Registry: A clinical outcomes analysis for insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia affects approximately 10% of adults globally. Current treatments have their limitations, and there is growing evidence on the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicinal products for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess changes in sleep-specific and general patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in individuals prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products for insomnia and to assess the incidence of adverse events. A case series was analysed with patients diagnosed with primary insomnia from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry (UKMCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome examined changes in the Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Changes in PROMs were assessed from baseline to 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 18-months. Adverse events were classified according to the CTCAE version 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria were met by 124 participants. SQS scores showed improvement from baseline (2.66 ± 2.41) to 1- (5.67 ± 2.65; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 3- (5.41 ± 2.69; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 6- (4.80 ± 2.89; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 12- (4.24 ± 3.01; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 18-months (3.81 ± 2.90; p &amp;lt; 0.001). GAD-7 scores improved from baseline to 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 18-months (p &amp;lt; 0.050).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also improvements in EQ-5D-5L dimensions of usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and index values (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Eleven (8.87%) participants reported a total of 112 (90.32%) adverse events, but none were disabling or life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrated improvements in subjective sleep quality and other captured PROMs in insomnia patients treated with cannabis-based medicinal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the treatment was generally well-tolerated, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicinal products.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 20:34:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE82SnU1VzZrNU0zOGYzemxOU1hWTDlIbmdBVUU0cFVINndGQ2h4UTFqa0dpVFVVc0gyNncyX296ZXBBUXYwcDBmNlZLWHdfSnFjYWZPREJ5WFhERzlhUVdyaUs1UGtjbHN2djU5MjdB</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减了食品安全监测，现在仅跟踪8个主要感染中的2个- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/cdc-stopped-actively-tracking-6-foodborne-infections-amid-budget-cuts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;In July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dramatically, but quietly, scaled back a food safety surveillance system, cutting active tracking from eight top foodborne infections down to just two, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089"&gt;according to a report by NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)—a network of surveillance sites that spans 10 states and covers about 54 million Americans (16 percent of the US population)—previously included active monitoring for eight infections from pathogens. Those include &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cyclosporiasis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyclospora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/"&gt;Shiga toxin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (STEC), &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yersinia/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the network is only monitoring for STEC and &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of talking points the CDC sent the Connecticut health department (which is part of FoodNet) suggested that a lack of funding is behind the scaleback. "Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens," the CDC document said, according to NBC. The Trump administration has made brutal cuts to federal agencies, including the CDC, which has lost hundreds of employees this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told the outlet that "Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent. Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities."&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, there are &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/nutrition/cortisol-cocktails-49409551"&gt;cortisol cocktails&lt;/a&gt;, cortisol workouts, &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/health/cortisol-face-personal-essay-49382385"&gt;cortisol face&lt;/a&gt;, and so many other trends associated with the hormone — but cortisol itself is something that affects your health in a real way (although how is a bit misleading on social media).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Cortisol, aka the stress hormone, can play an important role in blood pressure regulation, body temperature, inflammation and so much more, as Akua Ampadu, MD, board-certified internal medicine physician and advisory board member for PS's Condition Center, &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/health/balancing-cortisol-levels-49361922"&gt;told Popsugar in a previous article.&lt;/a&gt; After learning about how important cortisol is for a variety of health reasons, I decided to track my cortisol throughout the day. I knew from previous testing with my doc that my cortisol levels were previously off, and I was curious to see where they would fall now. The results? Well, let's just say that I've already started to tweak my habits thanks to the surprising results. More below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cortisol 101 &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;As mentioned above, cortisol follows a pattern through the day, so when you measure your cortisol you have to also put it into context around your cortisol curve and the time of day you take it. So for example, one result in the morning can be considered "good," but getting that same result at night is not. Let me break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="4"&gt;Your cortisol levels are meant to follow a natural rhythm or curve. They should be highest in the morning when you wake up which gives you the energy to start your day, explains Marina Pavlovic Rivas, CEO and Co-Founder, &lt;a href="http://eli.health/?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49456942__t_w_" target="_blank" class="has-affiliate-link"&gt;Eli Health&lt;/a&gt;. Then, cortisol levels should naturally decline over the day, and be lowest at night. Before, when my doctor tracked my levels, my body was  doing the opposite which can &lt;a href="https://www.zrtlab.com/media/1488/pho-common-cortisol.pdf?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49456942__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;lead to symptoms like&lt;/a&gt; disrupted sleep, feeling "tired but wired," poor recovery from workouts, and irritability if you don't do anything to reset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="5"&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://eli.health/?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49456942__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;the Eli Health hormometer&lt;/a&gt;, an at-home cortisol test that can give you your cortisol results in almost real time (within 20 minutes.) I decided to try Eli tests throughout the day to learn more about where my levels fall in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="6" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="7" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Experts Featured in This Article:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinapavlovicrivas/?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49456942__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;Marina Pavlovic Rivas&lt;/a&gt;, is the CEO and Co-Founder of Eli Health.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="10" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="11" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My Experience Using the Eli Health Hormometer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="12"&gt;The Eli Health hormometer is a system that consists of a single-use test that looks kinda similar to a pregnancy test that is used to collect saliva, paired with the AI-powered app that reads the test, gives results, and provides insights into your test score and pattern over time. Eli's app makes it super easy to figure out how to use the test, walking you through the entire process with step-by-step instructions and videos to detail the process. To do a test, you simply place one end of the hormometer with the absorbent tip in your mouth and let your saliva soak the pad, holding it in your mouth for about 60 seconds. You then pull the other end of the test, which reveals a dot that tells you when the test is ready. To read the test, you take a photo of the result via the app. A 20-minute timer appears on screen, and you can close the app while you wait for your test result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="13"&gt;Your results are displayed with an overall score that gives you an idea of where your cortisol stacks up compared to the normal range. The score is from 0-100, with 100 being the goal because it means your cortisol is balanced and where it should be for that point in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="14"&gt;I decided to track my cortisol throughout the day to get a better understanding of my curve. I tested one morning right when I woke up, and in the afternoon, around 4:30 after a busy work day. I also tested during a stressful Conrad POV episode on &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/well-always-have-summer-summary-49226020"&gt;"The Summer I Turned Pretty."&lt;/a&gt; After all those tests, I found that my cortisol PM levels are too high and my AM levels are a bit low.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 iRfTZJ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="5"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;I sent my results to Rivas via email, who weighed in a bit more on what my tests meant. (Although the tests don't include personal evaluation from someone, you do get insights and tips in the app.) She said my morning cortisol looked okay, but noted the trend in high evening cortisol. "Your evening levels are elevated, which puts you in what's known as an 'evening high' curve — a sign that your body may be staying in a heightened state of alert when it should be winding down," she tells me over email. She also noted that my cortisol curve looks flat, meaning the difference between my morning and evening levels was smaller than it should be. "An optimal curve typically shows a strong drop from high morning levels to low evening levels," Rivas says. "When that drop is blunted, it can signal chronic stress, tension, or inflammation." I can clearly see that I still have some work to do in the evening relaxation department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;I loved seeing the real time impacts of my lifestyle habits, and that inspired me to make some changes to hopefully get my evening cortisol levels more balanced. Two things that Rivas noted that could impact my evening cortisol is &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/nutrition/is-caffeine-bad-for-you-49420436"&gt;afternoon caffeine&lt;/a&gt; (check) and PM workouts (check). I usually cut off caffeine by 4pm, and don't work out after 6pm typically, but I can see that those two habits may need some tweaking. I plan to shift my workouts to earlier in the day when I can (unless it's a calming yoga class) and switch to matcha in the afternoon since it is lower in caffeine than my usual coffee. I'm also going to try cut off caffeine much earlier in the day. TBH, I could also also probably use more intentional time to get into a relaxed state in the evening — so I might try to make time to wind down. As I make these changes, I look forward to retesting my levels to see more immediately how my lifestyle changes are helping versus waiting for a doctor to order a test and weigh in weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;If you're looking to track your own cortisol levels at home, &lt;a href="http://eli.health/products/cortisol?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49456942__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;Eli Health Cortisol Tests&lt;/a&gt; ($32/month for 4 tests) are currently available for purchase in beta and will officially launch in late September. Something to note: the brand offers the tests as part of a subscription currently. If you purchase a month of tests without a longer subscription commitment, the cost is $100 for the four tests. If you commit to a 12 month subscription, you get the $32 a month price for 4 tests. The brand recommends checking cortisol levels every two weeks, checking as soon as you wake up and in the evening between 5-10 PM. You can also test at specific times if you want to understand how your cortisol levels respond to a workout or other specific event.  Eli Health will also be adding progesterone tests in September, followed by testosterone at a later date in 2026. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="4" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popsugar.com/author/mercey-livingston"&gt;Mercey Livingston&lt;/a&gt; is a writer and editor with eight-plus years of experience covering fitness, health, and nutrition for media outlets and brands including Well+Good, Shape, and Women's Health.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have uncovered direct genomic evidence of the bacterium behind the Plague of Justinian—the world's first recorded pandemic—in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the outbreak was first described nearly 1,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The discovery, led by an interdisciplinary team at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, with collaborators in India and Australia, identified Yersinia pestis, the microbe that causes plague, in a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mass+grave/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt; at the ancient city of Jerash, Jordan, near the pandemic's epicenter. The find definitively links the pathogen to the Justinian Plague marking the first pandemic (AD 541–750), resolving one of history's long-standing mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, historians have deliberated on what caused the devastating outbreak that killed tens of millions, reshaped the Byzantine Empire and altered the course of Western civilization. Despite circumstantial evidence, direct proof of the responsible microbe had remained elusive—a missing link in the story of pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two newly published papers led by USF and FAU provide these long-sought answers, offering new insight into one of the most consequential episodes in human history. The discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/16/8/926" target="_blank"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Genes&lt;/i&gt;, also underscores plague's ongoing relevance today: while rare, Y. pestis continues to circulate worldwide. In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pneumonic+plague/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pneumonic plague&lt;/a&gt;, the most lethal form of Y. pestis infection, marking the first such fatality in the U.S. since 2007, and just last week another individual in California tested positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This discovery provides the long-sought definitive proof of Y. pestis at the epicenter of the Plague of Justinian," said Rays H. Y. Jiang, Ph.D., lead PI of the studies and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health. "For centuries, we've relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague's presence. Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague of Justinian first appeared in the historical record in Pelusium (present day Tell el-Farama) in Egypt before spreading throughout the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire. While traces of Y. pestis had previously been recovered thousands of miles away in small western European villages, no evidence had ever been found within the empire itself or near the heart of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using targeted ancient DNA techniques, we successfully recovered and sequenced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+material/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic material&lt;/a&gt; from eight human teeth excavated from burial chambers beneath the former Roman hippodrome in Jerash, a city just 200 miles from ancient Pelusium" said Greg O'Corry-Crowe, Ph.D., co-author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and a National Geographic Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arena had been repurposed as a mass grave during the mid-sixth to early seventh century, when written accounts describe a sudden wave of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis revealed that the plague victims carried nearly identical strains of Y. pestis, confirming for the first time that the bacterium was present within the Byzantine Empire between AD 550-660. That genetic uniformity suggests a rapid, devastating outbreak consistent with historical descriptions of a plague causing mass death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Jerash site offers a rare glimpse of how ancient societies responded to public health disaster," said Jiang. "Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centers were very likely overwhelmed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A companion study &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/8/797" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Pathogens&lt;/i&gt;, also led by USF and FAU, places the Jerash discovery into a wider evolutionary context. By analyzing hundreds of ancient and modern Y. pestis genomes—including those newly recovered from Jerash—the researchers showed that the bacteria had been circulating among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that later plague pandemics, from the Black Death of the 14th century to cases still appearing today, did not descend from a single ancestral strain. Instead, they arose independently and repeatedly from longstanding animal reservoirs, erupting in multiple waves across different regions and eras. This repeated pattern stands in stark contrast to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19), which originated from a single spillover event and evolved primarily through human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings reshape the understanding of how pandemics emerge, recur and spread, and why they remain a persistent feature of human civilization. The research underscores that pandemics are not singular historical catastrophes, but repeating biological events driven by human congregation, mobility and environmental change—themes that remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research was both scientifically compelling and personally resonant. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the study of human history through the lens of ancient DNA at a time when we ourselves were living through a global pandemic," said O'Corry-Crowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Equally profound was the experience of working with ancient human remains—individuals who lived, suffered, and died centuries ago—and using modern science to help recover and share their stories. It's a humbling reminder of our shared humanity across time and a moving testament to the power of science to give voice to those long silent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very different from COVID-19, both diseases highlight the enduring link between connectivity and pandemic risk, as well as the reality that some pathogens can never be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years and people still die from it today," said Jiang. "Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can't get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the Jerash breakthrough, the team is now expanding its research to Venice, Italy and the Lazaretto Vecchio, a dedicated quarantine island and one the world's most significant plague burial sites. More than 1,200 samples from this Black Death-era mass grave are now housed at USF, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study how early public health measures intersected with pathogen evolution, urban vulnerability and cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;

The trial was randomized, meaning participants were randomly placed in a treatment group or a comparison group that didn't receive the intensive gum treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="d14671e6-4007-4f8c-898b-d320157f52fa"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An ultrasound screen showing the 2D image of the common carotid segment. The central black area is the channel within the carotid blood vessel, and the more defined layers on each side of this central channel are the artery walls. The periphery of the image shows the soft tissues surrounding the artery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Marco Orlandi)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="27e2bbc4-c252-4603-b2ba-7374aa03fbf9"&gt;First, the researchers took ultrasounds of the carotid arteries of 135 people with severe periodontitis, to establish a baseline level of thickness. They also measured how much the arteries dilated when blood flow increased — a measure of blood vessel functioning — and took blood samples to pinpoint markers of inflammatory and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All of the individuals were healthy besides having gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants were randomly divided into either the treatment group or the control group. Care was taken to ensure there was a roughly even split between the two groups in terms of the participants' periodontitis severity, smoking status and family history of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the treatment group, patients received intensive periodontitis treatment: a thorough clean of the whole mouth and a deep clean below the gumline to remove plaque and tartar. The control group received a simple scale and polish, more akin to a regular dental cleaning that doesn't include a deep clean of the gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were then followed for two years, and they each received further dental treatments at regular intervals throughout that time. The researchers also reassessed the carotid artery at the one-year and two-year marks, and took blood samples and measured blood-vessel function at five time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the thickness of the carotid arteries' innermost linings was lower for individuals who received intensive treatment than for those in the control group. This difference was "comparable to what has been seen with lifestyle interventions and some pharmacological agents in similar populations," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5705-francesco-d'aiuto" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5705-francesco-d'aiuto" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Francesco D'Aiuto&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical research periodontist at University College London, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated patients also had better blood vessel function and lower levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in their blood, which are known to contribute to the narrowing of artery walls — a condition called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;&lt;u&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many factors drive atherosclerosis, "our results reinforce the view that untreated periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor for vascular ageing and possibly cardiovascular events," D'Aiuto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a key limitation of the research is that it was conducted in only one location, so there is a chance that the findings partly come down to quirks of the location or the people in the sample, Orlandi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bc667cdc-20da-462d-8431-08aad054d037"&gt;Another limitation, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.efp.org/for-patients/gum-disease-general-health/perio-caries/overview/our-experts/maurizio-tonetti/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.efp.org/for-patients/gum-disease-general-health/perio-caries/overview/our-experts/maurizio-tonetti/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Maurizio Tonetti&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical and research periodontist at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the research, is that all of the participants in the trial were healthy other than having periodontitis. As such, these results should not be interpreted as evidence that if someone with atherosclerosis has their gum disease treated, the health of their arteries will improve, he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the findings "are bringing the concept of these [intensive gum disease] interventions into the preservation of wellness," Tonetti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many, many years, dentists have been focusing on the teeth, forgetting the rest of the body, and physicians have been focusing on the body, forgetting that there are teeth," he said. "They are really two worlds that have been separated and need to go back together for the benefit of patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pQitSfqkt6kwnnZLMgtyDN-hhhCWlAmIdMnJ6RHycPhxNCAsQWe4AAl" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pQitSfqkt6kwnnZLMgtyDN-hhhCWlAmIdMnJ6RHycPhxNCAsQWe4AAl slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to boost brain power, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-may-not-work-but-there-is-a-way-to-boost-your-cognition"&gt;learning new skills.&lt;/a&gt; But what about boosting the actual size of your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, wearing the right kind of perfume or cologne can enlarge your brain's gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Kyoto University and the University of Tsukuba in Japan asked 28 women to wear a specific rose scent oil on their clothing for a month, with another 22 volunteers enlisted &lt;a href="https://bioivt.com/blogs/control-matrices"&gt;as controls&lt;/a&gt; who put on plain water instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) scans showed boosts in the gray matter volume of the rose scent participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an increase in brain volume doesn't necessarily translate into more thinking power, the findings could have implications for neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-link-between-menthol-and-alzheimers-found-in-mice"&gt;Surprise Link Between Menthol And Alzheimer's Found in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study is the first to show that continuous scent inhalation changes brain structure," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen scents like this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2023.1200448"&gt;improve memory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-function-dramatically-boosted-by-certain-fragrances-during-sleep"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, but here the team wanted to try a longer-term experiment to see how triggering our sense of smell might lead to measurable changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg" alt="Brain diagram" class="wp-image-172164 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers compared changes in the amount of gray matter tissue in specific areas of the brain. (Kokubun et al, &lt;em&gt;Brain Res. Bull.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While overall gray matter increased, the difference varied by region. There was little change in the amygdala (where emotions are managed) or in the orbitofrontal cortex (where nice smells are processed). But there was significantly more gray matter in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;posterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; or PCC (linked to memory and association).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83621-2"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that in people who have problems with their olfactory system, the amygdala (directly linked to smell) is less active, while the posterior cingulate cortex (indirectly linked to smell) is more active. The brain overcompensates, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest something similar might be happening here. The amygdala doesn't have to keep alerting the brain to the rose scent, because it's always there – but the posterior cingulate cortex has to continually process it and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;store related memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC is involved in memory-odor associations, odor memory retrieval, and semantic memory processes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC, which processes odor memories, was more activated than the amygdala, which is responsible for sensing odors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's difficult to pin down exactly what's causing this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bilingual-brains-have-higher-volume-of-grey-matter-study-suggests"&gt;boost in gray matter&lt;/a&gt;. Another possibility raised by the researchers is that the rose scent is actually labeled as unpleasant by the brain, with the subsequent emotional regulation responsible for the PCC working harder and increasing in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that the findings could be useful in the development of aromatherapies that boost mental health and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-layers-of-your-brain-actually-get-stronger-as-you-age"&gt;brain plasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Adding a scent to clothing would be just like wearing perfume or aftershave – a cheap, easy to potentially benefit the health of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, with further testing on different types of scents and bigger groups of people, the discoveries here could even be used to reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCC is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.01.018"&gt;known to shrink&lt;/a&gt; in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, and keeping it stimulated with fragrances could be a way of keeping this part of the brain active and functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, the result of the current study suggests that continuous inhalation of rose essential oil may prevent brain atrophy and prevent dementia," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Research Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Using self-reports and brain imaging, scientists found that HVB both activated the body’s stress response and increased blood flow to emotion-processing regions like the amygdala and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes correlated with bliss, emotional release, and unity, known as “oceanic boundlessness.” Participants consistently reported reduced fear and negative emotions, highlighting breathwork’s potential as a non-pharmacological therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic-Like States:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathwork evoked sensations of bliss, unity, and emotional breakthrough comparable to psychedelics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Blood Flow Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; HVB decreased blood flow globally but boosted activity in the amygdala and hippocampus, tied to emotion and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants reported reduced fear and negative emotions across all sessions with no adverse effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathwork while listening to music may induce a blissful state in practitioners, accompanied by changes in blood flow to emotion-processing brain regions, according to a study published August 27, 2025, in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Amla Kartar from the Colasanti Lab in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, U.K., and colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes occur even while the body’s stress response may be activated and are associated with reporting reduced negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, accompanied by music, can lead to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) similar to those evoked by psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High ventilation breathwork (HVB) might offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill this knowledge gap, Kartar and colleagues characterized ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners by analyzing self-reported data from 15 individuals who participated online, 8 individuals who participated in the lab, and 19 individuals who underwent magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their task consisted of a 20- to 30-minute session of cyclic breathing without pausing while listening to music, followed by a series of questionnaires within 30 minutes of finishing the breathwork session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation, as indicated by a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating a potential stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, HVB-evoked ASCs were associated with a profound decrease in blood flow to the left operculum and posterior insula – brain regions implicated in representing the internal state of the body, including breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, despite HVB causing large and global reductions in blood flow to the brain, there was a progressive increase in blood flow during the session to the right amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are brain regions involved in the processing of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These blood flow changes correlated with psychedelic experiences, demonstrating that these alterations may underlie the positive effects of this breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a reduction in fear and negative emotions, with no adverse reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which is a term coined by Freud in 1920 that describes a set of related feelings including spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, their study was novel and exploratory and requires replication by future research including larger sample sizes and a control group to separate the effects of music on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings provide a better understanding of HVB and direct research to investigate its therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Our research is the first to use neuroimaging to map the neurophysiological changes that occur during breathwork. Our key findings include that breathwork can reliably evoke profound psychedelic states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that these states are linked to changes in the function of specific brain regions involved in self-awareness, and fear and emotional memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that more profound changes in blood flow in specific brain areas were linked to deeper sensations of unity, bliss, and emotional release, collectively known as “oceanic boundlessness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Kartar, lead author, adds: “Conducting this research was a fantastic experience. It was thrilling to explore such a novel area – while many people anecdotally recognize the health benefits of breathwork, this style of fast-paced breathing has received very little scientific attention. We are very grateful to our participants for making this work possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alessandro Colasanti, P.I., adds: “Breathwork is a powerful yet natural tool for neuromodulation, working through the regulation of metabolism across the body and brain. It holds tremendous promise as a transformative therapeutic intervention for conditions that are often both distressing and disabling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and consciousness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#47282922373522343407372b283469283520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurobiological substrates of altered states of consciousness induced by high ventilation breathwork accompanied by music&lt;/a&gt;” by Amy Kartar et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobiological substrates of altered states of consciousness induced by high ventilation breathwork accompanied by music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus;

That choice made any between twin differences more likely to reflect the supplement rather than family background or shared habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-changed-in-the-gut"&gt;What changed in the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are food components that our enzymes do not digest, so bacteria ferment them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, relative levels of specific microbes shifted, including an increase in Bifidobacterium, a genus that often responds to inulin and fructooligosaccharides in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9413759/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;controlled trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants tolerated the supplement well, with only mild, expected gastrointestinal complaints reported. Adherence stayed high throughout the 3 month window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in the gut community did not upend overall diversity. Instead, a few taxa moved in meaningful ways that are biologically plausible for fiber fermenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prebiotic group scored higher on a combined cognition factor and made fewer errors on the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-neuropsychological-society/article/paired-associate-performance-in-the-early-detection-of-dat/1AFD16E84A939D43AD0A5BF100CDF8AD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAL test,&lt;/a&gt; a visual paired associated task sensitive to early Alzheimer’s related change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits with decades of work showing PAL detects subtle episodic memory problems before many standard clinic scales do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brain-map-shows-how-rhythms-instantly-reconfigure-your-mind-freq-ness/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; health and memory in our ageing population,” said Dr. Lochlainn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific test improvement matters because paired associates learning taps the ability to form new connections between locations and patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a core function that erodes early in Alzheimer’s, so even small gains on this task are notable in people over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-not-change"&gt;What did not change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement did not improve chair rise time or other muscle strength measures over 12 weeks. That result held even though everyone received protein and was encouraged to perform simple resistance exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short interventions often struggle to move physical outcomes in older adults. The authors acknowledge the window may have been too brief to remodel muscle while still being long enough to nudge &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreational-cannabis-use-protects-against-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These plant fibres, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too,” said Professor Claire Steves, senior author at King’s College London. She added that larger and longer trials are the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-brain-link-fits-the-data"&gt;Gut-brain link fits the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes create short chain fatty acids, neurotransmitter precursors, and other metabolites that signal along nerves and through the immune system. Reviews outline how this axis shapes learning and memory, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging itself alters microbial communities and the barriers that keep inflammation in check. Those shifts ripple into brain circuits involved in attention, processing speed, and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber fermenters like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4908950/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; thrive on inulin and fructooligosaccharides, producing metabolites tied to synaptic plasticity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That biochemical context helps explain why cognition moved while muscle metrics did not in a 3 month trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-read-these-results"&gt;How to read these results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This RCT used a strong within family control, a clear intervention, and validated cognitive outcomes. It also kept participants engaged through a fully remote setup that reduces travel barriers for older volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cohort was modest and mostly female, and the findings apply to healthy older adults rather than people with diagnosed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics say cognition moved, but the study was not designed to tell us whether daily functioning changed in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet, medications, and baseline microbiomes differ from person to person. That reality suggests responses to the same fiber dose may vary, a point future work should tackle with larger samples and longer follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-could-go-next"&gt;Where this could go next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical next step is to compare different fiber types, doses, and durations head to head in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also need to test whether early cognitive gains persist at 6 or 12 months and whether they translate into fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; slips in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic work can help map which metabolites rise with supplementation and which brain networks respond. Remote designs, as shown here, make those studies more feasible and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe profile and accessibility of these fibers lower the barrier to rigorous testing in community settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unanswered question is not whether the gut talks to the brain, it is how best to tune that conversation for lasting cognitive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQU1M2b05Cd3RMay1OOEFXeGtYdjJobFRqZ0ZnR3JmQ25hcTVZemVHWjliRF90UlJabjVMa2dtdEVZWHRCS3VnMXVRZ2RxVzFhRHJIcHc3SGRTUlVPT01VQ2UzaWNjeTBQU0Q5bDBoUGNkSThFLXMxbllWN3o5d2YzZk05dGlfMkd2YmNWbm1KSDhzU3JBdzgyaTg5RkhSZURDOFpodlFwQVRKeWpsX25tWV9tTlFzRXZ1MzNLMjZwVGw0dU9uVGF3</guid></item><item><title>新方法无需药物或手术即可缓解关节炎性膝盖- futurity.org</title><link>https://www.futurity.org/relieve-arthritic-knees-without-drugs-surgery-3292232/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="stickem-container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;A new study reveals a potential way to relieve arthritic knees without drugs or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a quarter of people over the age of 40 experience painful osteoarthritis, making it a leading cause of disability in adults. Osteoarthritis &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/osteoarthritis-joints-epilepsy-drug-3067942/"&gt;degrades&lt;/a&gt; joint-cushioning cartilage, and there is currently no way of reversing this damage: the only option is to manage pain with medication, and eventually, joint replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now demonstrating the potential for another option: gait retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making a &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/walking-knees-muscles-digital-human-2769262/"&gt;small adjustment&lt;/a&gt; to the angle of their foot while walking, participants in a year-long randomized control trial experienced pain relief equivalent to medication. Critically, those participants also showed less knee cartilage degradation over that period as compared to a group that received a placebo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(25)00151-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and co-led by Scott Uhlrich of the University of Utah’s John and Marcia Price College of Engineering, these findings come from the first placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a biomechanical intervention for osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that for people with osteoarthritis, higher loads in their knee accelerate progression, and that changing the foot angle can reduce knee load,” says Uhlrich, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the idea of a biomechanical intervention is not new, but there have not been randomized, placebo-controlled studies to show that they’re effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support from the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, the researchers were specifically looking at patients with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee—on the inside of the leg—which tends to bear more weight than the lateral, outside, compartment. This form of osteoarthritis is the most common, but the ideal foot angle for reducing load in the medial side of the knee differs from person to person, depending on their natural gait and how it changes when they adopt the new walking pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous trials prescribed the same intervention to all individuals, resulting in some individuals not reducing, or even increasing, their joint loading,” Uhlrich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We used a personalized approach to selecting each individual’s new walking pattern, which improved how much individuals could offload their knee and likely contributed to the positive effect on pain and cartilage that we saw.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their first two visits, participants received a baseline MRI and practiced walking on a pressure-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras recorded the mechanics of their gait. This allowed the researchers to determine whether turning the patient’s toe inward or outward would reduce load more, and whether a 5-degree or 10-degree adjustment would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This personalized analysis also screened out potential participants who could not benefit from the intervention in instances where none of the foot-angle changes could decrease loading in their knees. These participants were included in previous studies, which may have contributed to those studies’ inconclusive pain results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after their initial intake sessions, half of the 68 participants were assigned to a sham treatment group to control for the placebo effect. These participants were prescribed foot angles that were actually identical to their natural gait. Conversely, participants in the intervention group were prescribed the change in foot angle that maximally reduced their knee loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants from both groups returned to the lab for six weekly training sessions, where they received biofeedback—vibrations from a device worn on the shin—that helped them maintain the prescribed foot angle while walking on the lab’s treadmill. After the six-week training period, participants were encouraged to practice their new gait for at least 20 minutes a day, to the point where it became natural. Periodic check-in visits showed that participants were adhering to their prescribed foot angle within a degree on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, all participants self-reported their experience of knee pain and had a second MRI to quantitatively assess the damage to their knee cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reported decrease in pain over the placebo group was somewhere between what you’d expect from an over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen, and a narcotic, like oxycontin,” Uhlrich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the MRIs, we also saw slower degradation of a marker of cartilage health in the intervention group, which was quite exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the quantitative measures of effectiveness, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm for both the approach and the results. One participant said, “I don’t have to take a drug or wear a device… it’s just a part of my body now that will be with me for the rest of my days, so that I’m thrilled with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ ability to adhere to the intervention over long periods of time is one of its potential advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Especially for people in their 30s, 40s, or 50s, osteoarthritis could mean decades of pain management before they’re recommended for a joint replacement,” Uhrlich says. “This intervention could help fill that large treatment gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this intervention can be clinically deployed, the gait retraining process will need to be streamlined. The motion-capture technique used to make the original foot-angle prescription is expensive and time-consuming; the researchers envision this intervention to eventually be prescribed in a physical therapy clinic and retraining can happen while people go for a walk around their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We and others have developed technology that could be used to both personalize and deliver this intervention in a clinical setting using mobile sensors, like smartphone video and a ‘smart shoe,'” Uhlrich says. Future studies of this approach are needed before the intervention can be made widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional researchers from the University of Utah, New York University, and Stanford University contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for the research came from federal research grants from the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Institutes of Health, and National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco found that increasing levels of a protein called ferritin light chain 1 (Ftl-1) in neurons impairs memory and synaptic function in young mice, while reducing its levels in aged mice rejuvenates brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is a common feature of aging, even in the absence of disease. Past work has shown that this decline is not primarily caused by neuron death, but rather by changes in how neurons function, especially at their synapses—points of communication between cells that are essential for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team sought to identify specific molecules that contribute to this decline and could potentially be targeted to reverse it. The hippocampus, a brain region known for its role in memory, is especially vulnerable to aging. The researchers reasoned that if they could uncover the molecular drivers of age-related hippocampal dysfunction, it might open the door to therapeutic interventions for cognitive aging—and perhaps even for age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since I was a kid, I’ve always felt passionate about the brain, and in the last few years I’ve become really excited about aging. Joining Dr. Saul Villeda’s lab at UCSF as a postdoc gave me the chance to connect my two passions—brain and aging—and work on the mechanisms responsible for brain aging,” said Laura Remesal, the lead author of the new study and the founding scientist of Babylon Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began by examining changes in gene expression in neurons taken from the hippocampi of young and aged mice. Using RNA sequencing, the team identified dozens of genes that were expressed at higher or lower levels with age. When they compared these transcriptional changes with age-related shifts in protein expression, measured by mass spectrometry, one molecule stood out: Ftl-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ftl-1 is a component of ferritin, a protein complex that stores iron in cells. The researchers found that Ftl-1 was elevated in the hippocampal neurons of aged mice and that its expression levels were strongly linked to poorer performance on memory tasks. This correlation suggested that Ftl-1 might be more than just a marker of aging—it could be a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team used a virus-based method to increase Ftl-1 expression specifically in the hippocampal neurons of young mice. The consequences were significant. These mice exhibited structural changes in their neurons, including shorter dendrites and fewer synapses—features typically associated with aging. They also performed worse on memory tests, showing little interest in exploring new objects or novel maze arms, in contrast to healthy young controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers reversed course. They used several approaches—short hairpin RNA, CRISPR gene editing, and conditional knockout models—to reduce Ftl-1 levels in the hippocampi of aged mice. Remarkably, this intervention led to improved memory performance. Aged mice with reduced Ftl-1 performed better on tests of recognition and spatial memory, and their hippocampal neurons showed more youthful characteristics, including restored synaptic markers and improved signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The degree of improvement in memory and synaptic measures were striking,” Remesal told PsyPost. “It suggested that changing a single aging-related factor can produce meaningful functional gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how Ftl-1 affects neuron function, the team looked more closely at cellular processes. They found that Ftl-1 overexpression disrupted the balance between different oxidation states of iron within neurons, increasing the level of oxidized iron. This shift can interfere with mitochondrial function, particularly the cell’s ability to produce ATP, which is critical for energy-intensive processes like maintaining synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, neurons overexpressing Ftl-1 showed diminished ATP production. In contrast, knocking down Ftl-1 enhanced cellular energy output. These results pointed to a link between iron metabolism, mitochondrial health, and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psypost-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stay informed with the latest psychology and neuroscience research—sign up for PsyPost’s newsletter and get new discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wondered if they could counteract the effects of Ftl-1 by supporting mitochondrial function directly. To test this, they gave mice a supplement called NADH, which plays a key role in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. In mice that had been genetically altered to overexpress Ftl-1, NADH supplementation improved both neuronal structure and memory performance. These animals, which had previously failed to show a preference for novel objects or maze arms, regained that ability after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, NADH appeared to rescue the neurons’ energy metabolism. RNA sequencing of neurons from treated mice revealed increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, such as Sdhb, Atp5o, and Ndufa10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings indicate that Ftl-1 contributes to brain aging by disrupting iron homeostasis and energy metabolism, and that both removing this protein and supporting mitochondrial function can restore cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important takeaway is that cognitive impairment can be reversed, not just prevented or delayed,” Remesal explained. “Treating the aged brain might have more potential than we first thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the study was conducted entirely in mice. The extent to which these findings will translate to humans remains unknown. Ftl-1, or FTL in humans, performs a conserved role in iron storage, and mutations in the gene have been linked to a rare neurodegenerative disorder known as neuroferritinopathy. Directly targeting FTL in people would require careful evaluation of safety, as altering iron storage could have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work was done in mice, so I’m wary of drawing hard translational lines to humans,” Remesal said. “Still, the biology is indeed shared between mouse and human and the protein plays the same core role. This gives us confidence that this protein therefore might be a therapeutic target worth pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are optimistic that their findings provide a foundation for future work. They note that iron dysregulation has already been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. In fact, elevated ferritin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been shown to predict cognitive decline over time in people with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also supports a growing body of research suggesting that the aging brain remains plastic—that is, capable of recovering function. Targeting individual molecular pathways, even late in life, might not only slow cognitive decline but partially reverse it. This perspective marks a shift away from the idea that age-related memory loss is inevitable and irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for the team include investigating whether Ftl-1-targeted therapies can benefit mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. They are also interested in examining how Ftl-1 is regulated during aging and whether its effects differ across brain regions. Ultimately, they hope to explore whether similar interventions could be developed for human use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Laura Remesal, Juliana Sucharov-Costa, Yuting Wu, Karishma J.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae13t000b3b7af7tor5h6@published"&gt;My in-laws live a four-hour flight away but visit us five to six times a year. They’re both retired and enjoy traveling. My husband and I are parents to their only grandchildren, and they &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; they love spending time with them. But their behavior shows otherwise, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuag8p100103b7afqim0la2@published"&gt;Their visits typically revolve around concerts, so they have a number of nights out while they stay with us. This is usually fine, but when they decide to see their favorite bands’ multiple east coast tour stops, we feel like our apartment is a convenient, free Airbnb for them. It seems like seeing their grandchildren is not their actual priority. They also don’t really play with the kids; they just like to observe them. My son is about to turn 5 and he’s now questioning why Grandma and Grandpa “only like to look at him.” We had a second child last summer and they similarly like to watch her play. They offer to babysit, but I think it’s mostly so they can say they offered—when we’ve tried to take them up on it, they say they can’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought they were coming for my son’s birthday, but we just found out they plan to leave early in the morning on his birthday, before any of us are awake. My son knows they’re coming but doesn’t know their departure plans yet, and l know he’ll be upset that they won’t actually be here to celebrate with him. We’re both struggling with how to tell our son his grandparents are sneaking away at dawn on his birthday in a way that doesn’t vilify them. We’re pretty annoyed with their travel plans and have voiced our displeasure to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to emphasize that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the power to put a stop to their frequent stays—your house is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an Airbnb, however they treat it, and you do not actually have to let them stay with you every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="231" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae22p000g3b7aoxc9hka4@published"&gt;For all the complaining some people do when their hopes of having grandchildren are dashed, there seem to be plenty of people who just don’t seem terribly interested in the role of grandparent. But there are also people who just aren’t very good at it, sometimes because it’s been a long time since they spent much time with young children. I’m not trying to defend your in-laws, because they do seem to be freely using your house as their free vacation lodging, but if their grandparent failings are compounded by their awkwardness with your son, you (or better yet, your husband) can try to facilitate more interaction next time they come to see you. When my kids were small and spent 90 percent of their day reading, playing games, building towers, serving pretend meals, etc. on the living room floor, our relatives learned they probably needed to be on the kids’ level if they wanted to interact with them. You can be ready to point out your kids’ favorite games and books and crafts etc. to ease everyone into playtime. Yes, this is kind of annoying, but if you do it and it still doesn’t work, at least you’ll know you tried everything you could. Ultimately, it’s up to your in-laws to build a relationship with their grandson; you are not and can’t be responsible for it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae243000h3b7avo2k1hpp@published"&gt;As for what to tell your son about this upcoming visit, I don’t see any benefit to sharing your irritation with him or using language like “sneaking away at dawn.” All you need to say is that Grandma and Grandpa have to go home on his birthday. See if your in-laws can celebrate with him in some way a day or two before, maybe with some pre-birthday cake or ice cream. I hope they at least know enough to bring a gift for him to open.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try not to listen above 60 percent of volume,' he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, finally, the last two habits he recommended that young people stop were drinking alcohol and participating in recreational drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cocaine or fentanyl is like playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun, with your life,' he warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not only cocaine that has the potential to cause damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Levine states that smoking marijuana can 'reduce cognitive ability,' and can be bad for your lungs and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At number five, alcohol,' he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's responsible for lots of accidents.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7eme500123b7ai5ao92cq@published"&gt;I’m a 44-year-old man and I’ve been married to a 45-year-old woman for the past 15 years. About six years ago, she told me that she was basically done with sex. While we have had sex maybe 10 times or so since then, her statement has been essentially true. She was never particularly sexual anyway (she never communicated about likes/dislikes, fantasies, masturbation, etc.) and didn’t feel like physical intimacy was important to her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="203" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emfm00133b7ayrgpz0yk@published"&gt;While I do not feel the same way, I have been, and continue to be, willing to continue our marriage this way. But here is my question: Through recent avid reading of this column, I have learned quite a bit regarding the spectrum of sexuality and have come to strongly believe that my wife is some version of asexual. In retrospect, I think she probably always has been. I don’t think that she spends much time thinking about her own sexuality beyond it being something she can live without. I have started wondering, though, if pushing her to think about it in a bit more self-reflective way and potentially coming to a conclusion/labeling it would be helpful for my own mental health and confidence in the relationship. Even if it is what I already suspect, I can’t help but think that “knowing” it to be true (and to some extent her “admitting” it’s true) would help our relationship.  I am fully aware that this would be entirely for me, as, again, I am nearly positive she does not think about this in any type of self-reflective way. So what do you think? Discuss this with her to ease my own mind, or just maintain the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emjx00163b7ak6k3giq2@published"&gt;Given the mores of millennials and Gen Z, it may be unfashionable to hold this opinion, but I believe labels can help everyone. They are shortcuts to understanding human complexity. Granted, they should be used with the tacit understanding that they can be imprecise and certainly do not describe everything (even about the qualities they are highlighting), and thus are often limiting. But in terms of conveying a rough understanding of something like a person’s sexuality, they can be quite useful for orienting not only the labelee but the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emlg00173b7a8250kko5@published"&gt;Let’s take your situation as an example: Your wife describing herself as asexual would help you understand the reasons behind the dearth of sex in your relationship. It could help you refrain from taking said lack of sex personally, help you not see it as an evaluation of your performance or attractiveness. In other words, it would confirm it’s not you, it’s her. However, since you already suspect that your wife is on the ace spectrum, as it would explain so much, you should ask yourself why confirmation is important to you. Is there, for example, lingering doubt about other potential reasons why your wife is done with sex? Are you just big on formal decrees of one’s personhood? Knowing this about yourself will be useful, as any persistence on your part in attempting to coax out a declaration of your wife’s perceived asexuality will likely prompt the question, “Why do you want to know?”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emmy00183b7au5j2oct1@published"&gt;I don’t think there is anything wrong with having a conversation that begins somewhere around, “Do you think you might be asexual?” Even if it is for you, communication, particularly on something as important as your partner’s sexuality, is a good thing. But you should be prepared to receive her where she is. You can’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; her dissect parts of herself that she cannot reach or is otherwise not interested in reaching. That is to say: Don’t push her. Have the conversation and see where it goes. If she denies it and you aren’t convinced, you can tell her that and why. Perhaps follow up by purchasing one of the excellent books on asexuality that have been published in the last few years, like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ATH53V9MSN2K&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9Ci0fubTz7JypNJkOd07epL0sms16ithw1xQUbZGopKlT3BP7_9S80EiVsbhXyvg-EdTkOgo8lsIoYXN0HxbwRs.4aGk6tzkjd_glgqrbPwJ86MZ_ym1HHMVlAQg9Q6-bH0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ace+angela+chen&amp;amp;qid=1756130574&amp;amp;sprefix=ace+angela,aps,183&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or Cody Daigle-Orians’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Ace-Advice-Living-Asexual/dp/1839972629/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1IM4OFX5HJOHB&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dFHyODVV9BOQqahOJZybQOPJFzdw4W94nMCP5Cv-cdW2ogwqsoWhbmUjr8KSzO4PcODiHjX4EIK06uNlzb453dusb7X-bbIdpQunV2Hdwno.Zdk_QtS6469LzkyC6pjR9m8mpY3NXLOnjYl24qaeNt0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cody+daigle-orians&amp;amp;qid=1756130601&amp;amp;sprefix=cody+da,aps,890&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002v3b7aryminm8z@published"&gt;My boyfriend has difficulty coming. When it does come out, it doesn’t shoot. It just kind of dribbles for about a minute. He’s only 32 and not experiencing any pain, but I’ve never had any guy I’ve ever been with have this sort of issue. I’ve suggested that he see a urologist, but he waves it off, saying it’s been like this for him for the last three years and he’s fine. Should I insist?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002y3b7alk2xa204@published"&gt;There are guys who come a lot and those who don’t, and this is often just a matter of general human variance with no bearing on overall health. But here’s what grabbed me in your letter: Your boyfriend saw a change in his overall output some three years ago. Again, it could be nothing, but it’s always best to make sure that any changes we see in the body aren’t the result of an underlying condition. Weak ejaculation (or perceived ejaculate volume reduction) &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/weak-ejaculation#ejaculation-conditions"&gt;may indicate nerve damage&lt;/a&gt; caused by conditions like diabetes or multiple sclerosis. It could be the product of medicine or other factors like stress. Similarly, delayed ejaculation could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delayed-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20371358"&gt;hormonal conditions or neurological diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes changes like those your boyfriend has observed within himself are benign. Sometimes they amount to our bodies sending us messages. My advice is to always keep your line open for when your body calls with something to say. So yes, I think it would be wise for your boyfriend to see a doctor just in case. It’s much better to rule out something more serious than to be unaware that something grave is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jg002z3b7ayapav0m4@published"&gt;If this is bothering him, he could try incorporating kegel exercises to strengthen his pelvic floor and perhaps tighten up the pressure of his ejaculations (you can find a brief description of these exercises &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/08/gay-men-sex-advice-my-husband-threesome-revenge.html"&gt;in a recent column&lt;/a&gt;). But it seems that this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; bothering him, if his laissez-faire response to you about his dick dribble is any indication. How to make him care? Pointing out that an underlying condition may be at the root of this might inspire action on his part. But ultimately, you can’t make him care about anything. That’s on him. Hopefully, inspiration will kick in well before an actual issue presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;

And TRT delivered his sex drive, as it’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5649360/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589949/"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jh00353b7alam3cqrg@published"&gt;Unless his sex drive becomes so distracting that it impacts his obligations/daily life, I don’t think this is much of a problem. Swing by when you can, but otherwise, leave him to his own devices, of which he now owns several. It seems like he’s doing what he needs to do with his libido boost. If he is unsatisfied with the results, he should talk to his doctor. But something tells me that he’s currently thrilled enough for both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9a5d03b0-cd42-4bb9-ad5d-5034336b91d8"&gt;Scientists have developed a potential new method for corrective eye surgery that doesn't use lasers, but instead shapes the eye's outer surface using an electrical current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method has so far been tested only in animals, but the researchers who pioneered it hope that it will someday offer an alternative or complement to conventional LASIK surgery. The team presented their findings Aug. 18 at the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/35/session/563514" target="_blank" data-url="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/35/session/563514" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Chemical Society's annual meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="9a5d03b0-cd42-4bb9-ad5d-5034336b91d8-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/in-depth/lasik-surgery/art-20045751" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/in-depth/lasik-surgery/art-20045751" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LASIK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular type of "refractive" laser surgery, which adjusts how light passes through the clear outer layer of the eye, or cornea. It can correct the changes in the cornea that cause nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. For those looking to ditch glasses or contact lenses, LASIK has become a common solution: since its approval in 1999 this surgery has treated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982707/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982707/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 10 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6967e060-cde2-4a5a-9e95-6888d1999550"&gt;The cornea bends light to focus it on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, before the visual information is sent to the brain to be processed. Irregularly shaped corneas don't focus light properly, resulting in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/corneal-conditions/corneal-dystrophies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/corneal-conditions/corneal-dystrophies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;impaired vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This technique previously enabled the researchers to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/abs/doi/10.1001/jamafacial.2016.0166" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.liebertpub.com/abs/doi/10.1001/jamafacial.2016.0166" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reshape rabbit ears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and alter &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923181120300256" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923181120300256" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;scars on pigs' skin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, approaches that they plan to develop for eventual use in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-do-screens-damage-your-eyes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-do-screens-damage-your-eyes"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do screens damage your eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMR uses electricity to alter tissues. Many collagen-containing tissues in the body, including the cornea, are held in place by oppositely charged components attracted to each other like magnets. These tissues also contain water, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c01177" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c01177" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;zapping the tissues with electricity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ultimately lowers their pH, making them more acidic. With the pH altered, the attraction between opposite charged components is unlocked, loosening up the tissue and making it moldable. When scientists then cut the electricity and restore the tissue's original pH, it locks back into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill and Wong wondered whether EMR could be used to reshape the cornea. To see, they ran tests with rabbit eyes in lab dishes. They created a platinum contact lens template to imitate the corrected shape of a cornea, placed it over a rabbit eyeball in saline solution, and sent an electric current through the platinum lens. Within about a minute, the rabbit eyeball's cornea molded around the contact lens; the whole process took about the same time as LASIK surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="95524a28-2ceb-41cb-bee9-bcc712e0981c"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;EMR flattened this rabbit cornea, shown in a cross section, from its original shape (white line) to a corrected one (yellow line). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Daniel Kim and Mimi Chen)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="621061ec-e124-4c99-8d93-223eb3ccd8a3"&gt;The researchers tested this method on 12 rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. The treatment successfully reshaped the cornea in a way that would better focus light on the retina, and the cells in the eyeballs were not damaged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method might also be able to reverse cloudiness in the cornea, Hill and Wong told Live Science, which is currently only treatable through a corneal transplant. That's something they're still experimenting with, but in theory, tweaking the pH of the cornea could also help counter the cloudiness, they think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Hill and Wong are hopeful about the promise of EMR eye treatments, this procedure is in very early stages, they said. The next steps are studies in living animals, and more specific tests to assess which specific vision issues this process can correct, like near- and farsightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like any other medical technology it's a process, and you have to go through a fair amount of testing," Wong told Live Science. This includes testing more with animal tissues and with live animals, resolving any issues that arise, and eventually moving on to various phases of clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early preclinical tests of the method are promising in that they show the procedure is safe for eye cells and that the cornea remains clear after EMR alteration, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opt.uh.edu/profiles/maria-walker/index.cfm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.opt.uh.edu/profiles/maria-walker/index.cfm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maria Walker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an optometrist at the University of Houston, told Live Science. But further testing would need to investigate possible longer-term effects. "It might be safe and the cornea might be clear, but then what happens in a month?" said Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some issues with laser eye surgery, although rare, come from heat transfer to the cornea, which EMR techniques would avoid, Walker noted. "My impression is cautiously optimistic," she said. "I think it's promising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ae3c7193-5e62-4841-9f56-cf5ae9904e84"&gt;If the method is proven to be successful and safe in humans, it could someday offer an alternative or complement to LASIK that's possibly reversible — since it's not actually removing any tissue, just rearranging it — and cheaper, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't treat every single problem of the cornea with LASIK, there are areas where it simply doesn't have application," said Wong. There are certain patients who &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/lasik/when-lasik-not-me" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/lasik/when-lasik-not-me" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aren't good candidates for LASIK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "So I think there are areas where this would have value complementing LASIK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of EMR equipment would also be cheaper than laser equipment, said Wong, which could potentially make it accessible to more patients looking to correct their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm-iItIwUSvo7j1JLcG1rY2hBoW9JS3thVp" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm-iItIwUSvo7j1JLcG1rY2hBoW9JS3thVp slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/press-release/2025/08/groundbreaking-inova-study-finds-potential-link-between-long-distance-running-and-colon-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows a potential link between extreme endurance exercise and increased risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults, according to research at Inova Schar Cancer Institute, in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Cannon, a medical oncologist, told WTOP after examining several young endurance runners under the age of 40 who had advanced colon cancer, he hypothesized that prolonged stress on the gut during long-distance running may trigger cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study of 100 adults between the ages of 35 and 50, who had run five or more marathons or two or more ultramarathons, Cannon found 15% of the participants had advanced adenomas, which are precancerous lesions, compared to the expected 1% to 2% in non-runners in this age range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The normal risk in the 35 to 50 population would be one-fifth of those numbers,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the participants was 42.5 year old — two and half years before the recommended age of 45, for a first screening colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we all get colonoscopies, or we should all get colonoscopies, when we turn 45, is because if we remove a polyp or adenoma before it becomes cancerous, then we’re likely going to be safe from cancer,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An often-ignored warning sign for endurance athletes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said long distance runners, and many of their physicians, have downplayed bleeding after a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very common among long distance runners, and it’s often been called ‘runner’s colitis,'” Cannon said. “The slang is ‘runners’ trots.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have assumed that ‘runner’s colitis’ is a benign entity, so they’ve been saying ‘It’s normal for runners to bleed.’ And the reason I know this, is because that’s what these runners who have cancer are telling me,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said blood in the stool, for runners or any person, should be checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most common presenting symptom for someone with colon cancer is blood in their stool,” Cannon said. “That’s the most common reason we learn someone has polyps or cancer is because they’re bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said further research is underway, in examining this possible link. However, there could be other reasons extreme endurance athletes seem at risk of developing colon cancer at younger age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be the runners’ diets. It could be other aspects of their lifestyle that they have in common. It could be they drink from bottles with BPA or some other carcinogen more often than regular people,” who don’t engage in similar long-distance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cannon hopes that this preliminary study will prompt runners to get screening colonoscopies before the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think that it should raise awareness that any bleeding from a runner is a reason get a colonoscopy,  and not something to be ignored,” Cannon said. “Exercise is good, overall — please don’t use this as an excuse not to exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

Cottage cheese with fruit is the answer. Cottage cheese is creamy and satisfying all on its own, bu&lt;strong&gt;t pairing it with fruit adds fiber, nutrients and a touch of natural sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, cottage cheese’s mild, slightly tangy flavor complements all kinds of fruit — from juicy stone-fruits to crisp apples to sweet tropical varieties. With endless options, you can keep it seasonal or simply follow your cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the health benefits of cottage cheese?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/328841/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, just ⅔ cup of 2% cottage cheese serves up 151 mg of calcium (about 15% of the average adult's &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/calcium.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily calcium needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily calcium needs&lt;/a&gt; between age 19 and 50) and a solid 16 grams of protein. The result? A nutrient-dense win for both bones and muscles. It’s also rich in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Phosphorus-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phosphorus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, an essential mineral that supports strong, healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein is a macronutrient that can be tricky to get enough of since it often requires planning and cooking,” explains &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Davis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Davis&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a New Orleans-based dietitian. “Cottage cheese is an easy way to add it to your diet. And if you opt for a fermented variety, you’ll also get probiotics that support gut health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrative nutritionist and certified functional health expert &lt;a href="https://www.wellwithannie.com/about-me" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annie Mabashov;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annie Mabashov&lt;/a&gt; adds that cottage cheese is particularly rich in casein protein, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7451833/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:digests slowly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;digests slowly&lt;/a&gt; and provides a steady supply of amino acids, helping you feel full for longer. “This makes it a great choice for stabilizing blood sugar and supporting satiety,” she explains. “It’s not just for breakfast, either — having it in the evening can aid with overnight muscle repair. Plus, it’s naturally high in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:selenium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, an antioxidant and thyroid-supportive mineral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cottage cheese is a protein powerhouse on its own, but adding fruit makes it a well-rounded snack, meal, or even a dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pineapple&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love a sweet-and-savory combo, pineapple and cottage cheese is a must-try.

Try pairing it with kiwi, suggests Davis. “The tiny seeds add a light crunch that balances out the creaminess and for even more texture, you can sprinkle on some granola,” she says. “Kiwi is one of the most underrated fruits. It’s a vitamin C powerhouse — just two give you &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:100% of your daily needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;100% of your daily needs&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s high in fiber. It’s a really unique, refreshing pairing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pick a ripe kiwi, look for one that’s slightly soft to the touch. If the hard nub at the end comes off easily with your fingers, it’s ready; if you need a knife, it’s not quite there yet. For extra fiber, Davis also recommends keeping the skin on — just rinse and scrub well before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g64815628/fruits-high-in-magnesium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Magda Tymczyj - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mango&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango is another sweet, juicy tropical favorite that pairs well with mild, creamy cottage cheese. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2710833/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, potassium, copper, and magnesium, it’s as healthy as it is delicious.

Choosing organic helps cut down on exposure to synthetic pesticides and added hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for simple ingredients like milk, cream, salt and live cultures, which are great for gut health. Steer clear of additives and artificial flavors, which don’t add any real nutrition and can sometimes upset your stomach,” says Mabashov. “Also, check the protein and aim for at least 12 to 14 grams per half cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fat content, it’s really a personal choice that depends on your dietary requirements and goals. “Full-fat (4%) can be more satiating, contain more fat-soluble vitamins and keep blood sugar stable, whereas low-fat (2%) can be a good balance of creaminess and lighter calories,” explains Mabashov. “Fat-free often tastes chalky and may have extra stabilizers to make up for the texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: Cottage cheese is naturally higher in sodium. If you’re watching your heart health or blood pressure, look for lower sodium options — Mabashov recommends aiming for less than 300 milligrams of sodium per half cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:32:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE10N1V1UGxBQXlIaE1nbHhDd0ZMN2UwbjV1M2djZVFuZjlkXzZPeDl0ZFZLcTVPejh1NTJtdG4ydFBEMW4wNlVhUWRBZm1uUnFJLVlrUVMtVmJobWt6NFNFSTZ3WE1JWkptOU9CXzhxMnRhdk1VNkNuTVRB</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，您的年度眼科检查可以发现早期阿尔茨海默氏症- bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://bestlifeonline.com/eye-exam-could-detect-alzheimers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content noskimwords"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Did you know that 94 percent of people with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/vision-problems-alzheimers-news/"&gt;posterior cortical atrophy&lt;/a&gt; (PCA) problems develop Alzheimer’s disease? While the condition is rare, the link between ocular changes and cognitive decline isn’t. Previous studies have examined the impact of retinal vascular health on brain function—which supports theories that the eyes are a gateway to better understanding the brain. And now, scientists say a routine eye exam could detect signs of early Alzheimer’s before the onset of typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your eye health can say a lot about your brain health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the shape and size of your retinal blood vessels can indicate the presence of early Alzheimer’s, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia: Retinal vascular dysfunction in the Mthfr677C&amp;gt;T mouse model of cerebrovascular disease" href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70501" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the retina is an extension of the central nervous system—meaning, it shares “essentially the same tissue” as the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your retina is essentially your brain, but it’s much more accessible because your pupil is just a hole, and we can see tons of stuff,” co-lead study author &lt;strong&gt;Alaina Reagan&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, a neuroscientist at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), explained in a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095908" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “All the cells are very similar, all the neurons are quite similar, all the immune cells are quite similar, and they behave similarly under pressure if you’ve got a disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, your annual eye exam could also, potentially, serve as a brain health checkup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re at an optometrist or ophthalmologist appointment, and they can see odd vascular changes in your retina, that could potentially represent something that is also happening in your brain, which could be very informative for early diagnostics,” noted Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ppis-dementia-risk/"&gt;Doctors Warn This Common Medication May Be Linked to Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retinal vessels that look narrow or swollen could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at mice with the common genetic mutation “MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK,” which is a known Alzheimer’s risk variant. (The study also states that MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK occurs in up to 40 percent of humans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted a traditional eye exam and found abnormalities in the blood vessels and arteries of the mice. More specifically, the retinas appeared to have “twisted vessels, narrowed and swollen arteries, and less vessel branching.” These changes were detected in young mice starting at six months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted vessels “can result in turbulent blood flow, which promotes changes in blood pressure, degradation of elastin, and luminal shear stress,” wrote the authors. Additionally, it could be an underlying symptom of “poor blood flow and increased risk of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can see these wavy vessels in the retinas, which can occur in people with dementia,” Reagan said. “That speaks to a more systemic problem, not just a brain- or retina-specific problem. It could be a blood pressure problem affecting everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more is that female mice displayed worse eye health than their male peers. At one year old, they had “reduced vessel density and branching,” which the authors labeled as “progressive.” This corroborates a statistic from the Alzheimer’s Society that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/why-dementia-different-women" target="_blank"&gt;women have an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing Alzheimer’s in their lifetime, compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reagan, the study’s findings suggest “these systems in brain and retinal tissue are working in tandem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists say unusual changes in retinal blood vessels could serve as an early warning sign for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people over 50 have some kind of vision impairment and get checked annually for prescription changes,” said Reagan. “Are they more at risk if they have these vascular changes, and is that a point when doctors could start mitigating brain changes? That could be 20 years before cognitive damage becomes noticeable to patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team is partnering with dementia care experts from Maine’s Northern Light Acadia Hospital to study the correlation between mutation MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK and vascular changes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

Using these constructs, rAAV serotype 1 was produced by the Janelia Molecular Biology Core Facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-5HT3 (α7(L141G,G175K,Y210F,Y217F)–5HT3) or coca-GlyR (α7(L141G,G175K,Y217F)–GlyR) followed by IRES-mCherry were cloned into an AAV2 vector downstream of the &lt;i&gt;Syn&lt;/i&gt; promoter and were also packaged as AAV serotype 5 (Janelia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For electroporation and in vitro electrophysiology in CA1 pyramidal cells, mutant channel cDNAs were cloned into a pCAG expression vector with an upstream CAG promoter and a downstream IRES-GFP sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbering scheme used for ion channel amino acid residue positions is based on the unprocessed pre-protein sequence derived from the cDNA sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec8"&gt;Structural model of cocaine–LBD interactions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crystal structure of cocaine in a complex with AChBP was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2pgz/pdb"&gt;2PGZ&lt;/a&gt;). Amino acid substitutions were made in PyMol for residues near cocaine in the crystal structure for the homologous residues in the human protein sequence for display purposes. The model was used to guide exploration of residues to be mutated for effects on cocaine agonism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Ion-channel testing using a membrane potential assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATCC CRL-1573 cells (HEK293, passages 40–49) were plated into Corning CellBIND plates (10 cm diameter), at 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per plate and grown for 18–24 h to achieve about 80% confluency. Although the HEK293 cell line is frequently misidentified, we used obtained it directly from the ATCC and used these cells because the chimeric ion channels constructs are efficiently transfected and express well in this cell line. Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination. If contaminated cultures were detected, then they were not used for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To transfect cells, Opti-MEM (500 µl, Invitrogen), DNA plasmid (10 µg) and FuGene HD (30 µl, Roche) were combined, incubated for 15 min at room temperature and the mixture was then added dropwise to cells in a 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 8% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air. After an additional 18–20 h, the medium was aspirated and cells were rinsed (1× PBS, 5 ml), treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (3.0 ml, 5 min) and neutralized with DMEM + 10%FBS (7.0 ml). Cells were pooled, centrifuged (100&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 2 min) and resuspended in DMEM + 10% FBS then counted (Beckman Coulter Vi-Cell XR cell analyzer). Cells were then plated in 96 well BIOCOAT poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-lysine black/clear cellware with a cell density of 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; live cells in 200 µl per well. Cells were incubated another 22–26 h (37 °C in 8% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) then medium aspirated, and the FLIPR membrane potential assay solution was added and incubated at room temperature for approximately 20 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membrane potential assay solution was prepared with a bottle of Molecular Devices membrane potential assay kit–Blue (R8034) dissolved in 200 ml of HEPES-buffered Earle’s balanced salt solution (HEBSS). Drug compound plates were prepared in Nalge Nunc 96-well conical-bottom plates in HEBSS ( &amp;lt; 0.5% DMSO) and tested at concentration intervals from 0.1 µM to 100 µM. (&amp;lt;0.1% DMSO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamine and cocaine (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in saline to a 100 mM stock before making the dilution series. Nicotine was dissolved to 100 mM stock in saline from &amp;gt;99% liquid (Sigma-Aldrich). All of the other controlled substances were isolated in 1 mg quantities using the SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from Cerilliant ACS Chemical Standard solutions in methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and dissolved in DMSO stock to 100 mM. DMSO alone was also tested to ensure that there was no response at these dilutions. Endogenous amines for testing at coca-5HT3 (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09427-8#Fig7"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) were dissolved in saline to 100 mM stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure ion-channel activation, we used the Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 plate reader and liquid handling system. The assay plates were scanned at 1 Hz (excitation, 472/30 nm; emission, 540/40 nm). Compound solutions (50 µl) were simultaneously delivered from a 96-well compound plate after 10 baseline scans, which were followed by 170 additional scans. To calculate the MP EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the maximum response for each well was extracted, normalized to the maximum response for each compound and sigmoidal dose–response curves were calculated using software written in MATLAB (MathWorks Central: ec50.m, C. Evangelista, v.1.0, 14 January 2004) and the nlinfit function from the Statistics Toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;HEK293 cell electrophysiology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channel mutants and agonists were further characterized in whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments performed on HEK293 cells. At passage 44–48, cells were plated at low density (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-lysine-coated glass coverslips, then transfected in 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; wells using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche) with DNA plasmids containing both an ion channel cDNA (pcDNA3.1, 2 µg per well) and cDNA for GFP (pCMV, 0.1 μg per well), followed by replacement of the medium after 3 h. Recordings were made 24–72 h after transfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological recordings were performed in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode, on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-51) using pClamp software and a Multiclamp 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Electrophysiological data was filtered at 4 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1400 interface (Molecular Devices), recorded on a PC (Dell) and analysed using custom MATLAB software (MathWorks). Solutions were delivered from a gravity fed perfusion system through a capillary tube placed approximately 100 mm from the recorded cell using an eight-way manifold pinch valve system (Nanion), which was controlled from the acquisition software. This allowed for up to seven concentrations of agonist to be tested. The duration of agonist application was based on pilot experiments to determine the time required to reach a steady-state current response for the channel. External solution (HEBSS) contained 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The whole-cell pipette internal solution contained 87 mM CsGluconate, 31 mM CsCl, 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA and 3 mM MgATP. Osmolarities were within 285–305 mOsm l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the pH was adjusted to 7.3–7.4 with NaOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Electrophysiology of cultured hippocampal neurons and LHb acute brain slices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments and procedures complied with ethical regulations for animal testing and research and were approved by the Janelia Research Campus and UCSD animal care and use committees.

Hippocampi were dissected from postnatal day 0 neonatal rat pups (Charles River) in HEPES buffered Hank’s solution containing 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin. Tissue was dissociated in papain (Worthington, PAP2) in dissection buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. After digestion, papain was removed and tissue was dissociated in plating medium (MEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 28 mM glucose, 2.4 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; transferrin, 25 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; insulin, 2 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine, 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin). The cell suspension was passed through a 70 µm filter and centrifuged at 90&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 7 min. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in plating medium, counted and assayed for cell viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pCAG::coca-GlyR-IRES-GFP or pCAG::coca-5HT3-IRES-GFP plasmids were transfected by electroporation using the Lonza Nucleofector system (P3 Primary Cell 96-well Kit, Lonza) then cells were plated onto poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-lysine-coated 13 mm dia #1 glass coverslips in the wells of a 24-well plate at 50,000 cells per well. Each well received 60 µl of cell suspension plus 60 µl of NbActiv4 medium (BrainBits) and was incubated at 37 C in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 4 h for initial cell attachment. NbActiv4 medium (1 ml) was then added to each well and cultures kept for the duration of the experiment. Weekly medium changes were made by replacing 0.5 ml medium from each well with fresh NbActiv4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-cell recording internal solution contained 135 mM potassium gluconate, 6.7 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1.0 mM EGTA, 4.0 mM Na2ATP and 0.3 mM Na3GTP. The osmolarity was 285–305 mOsm l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the pH was within 7.3–7.4. Whole-cell recording pipettes had tip resistance between 1.5 and 4 MΩ and whole-cell series resistance was 6–29 MΩ (mean ± s.e.m., 17.2 ± 0.6 MΩ). The external solution contained: 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tight seals (&amp;gt;4 GΩ) were made in voltage-clamp mode and, immediately after patch disruption to establish the whole-cell recording configuration, the resting membrane potential was measured by switching briefly to the ‘I = 0’ mode on the Multiclamp Commander (Molecular Devices). After switching back to voltage-clamp mode, the other cell membrane properties were measured using the automated cell capacitance and membrane resistance compensation circuitry on the same device. Series resistance compensation was not applied. Membrane properties during current-clamp recordings were monitored by small current injections (−20 pA, 200 ms, 1 Hz). Thresholds for activation were estimated in current-clamp mode by injection of sequentially increasing depolarizing current steps (either 5 pA or 50 pA steps depending on whether a large shunt was observed due to chemogenetic receptor activation by cocaine). The threshold was measured as the amplitude of current injection that induced the first action potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of coca-5HT3 effects on the passive membrane properties of LHb neurons, C57BL/6J mice (male, aged 4–5 weeks) were injected with AAV5-Syn::coca-5HT3-IRES-mCherry (titre, 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; viral genomes (vg) per ml) or with a control virus AAV5-Syn::IRES-mCherry (titre: 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; vg per ml) in the LHb (anteroposterior (AP): −1.55 mm relative to bregma; mediolateral (ML): +0.45 mm; dorsoventral (DV): −2.65 mm, −2.75 mm, −2.85 mm, 100 nl at each depth). After 2–5 weeks, brain slices were prepared. In brief, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated and the brains removed in ice-cold sectioning solution (described below). The brains were then mounted onto a stage using Krazy Glue, and coronal brain slices (250 µm) were cut using a cooled tissue slicer (Leica 1200S). Slices were made in an ice-cold, low-sodium, low-calcium solution containing: 135 mM &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucamine, 2.2 mM KCl, 20 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.2 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 mM glucose, 0.25 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.75 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 113 mM HCl (HCl 25% solution, 6.85 M, 16.5 ml l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) then kept in recording saline, with 1 mM ascorbic acid and 2 mM pyruvic acid added, until needed (30 min to 5 h). &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Methyl-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucamine was used as a sodium replacement. Slices were held down in a glass-bottomed chamber, perfused and viewed on the stage of an upright Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope using infrared gradient contrast optics. Transfected neurons were identified by their mCherry fluorescence.

Sample sizes were estimated using G*Power or based on experience from past work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Open-field locomotion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were bilaterally injected (0.5 µl per side) with AAV5&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;Syn::coca-5HT3-IRES-mCherry in the LHb (10° angle, AP relative to bregma: −3.8 mm; ML, ±1.7 mm; DV, −5.2 mm) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6) or exposed to sham surgery (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6). Then, 4 weeks later, the rats were assessed for open-field locomotion. Each rat was placed in a clear Plexiglas box (40 cm × 40 cm × 30 cm) and activity was recorded by infrared beam brakes for 60 min (Opto-varimex ATM3, Columbus Instruments). The distance travelled was plotted as mean ± s.e.m. centimetres between the control and coca-5HT3 rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Sucrose preference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats from the open-field locomotor experiments were presented with two bottles of water in their home cage to acclimatize them to the procedure for 1 day. The next day, one bottle was replaced with a 1% sucrose solution dissolved in water. After 24 h, the consumed volume was noted in ml and the position of the bottles was switched to control for potential side preference. On day 3 the consumed volume was calculated for both water and sucrose 24 h after position switch. This volume was then plotted as percentage mean ± s.e.m. consumption between control and coca-5HT3 rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Sucrose pellet operant responding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were bilaterally injected (0.5 µl per side) with AAV5&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;Syn::coca-5HT3-IRES-mCherry in the LHb (10° angle; AP relative to bregma, −3.8 mm; ML, ±1.7 mm; DV, −5.2 mm) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8) or exposed to sham surgery (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5). Then, 4 weeks later, the rats were restricted to 18–20 g of chow per day and trained to press a lever for 20 mg sucrose pellets on an FR1 schedule (1 h per day for 7 days). Only the active lever was extended during the session. Presses on this lever activated the food magazine to dispense one pellet (Dustless Precision Pellets, F07595, 20 mg, Sucrose; Bio-Serv) accompanied by a 20 s cue light and timeout. Responses during the timeout period were recorded but did not result in pellets being dispensed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Dopamine levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats from the sucrose preference experiment were bilaterally injected (0.5 µl per side) with AAV5-Syn::coca-5HT3-IRES-mCherry in the LHb (10° angle; AP relative to bregma, −3.8 mm; ML, ±1.7 mm; DV, −5.2 mm) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6) or exposed to sham surgery (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6). Then, 6 weeks later, the rats were euthanized, and brain tissue was extracted and flash-frozen in isopentane. The tissue was then chunked, removing the olfactory bulbs and coronally sectioning at the optic chiasm. The tissue that contained the bilateral striatum was then homogenized and analysed for dopamine levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Abcam, ab285238). Dopamine levels were plotted as the mean ± s.e.m. pg per mg between control and coca-5HT3 rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Cocaine IVSA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male Long Evans rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2%). The rats were then placed onto a stereotaxic frame (Kopf) and injected with the AAV vector AAV5-Syn::coca-5HT3-IRES-mCherry (0.5 µl, 4.95 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; vg per ml) into the LHb (AP relative to bregma, −3.8 mm; ML, ±0.7 mm; DV, −5.25 mm, at a 10° angle) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) or underwent sham surgery (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1 week later, the rats were trained to self-administer food in daily operant sessions. For food training, rats were restricted to four large chow pellets per day and the body weight was monitored daily. Rats were tested for 10 days, and the sessions lasted for 3 h. For the first 5 days, the rats were tested using a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement and were then switched to an FR5 schedule for the 5 subsequent days. Each lever press led to delivery of a 45 mg food pellet (maximum of 200 pellets per session) and activation of a cue light above the lever for 1 s. Each reinforced lever press was followed by a 20 s timeout during which lever responses were recorded but had no programmed consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these operant sessions, the rats underwent surgery for jugular vein catheterization. The rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2%). Catheters made from Silastic tubing attached to a modified 22-gauge cannula (Plastics One, C313G-5up) and cemented to polypropylene mesh (Elko Filtering, 05–1000/45) were inserted into the jugular vein, and the mesh was fixed to the mid-scapular region of the rat. Rats were injected with carprofen (2.5 mg per kg, subcutaneous, Norbrook) after surgery and on the next day. Rats recovered for 6 days before self-administration procedures. Catheters were flushed daily with gentamicin (4.25 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Fresenius Kabi, 1002) dissolved in sterile saline. If catheter failure was suspected, catheter patency was tested with a short-acting barbiturate anaesthetic Brevital (methohexital sodium, 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in buffered saline, 0.1–0.2 ml injection volume, i.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After approximately 1 week, the rats began daily cocaine IVSA operant training sessions. Rats were tested using an FR1 schedule of reinforcement and were then switched to an FR5 schedule. In these sessions, a response on the lever previously paired with food had no programmed consequences (that is, inactive lever). A response on the cocaine-paired lever (that is, active lever) led to the infusion of a 0.5 mg per kg dose of cocaine (maximum of 60 infusions per session) and coincided with activation of a cue light located above the active lever for 20 s (that is, timeout period). During this time, lever responses were recorded but had no programmed consequences. After cocaine training, the rats were tested for IVSA using different cocaine unit doses (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg per kg per infusion). The procedures were identical to the initial sessions. The order of unit dose testing was randomized across rats.

The primers were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-ΔA-box F: 5′-CCAACAAGCCTCCCAAAGGTGATAAGAAGGG-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-ΔA-box R: 5′-TGGGAGGCTTGTTGGGGTCTCCTTTACC-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-ΔB-box F: 5′-CCAATGCTGCCAAGGGCAAAAGTGAAGC-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-ΔB-box R: 5′-CCTTGGCAGCATTGGGGTCCTTTTTCTTCCC-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-Δacidic tail F: 5′-CATATCGTGACCCAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAG-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2-Δacidic tail R: 5′-CTGGGTCACGATATGCAGCAATATCCTTTTC-3′&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Generation of stable cell lines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGB2&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;, HMGB2–GFP, HMGB2&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;, HMGB2&lt;sup&gt;del&lt;/sup&gt;, ATAT1&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; and FastFUCCI stable cell lines were generated by means of lentiviral transduction. The FastFUCCI reporter plasmid was obtained from Addgene (86849). The HMGB2–GFP reporter plasmid, HMGB2 gRNA+Cas9 plasmids, ATAT1 gRNA+Cas9 plasmids and non-targeting gRNA+Cas9 plasmids were assembled, as described above. The HMGB2&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt; plasmid was obtained from Horizon Discovery (OHS5897-202616132). Eight million HEK293T cells per condition were transfected with 1,200-ng lentiviral vector, 600-ng PAX2 plasmid and 300-ng MD2 plasmid using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN). Virus was collected starting 24 h after transfection. Viral supernatant was filtered (0.45-µm filter) before adding to A375 cells at a 1:1 ratio with medium and 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of polybrene. Cells were infected for 72 h, allowed to recover for 24 h and then selected using blasticidin (5 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 7–10 days) or puromycin (1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 3 days). For cell lines expressing a fluorescent reporter, cells were sorted using FACSAria III or FACSymphony S6 cell sorters (BD Biosciences). For HMGB2 overexpression and CRISPR lines, successful transduction was validated through western blot with an antibody targeting HMGB2 (MilliporeSigma; HPA053314). For ATAT1&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; lines, knockdown was validated through qPCR.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2 and Panc-1) were confined at a 5-µm height owing to their larger size. The cells were plated 6 h before imaging in fibronectin-coated glass-bottom 35-mm dishes (FluoroDish) or glass-bottom six-well plates (MatTek). The cells were allowed to attach before confinement was applied. Confined cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overnight. For live imaging, dyes plus 10 µM verapamil were added to the plated cells 2–3 h before imaging. The dyes used for live imaging were SiR-tubulin (Spirochrome; 100 nM) and SiR-DNA (Spirochrome; 250 nM). Pharmacological inhibitors were added immediately before applying confinement. The inhibitors used were Taxol (Tocris; 1097), tubacin (Selleck Chemicals; S2239), nocodazole (Tocris; 1228) and trichostatin A (MilliporeSigma; T8552). Live imaging was performed on an LSM 880 (ZEISS) confocal microscope at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at ×63 magnification and 5–10 min of temporal resolution, using ZEN Black v.2.3 SP1 software (ZEISS). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature before proceeding with staining and imaging, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;In vitro proliferation and invasion assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CyQUANT Direct Red Cell Proliferation Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific; C35013) was used to assay cell proliferation. Cells were plated at a density of 500 cells per well in 96-well plates and allowed to grow for 72 h. The cell number was quantified using the CyQUANT Direct Red Nuclei Acid Stain and Background Suppressor added at a 1:1 ratio to the cell culture medium, and the intensity was read out at 622 nm on a plate reader. For invasion assays, VitroGel Cell Invasion Assay Kit (TheWell Bioscience; IA-VHM01-1P) and Cultrex Collagen I Cell Invasion Assay kit (Bio-Techne; 3457-096-K) were used. The cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM, plated in the upper chamber of the invasion assay insert and allowed to migrate for 18 h. The cell number was quantified using crystal violet or calcein staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining and imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were plated on glass CC2-coated chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or fibronectin-coated glass-bottom dishes (FluoroDish) and allowed to attach for approximately 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS and blocked in 10% goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-HMGB2 (Abcam; ab124670), rabbit anti-HMGB1 (Abcam; ab18256), rabbit anti-HMGA1 (Abcam; ab129153), mouse anti-α-tubulin (MilliporeSigma; CP06), chick anti-β-tubulin (Novus Biologicals; NB100-1612), mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (MilliporeSigma; 6793), rabbit anti-acetylated tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology (CST); 5335), rat anti-tyrosinated tubulin (MilliporeSigma; MAB1864-I), mouse anti-polyglutamylated tubulin (MilliporeSigma; T9822), mouse anti-GFP (Abcam; ab1218), rabbit anti-H3Ac (MilliporeSigma; 06-599), mouse anti-Annexin V (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-74438), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (CST; 9661), rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (CST; 5625), rabbit anti-YAP (CST; 14074), mouse anti-Twist (Abcam; ab50887), rabbit anti-Snail (CST; 3879), rabbit anti-SMAD3 (Abcam; ab40854) and rabbit anti-SYNE2 (Abcam; ab204308). All primary antibodies were used at 1:200. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody (1:250). Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated phalloidin (CST; 8878S), when used, was added at 1:50, and Hoechst was added at 1:1,000. The cells were mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and allowed to cure overnight. Stained cells were imaged on a ZEISS LSM 880 confocal at ×40 or ×63 resolution using ZEN Black v.2.3 SP1 software (ZEISS). A Gaussian blur with a radius of 0.5–0.75 pixels was occasionally applied to images to reduce noise for visualization purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Staining of human tumour samples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human melanoma tissue microarrays were obtained from TissueArray.Com (Me481f). Slides were baked at 60 °C for 20 min and deparaffinized in consecutive xylene and ethanol washes. Antigen retrieval was performed using 1X IHC Antigen Retrieval Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 00-4955-58) heated at 95 °C for 20 min in a pressure cooker. After washing in PBS, the samples were blocked in 10% goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature before incubation overnight at 4 °C in the following primary antibodies, all diluted in blocking buffer at 1:200: rabbit anti-HMGB2 (Abcam; ab124670) and mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (MilliporeSigma; 6793). After washing in PBS, the slides were incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody (1:250) and Hoechst (1:1,000). After washing in PBS, a final incubation was performed with a fluorescently conjugated rabbit anti-S100a6 antibody (Abcam; ab204028; 1:250) to label tumour cells before mounting the slides in VECTASHIELD. The slides were imaged on a Pannoramic slide scanner (3DHISTECH) using a ×20/0.8 numerical aperture objective, with higher-resolution images acquired on an LSM 880 confocal (ZEISS), as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Image analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images were analysed using CellProfiler&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Stirling, D.

For images of fixed cells, the cells were segmented in CellProfiler using Hoechst staining to generate a nuclei mask and phalloidin or other cytoskeletal staining to generate a whole-cell mask. The mean intensity per cell/nucleus was quantified, and expression of nuclear-localized proteins was normalized to Hoechst intensity per nucleus. For quantification of live imaging data, HMGB2–GFP intensity per cell over time was quantified using TrackMate. The resulting intensity data were analysed in MATLAB by fitting a line to each curve and automatically removing curves in which more than four data points differed from the line of best fit by more than 0.2 a.u. In all cases, plotting and statistics were done in MATLAB. The images were assembled for figure preparation using Fiji (v.2.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A375 cells expressing HMGB2–GFP were confined for approximately 18 h before FRAP measurements. FRAP was done on an LSM 880 confocal at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using a ×63 oil immersion lens and ZEN Black v.2.3 SP1 software (ZEISS). A 5-µm circular diameter region of interest was defined within the nucleus of each cell before photobleaching at 405 nm and 488 nm wavelengths for ten pulses. One time point was acquired before photobleaching. Fluorescence recovery was imaged at 0.2-s intervals for a total of 20 s. All analyses were performed in MATLAB. For analysis, fluorescence within the region of interest was normalized to the fluorescence at the initial time point (before photobleaching). Samples in which the fluorescence within the region of interest was not bleached to at least 25% of the pre-bleaching value were automatically removed from the analysis. Each recovery curve was fitted with a two-component exponential using the function ‘fit’ with the ‘exp2’ parameter: &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) = &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;0 + &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1 − &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1 − &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;0 represents the fluorescence immediately after photobleaching, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the amplitude of the fast-diffusing population, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the amplitude of the slow-diffusing population, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is time and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;1 and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;2 correspond to the time constants for the fast-diffusing and slow-diffusing populations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Atomic force microscopy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were plated on glass-bottom Petri dishes (FluoroDish FD35) and confined for 18 h, as described above. Immediately after removing the dish from the confiner, cell stiffness was measured using a NanoWizard V microscope (JPK Bruker) in QI Advanced mode. The samples were maintained at 37 °C during imaging using the PetriDishHeater (Bruker). For cell stiffness mapping, 1-μm-diameter spherical AFM probe (silicon nitride cantilever; nominal spring constant &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2 N m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; SAA-SPH-1UM; Bruker) was used. Each spring constant of the AFM probe was measured using the thermal noise method in liquid at 37 °C. For the stiffness mapping, a 2 nN set point was used (60 μm × 60 μm image size with 32 × 32 pixels of resolution) to ensure up to 10–20% sample indentation to avoid glass surface influence. The data were processed with JPK Data Processing software using the Hertz model with 0.5 Poisson ratio as a fit parameter. To calculate nuclear stiffness, force maps were segmented on the basis of the corresponding cell height measurements to extract the nuclear region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;TurboID experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Generation of TurboID constructs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloning of TurboID constructs and validation was performed, as described in a previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Cho, K.

For TurboID–HMGB2, the TurboID cassette was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pENTR–HMGB2 at the N terminus of HMGB2 using In-Fusion Cloning. For nuclear localization signal–TurboID, an entry vector was assembled using In-Fusion Cloning, containing the TurboID cassette, followed by three consecutive nuclear localization signal sequences. The pENTR–TurboID–HMGB2 and pENTR–TurboID–3XNLS constructs were subcloned into the pLX304 backbone by Gateway cloning using LR Clonase II Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Stable A375 cell lines were generated, as described above, and expression and localization of the TurboID fusion protein were confirmed by immunofluorescence targeting haemagglutinin (found at the N terminus of the TurboID cassette). The TurboID activity was validated by pulsing the cells with 10 mM biotin (MilliporeSigma; 1071508), followed by both western blotting and immunofluorescence using fluorescently labelled streptavidin. IRDye 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR; 926-32230) was used for western blotting, and streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; S11223) or Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; S21381) was used for immunofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Sample preparation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mass spectrometry experiments, ten million cells per condition and replicate were plated in 15-cm dishes. The medium was removed from the dishes and replaced with 10 mM biotin for 1 h. The labelling reaction was stopped by placing the dishes on ice and washing the cells five times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then detached by scraping in ice-cold PBS and then pelleted and resuspended in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer + protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed by means of sonication (10% amplitude; 2 s per cycle; six cycles), and Bradford assay was used to measure the protein concentration. For each sample, 1-mg protein was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 88817) in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The next day, the beads were pelleted using a magnetic rack, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed once in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) and twice in 2 M urea in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Protein digestion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beads were resuspended in 80 ml of 2 M urea and 50 mM EPPS (pH 8.5) and treated with &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;-dithiothreitol (1 mM final concentration) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking (1,100 rpm) on a Thermomixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Free cysteine residues were alkylated with 2-iodoacetamide (3.67 mM final concentration) for 45 min at 25 °C at 1,100 rpm in the dark. The reaction was quenched using 3.67 mM dithiothreitol, and LysC (750 ng) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C at 1,150 rpm. Finally, trypsin (750 ng) was added, followed by incubation for 16 h at 37 °C at 1,150 rpm. After incubation, the digest was acidified to pH less than 3 with the addition of 50% of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and the peptides were desalted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). Briefly, the cartridges were conditioned by sequential addition of (1) 100% methanol; (2) 70% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA; and (3) 5% ACN/0.1% TFA twice. After conditioning, the acidified peptide digest was loaded onto the cartridge. The stationary phase was washed with 5% ACN/0.1% formic acid twice. Finally, peptides were eluted using 70% ACN/0.1% formic acid twice. Eluted peptides were dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac centrifuge followed by reconstitution in 12 μl of 0.1% formic acid, sonication and transfer to an autosampler vial. Peptide yield was quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Mass spectrometry&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptides were separated on a 25-cm column with a 75-mm diameter and 1.7-mm particle size composed of C18 stationary phase (IonOpticks; Aurora 3 1801220) using a gradient from 2% to 35% B over 90 min and then to 95% B for 7 min (buffer A, 0.1% formic acid in high-performance liquid chromatography-grade water; buffer B, 99.9% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) with a flow rate of 300 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; using a nanoElute 2 system (Bruker). Mass spectrometry data were acquired on a timsTOF HT (Bruker) with a CaptiveSpray source (Bruker) using a data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation (PASEF) method (dia-PASEF). The mass range was set from 100 to 1700 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;, and the ion mobility range was set from 0.60 V s cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (collision energy of 20 eV) to 1.6 V s cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (collision energy of 59 eV) with a ramp time of 100 ms and an accumulation time of 100 ms. The dia-PASEF settings included a mass range of 400.0–1,201.0 Da, mobility range of 0.60–1.60 and a cycle time estimate of 1.80 s. The dia-PASEF windows were set with a mass width of 26.00 Da, mass overlap of 1.00 Da and 32 mass steps per cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw data files were processed using Spectronaut v.18.5 (Biognosys) and searched with the Pulsar search engine with a human UniProt protein database downloaded on 15 August 2023 (226,261 entries). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was specified as a fixed modification, whereas methionine oxidation, acetylation of the protein N terminus and deamidation (NQ) were set as variable modifications. A maximum of two trypsin missed cleavages were permitted. Searches used a reversed sequence decoy strategy to control peptide FDR, and 1% FDR was set as the threshold for identification. Unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test was used to calculate &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value in differential analysis, and volcano plot was generated on the basis of log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FC and &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value (multiple testing corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value using Benjamini–Hochberg method). A &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value ≤ 0.05 was considered the statistically significant cut-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Mouse experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse in vivo studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research Animal Resource Center. The mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions, in an environment with controlled temperature (21.5 °C ± 1.5 °C) and humidity (55% ± 10%) and under 12 h light/dark cycles. For the drug efficacy studies, 6-week-old to 8-week-old athymic female mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected subcutaneously with five million A375 cells in a 50:50 mix with Matrigel (Corning). Once tumours reached an average volume of 100 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the mice were randomized into two treatment groups (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4–6 mice per group) to receive either a vehicle control or trametinib (1 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) in combination with dabrafenib (30 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Both drugs were delivered through oral gavage daily five times for 3 weeks. The mice were observed daily throughout the treatment period for signs of morbidity/mortality. Tumours were measured twice weekly using calipers, and volume was calculated using the following formula: length × width&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 0.52. Body weight was also assessed twice weekly. For the HMGB2 deletion construct growth curve studies, tumour cells were implanted, as described above, and tumour volume was measured twice weekly. The animals were monitored until their tumour size reached 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, at which point tumours were collected, fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h, transferred to 70% ethanol and processed for histology. In accordance with limits established by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the mice were euthanized when tumour burden exceeded 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These limits were not exceeded in any of the experiments. Histology was performed by HistoWiz using the following antibodies for immunohistochemistry: mouse anti-BRAF&lt;sup&gt;V600E&lt;/sup&gt; (Abcam; ab228461) and rabbit anti-acetylated tubulin (Abcam; ab179484). Two biological replicates consisting of four to six mice per condition (for a total of 10–11 mice per group) were performed for both experiments. No sample size calculation or blinding was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Bulk RNA-seq and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For bulk RNA-seq of A375 and SKMEL5 cells overexpressing HMGB2, three replicates of approximately one million cells each were pelleted and resuspended in TRIzol before snap freezing. For bulk RNA-seq of confined A375 cells, 200,000 cells were plated in each well of a six-well plate. Three wells were confined for approximately 18 h using a six-well static confiner (4Dcell) at 3-µm height, whereas the remaining three wells were left unconfined. The cells were then collected in TRIzol, pooling the three wells for each condition to generate samples of approximately 600,000 cells each. This process was repeated for a total of three independent biological replicates per condition. Library preparation and sequencing were done by Azenta Life Sciences.

The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to the final concentration of 0.125 M. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in SDS buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche). The resulting nuclei were spun down, resuspended in the immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA and 5% Triton X-100) at 1 ml per 0.5 million cells mixed in 2:1 ratio, with the addition of 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma; 11836170001). The nuclei were processed on a Covaris E220 Focused-ultrasonicator to achieve an average fragment length of 200–300 bp with the following parameters: peak incident power = 140, duty factor = 5, cycles per burst/burst per second = 200 and time = 20 min (for A375 cells) or 45 min (for SKMEL5 cells). Chromatin concentrations were estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 23227) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The immunoprecipitation reactions were set up in 500 µl of the immunoprecipitation buffer in Protein LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf; 22431081) and pre-cleared with 50 µl of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10004D) for 2 h at 4 °C. After pre-clearing, the samples were transferred into new Protein LoBind Tubes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 µg of HMGB2 (Abcam; ab67282), V5 (Abcam; ab9116; used for SKMEL5 ChIP only) and H3K4me3 (Epicypher; 13-0041) antibodies. For normalization purposes, 5 µl of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; spike-in chromatin (Active Motif; 53083) and 2 µl of spike-in antibody (Active Motif; 61686) were added to each reaction. The next day, 50 µl of BSA-blocked Dynabeads Protein G was added to each reaction and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with low-salt washing buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)), twice with high-salt washing buffer (500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA and 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)), twice with LiCL wash buffer (250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1% Na deoxycholate and 1% IGEPAL CA-630) and once with TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA). The samples were then reverse-crosslinked overnight in the elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and purified using the ChIP DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator kit (Zymo Research; D5205) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After quantification of the recovered DNA fragments, libraries were prepared using the ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Kit (Takara Bio; R400676) following the manufacturer’s instructions, purified with SPRIselect magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter; B23318) and quantified using a Qubit Flex fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and profiled using TapeStation (Agilent). The libraries were sent to MSKCC Integrated Genomics Operation core facility for sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (approximately 30–40 million 100-bp paired-end reads per library).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChIP–seq reads were trimmed and filtered for quality and library adaptors using TrimGalore (v.0.4.5) with a quality setting of 15 and running cutadapt&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 76" title="Martin, M.

A peak atlas was created by combining the superset of all peaks using the ‘merge’ function in the BEDTools suite (v.2.29.2). Read density profiles were created using deepTools ‘bamCoverage’ (v.3.3.0), normalized to ten million uniquely mapped reads and with read pile-ups extended to 200 bp. The tool featureCounts (v.1.6.1) was used to build a raw count matrix, and DESeq2 was used to calculate the differential enrichment for all pairwise contrasts for experiments with replicates. For single-sample data, MACS2 was run by swapping bams of different conditions to find differential regions. Peak gene associations were created by assigning all intragenic peaks to that gene, whereas intergenic peaks were assigned using the linear genomic distance to the transcription start site.
