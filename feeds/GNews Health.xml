		&lt;p&gt;Noise is the wallpaper of modern life. It’s there when you wake, when you work, when you try to fall asleep. Most of it is harmless in isolation, yet together it becomes something else: a steady press on your nervous system, a kind of invisible weather. You don’t notice how tense your shoulders are until a door slams. You don’t realise how shallow your breathing has become until the room goes quiet. This is the hidden risk of everyday noise — not the single blast, but the drip, drip, drip of sound stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus sighed past my window at 6:41 a.m., tyres whispering on wet tarmac. Someone upstairs dropped a spoon and laughed, a kettle clicked on, a phone vibrated somewhere with that needy bee-hum. I watched the steam rise and felt my heart drumming harder than the moment deserved. A scooter buzzed the lights. The fridge hummed like a thought I couldn’t put down. It wasn’t loud, not exactly. But it stacked. We’ve all had that moment when the small sounds add up to a big feeling. Then the kettle screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The quiet crisis in our ears&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary noise doesn’t feel like danger, yet your body doesn’t ask nicely. It reacts. The rustle of traffic, the ping of a message, the neighbour’s subwoofer at lunchtime — these layers prime the stress system to stay on. Muscles clench, cortisol nudges higher, attention frays by noon. You reach for coffee and headphones and call it coping. &lt;strong&gt;Noise doesn’t only live in your ears; it lives in your nervous system.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not dramatic. It’s cumulative. A background bias toward alertness that steals bandwidth you thought you still had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask Maria, who works from a flat by the ring road. Her smartwatch shows a higher resting heart rate on weekdays and better sleep on the few nights traffic is lighter. That tracks with public-health data: long-term environmental noise has been tied to higher risks of heart disease and anxiety, especially when night-time noise breaks slumber. A normal conversation sits around 60 dB. A vacuum cleaner lives near 70 dB. A blender can spike to 90 dB. Because decibels are logarithmic, a 10 dB jump roughly feels twice as loud. Small shifts matter. So do the hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s really going on. Your brain is a prediction machine. Sounds that are unpredictable or that you can’t control keep it scanning for what’s next. That scanning has a cost. It soaks up attention, feeds a low simmer of fight-or-flight, and heightens pain and irritability. Stress loves company, so fatigue and noise egg each other on. Open-plan offices, busy streets, the endless digital chorus — each adds a few points of strain. Headphones help, but they can also mask the issue if you simply add more sound on top of sound. Quiet isn’t silence. It’s certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What actually helps, today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a sound diet. You need some, you want some, and you benefit from choosing what, when, and how much. Start with three levers: intensity, duration, and meaning. Lower intensity at the source: shut doors softly, put felt pads under chair legs, add a rug. Trim duration by creating a few “quiet slots” — 10 minutes without audio before your first caffeine, 5 minutes after lunch to breathe with longer exhales, one hour device-free before bed. Change the meaning by labelling a noise (“that’s the 7:10 bus, it passes”) which can dial down the body’s threat meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common traps are understandable. Cranking white noise too loud to drown a busy street, wearing earplugs all day until normal sounds feel jarring, or blasting music to concentrate. Instead, keep white or brown noise low, just below speech level, and use it like a dimmer, not a wall. Alternate earplugs with “open” time to keep your system flexible. Use noise-cancelling on trains, then flip to ambient mode when walking. Set “sound boundaries” at home: music on speakers between set hours, headphones afterward. Let’s be honest: nobody does that every day. Try it most days and you’ll still feel the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the gentler layer: how your body receives sound. Slow breathing with longer exhales signals safety. So does warmth, literally a cup of tea cupped in both hands. A short body scan can reduce the “noise of noise” by quieting the brain’s alarm. It’s like a fingertip to the temple. You’re not trying to win silence. You’re trying to turn down the “threat” knob while the world keeps moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiet is not the absence of sound, it’s the presence of safety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce at source: soft close, soft surfaces, soft voices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase distance: move the speaker, move your chair, close a door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add absorption: curtains, rugs, bookshelves break up echo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage timing: create daily quiet slots like meetings with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset your body: longer exhale breathing, stretch, step outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect kindly: use earplugs and ANC in bursts, not all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A gentler way to hear the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason a quiet library feels medicinal and a Sunday morning city can feel like a hug. When sound gets predictable and soft, your nervous system stands down and gives you back your focus. You can’t change the traffic or teach next door to levitate. You can change the way your day handles sound, the way your space absorbs it, the way your body interprets it. It’s small, almost boring, which is why it works. Tidy one corner of your soundscape and the rest starts to follow. Share a quiet coffee. Walk without earbuds. Leave one window for birdsong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Everyday noise acts like a micro-stressor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unpredictable, uncontrollable sounds keep the brain on alert, raising stress load and draining focus over time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explains why you feel tired, edgy, or unfocused even on “quiet” days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small changes compound into relief&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lower intensity, shorten duration, and shift meaning with simple tweaks at home and work&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quick wins you can try today without buying fancy gear&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Protect ears without overprotecting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use earplugs and noise-cancelling in bursts, keep white noise low, mix in true quiet time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stay comfortable now and resilient later, avoiding sensitivity rebound&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What counts as “too loud” at home?&lt;/strong&gt;Conversation is roughly 60 dB. If you need to raise your voice to speak at arm’s length, it’s likely above 70 dB and worth reducing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can everyday noise really make me ill?&lt;/strong&gt;Long-term exposure has been linked to higher stress, poor sleep, and increased cardiovascular risk. The mix of loudness, duration, and timing matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is white noise safe for sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;Keep it low, steady, and simple. Aim just below speech level and avoid harsh, high-pitched hiss. Brown or pink noise can feel softer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are noise-cancelling headphones okay all day?&lt;/strong&gt;Great in bursts for travel or focus. Alternate with ambient mode or silent breaks so your ears and brain stay adaptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I talk to a noisy neighbour without a row?&lt;/strong&gt;Pick a calm time, describe one clear impact (“the bass carries into our bedroom at 11”), and suggest a fix (“could we keep bass lower after 10?”). Offer reciprocity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DREAM database pools 2,643 sleep recordings from 505 people across 20 studies, creating the world’s largest collection of brain activity data paired with dream reports.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dreams aren’t just a REM sleep phenomenon. Analysis revealed dream reports occurred 88% of the time in light sleep, 56% in moderate sleep, 48% in deep sleep, and 81% during REM sleep.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers can predict dreaming from brain waves alone with up to 70% accuracy in REM sleep, suggesting objective markers of subjective dream experiences exist in measurable brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The database remains open to new contributions and could help answer fundamental questions about consciousness, from why some people rarely remember dreams to detecting awareness in unresponsive patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have assembled the largest collection of dream data ever created, pooling more than 2,600 sleep recordings from 505 people across 20 different studies. The Dream EEG and Mentation (DREAM) database offers an exciting new approach to studying one of neuroscience’s most elusive puzzles: what happens in our brains when we dream?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dream research&lt;/a&gt; has been hampered by a fundamental problem. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep studies&lt;/a&gt; require expensive equipment, trained technicians, and participants willing to spend nights in laboratories while being repeatedly awakened. Most research groups could afford to collect only dozens of observations, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the sleeping brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the DREAM database changes that equation. By standardizing data from institutions worldwide and making it openly accessible, researchers have created a resource that no single laboratory could build alone. Each recording captures both the electrical activity of a sleeping brain and detailed reports of what the person experienced upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-a-common-language-for-dream-research"&gt;Creating a Common Language for Dream Research&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major obstacle the project addressed was inconsistency across laboratories. Different research groups used different methods to collect and categorize dreams. Some studies relied on detailed questionnaires, others collected free-form verbal descriptions, and many employed different definitions of what counts as a dream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database introduced three standardized categories. “Experience” indicates the person recalled specific dream content. “Experience without recall” captures the phenomenon of knowing you dreamed but being unable to remember details, sometimes called white dreams. “No experience” means the person reported neither dreams nor any impression of having dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This common framework allows researchers to combine observations from studies that might have seemed incompatible. A lab studying nightmares in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/transcendental-meditation-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;patients with PTSD&lt;/a&gt; can now compare their data with findings from healthy volunteers learning spatial tasks, or from experiments on lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-decades-of-sleep-data-in-one-place"&gt;Two Decades of Sleep Data in One Place&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database spans studies conducted from the early 2000s through 2024, encompassing diverse experimental designs. Some datasets come from multiple awakenings throughout single nights. Others capture morning reports after full nights of sleep. Several studies recorded &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-teens-tired-violent-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daytime naps&lt;/a&gt;. One unique dataset includes simultaneous EEG and magnetoencephalography, offering complementary views of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participant demographics range widely. The youngest were children aged 9-14 with developmental dyslexia or matched controls. The oldest were &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/older-adults-who-eat-breakfast-early-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy adults in their sixties and seventies&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies focused on frequent sleep talkers, others on people trained to signal lucid dreams through eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of 1,550 awakenings with complete sleep stage and dream report data revealed clear patterns. Stage N1, the lightest non-REM stage, produced dream reports 88% of the time. Stage N2 yielded dreams in 56% of awakenings. Deep sleep dropped to 48% dream recall. REM sleep generated dream reports 81% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dreams occur during multiple stages of slumber, not just REM sleep. (Credit: Oliga on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers confirm what many sleep researchers suspected but struggled to prove: dreams are not exclusive to REM sleep. Reports of conscious experiences accompanied about 40-60% of non-REM awakenings, depending on sleep depth and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/disrupted-sleep-memory-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time of night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quality-standards-enable-global-collaboration"&gt;Quality Standards Enable Global Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contributing a dataset required meeting specific technical benchmarks. Recordings needed at least two EEG electrodes positioned according to standard placement systems, a minimum of 20 seconds of continuous sleep before awakening, and sampling rates of at least 100 Hz. Data had to be in raw or minimally preprocessed form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each dataset underwent both automated and manual quality checks. Curators verified proper file structure, correct data formatting, and consistency in metadata. Sleep recordings with more than 10 seconds of artifacts in the final 20 seconds before awakening were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database stores polysomnography data in European Data Format files, with each file containing the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; leading up to a dream report. Metadata for each awakening includes the dream classification, sleep stage, participant demographics when available, and experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contributors retain control over access levels for their data. Some datasets are fully open access. Others require researchers to request permission from the original authors, depending on what ethics committees approved for each study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-findings-point-to-objective-dream-markers"&gt;Early Findings Point to Objective Dream Markers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the resource’s potential, the research team conducted several analyses. They applied automatic sleep scoring algorithms to six datasets that met strict quality criteria, achieving accuracy above 72% compared to human expert scoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The algorithms generated probability distributions across possible sleep stages rather than single labels. Analysis of these probabilities showed that brain activity during non-REM sleep with dream reports carried higher probability of wake-like patterns compared to non-REM sleep without dreams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also tested whether they could predict dream experiences from brain wave patterns alone. Using both traditional frequency analysis and advanced techniques designed to capture complex signals, they distinguished dreaming from non-dreaming states with better-than-chance accuracy in both REM and non-REM sleep. For &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-rewiring-teen-brains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the most sophisticated analysis reached 70% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results suggest objective markers of subjective dream experiences exist in measurable brain activity. The database provides the scale needed to identify such markers reliably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-the-database-could-help-answer"&gt;Questions the Database Could Help Answer&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team outlined several fundamental questions that the expanding database might address. Why are we sometimes conscious and sometimes unconscious during sleep? Why do some people remember dreams every day while others rarely recall them? What makes the small percentage of people who regularly have &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brain-during-lucid-dreaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lucid dreams&lt;/a&gt; different from the rest?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep research also connects to broader questions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; in other states. Patients diagnosed with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome cannot provide behavioral reports, making it difficult to determine whether they experience awareness. Similarly, determining the depth of general anesthesia needed to prevent intraoperative awareness remains a challenge. Some patients who experience awareness during surgery describe it as similar to dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database could serve as a testing ground for methods to detect consciousness in the absence of reports. Techniques validated on sleeping, dreaming brains might transfer to these other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-resource-built-to-grow"&gt;A Resource Built to Grow&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database remains open to new contributions and will continue expanding. The core team, drawn from institutions in Australia, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, maintains the collection on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/volunteering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a voluntary basis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers can search and browse metadata without downloading large data files, making it easier to identify relevant recordings for specific research questions. The standardized format allows automated analysis pipelines to process data from multiple studies without extensive reformatting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project aligns with a broader movement toward data sharing in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. Similar collaborative databases have accelerated progress in other fields, from the Allen Institute for Brain Science to the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience. Until this project, dream research lacked a comparable resource.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial release of 2,643 awakenings represents a starting point. As more research groups contribute their recordings, the database will grow in both size and diversity, potentially transforming how scientists study the sleeping, dreaming brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database aggregates polysomnography recordings and dream reports from 20 separate studies contributed by research institutions worldwide. Each included awakening consists of sleep EEG/MEG recording (minimum 20 seconds, 100 Hz sampling, 2+ electrodes) up to the moment of waking, plus a standardized classification of the reported experience. Contributors mapped their original dream categorization systems to three standard classifications: “Experience” (recalled specific content), “Experience without recall” (impression of dreaming without remembered details), and “No experience” (no dream reported or impression of dreaming). The initial release contains 2,643 awakenings from 505 participants. For analysis, researchers selected six datasets meeting quality criteria and extracted power spectral density features plus catch22 time-series features from three common electrodes (F4, C4, O2). Classification models attempted to discriminate “Experience” from “No experience” reports within NREM and REM sleep separately using cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database confirmed dependence between sleep stage and dream experience with high statistical significance (chi-squared test, p&amp;lt;10^-15). Dream recall frequency decreased with NREM sleep depth, with 88% recall in N1, 56% in N2, 48% in N3, and 81% in REM. Generalized linear mixed-effects modeling accounting for study and participant grouping confirmed deeper NREM stages associated with lower odds of dream experience reports. Analysis of 1,462 thirty-second pre-awakening epochs showed automatic sleep scoring achieved average accuracy above 0.72 compared to human scoring. Bayesian ANOVA on automatically-scored sleep stage probabilities (hypnodensities) revealed both main effects of sleep stage and dream report category, with an interaction between them. NREM epochs with dream experiences showed increased probability mass toward wake-like activity. Classification models successfully discriminated dream experience from no experience in both NREM (best AUC=0.586 using power spectral density) and REM (best AUC=0.700 using catch22 features on band-filtered signals), with all results significantly above chance (Bonferroni-corrected p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dream reports depend on waking participants, which interrupts sleep and may be affected by sleep inertia, confusion, and memory decay. Report quality and comprehensiveness diminish with time. The database aggregates studies with methodological and conceptual variability in experimental protocols, awakening procedures, and original dream categorization schemes. Not all contributed datasets provided identical metadata or raw dream report text. Some datasets required reclassification or mapping to standard categories, which introduces potential inconsistencies. The prediction analysis used only six datasets meeting strict equipment and demographic criteria, excluding studies with non-standard EEG systems, sensory stimulation protocols, or participants outside typical adult age ranges. Analysis focused on a limited number of electrode positions common across studies rather than full high-density recordings. Manual sleep scoring sometimes labels epochs as “Wake” before participants report being asleep, representing subjective-objective discrepancies that complicate interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

                The Tdap vaccine protects against whooping cough (pertussis), which is particularly dangerous for infants. Because infants can't get their first vaccination against pertussis until they are 2 months old, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated in the third trimester, in order to pass immunity to their newborns.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When there's an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease, state health officials typically take certain steps to alert residents and issue public updates about the growing threat. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's standard practice, public health and infectious disease experts told NPR and KFF Health News. The goal is to keep as many other vulnerable people as possible from getting sick and to remind the public about the benefits of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But in Louisiana this year, public health officials appeared not to have followed that playbook during the state's worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that's particularly dangerous for the youngest infants. It can cause vomiting and trouble breathing, and serious infections can lead to pneumonia, seizures and, rarely, death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Madison Flake, a pediatric resident in Baton Rouge, La., cared for a baby who was hospitalized during this year's outbreak. At less than 2 months old, he was sent to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He would have these bouts of very dramatic coughing spells," Flake said. "He would stop breathing for several seconds to almost a minute."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;2 months old&lt;/a&gt;, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By late January 2025, two babies had died in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Louisiana Department of Health waited two months to send out a social media post suggesting people talk to their doctors about getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The department took even longer to issue a statewide &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;health alert&lt;/a&gt; to physicians, send out a press release or hold a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those delays are not typical, according to &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/about-apha/executive-board-and-staff/apha-staff/georges-c-benjamin-md" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Georges Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Public Health Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Particularly for these childhood diseases, we usually jump all over these," said Benjamin, who has led health departments in Maryland and the District of Columbia. "These are preventable diseases and preventable deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because infectious diseases spread exponentially, if officials don't alert the public quickly, they lose a key chance to prevent further infections, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/abraar-karan" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor on infectious diseases at Stanford University who has worked on COVID-19 and mpox outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Time is perhaps one of the most important currencies that you have," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Amid outbreak, state surgeon general stopped state promotion of all vaccines &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because pertussis vaccine immunity wanes over time, cases can ebb and flow over time. But in September 2024, Louisiana health officials started seeing a "substantial" increase in whooping cough cases, part of a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increase in cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late January 2025, physicians inside one Louisiana hospital warned their colleagues that two infants had died in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 13, the state's surgeon general, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/office-of-the-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;Ralph Abraham&lt;/a&gt;, sent a memo to staff &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-02-14/louisiana-department-of-health-officially-ends-all-vaccine-promotion-events" target="_blank"&gt;ending the general promotion of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and community vaccine events.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He sent that email a few hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, won Senate confirmation as the new U.S. health and human services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also that day, Abraham posted a &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" target="_blank"&gt;public memo&lt;/a&gt; on the Louisiana Department of Health's website. In it, he said public health had overstepped with vaccine recommendations, which, he said, are driven by "a one-size-fits-all, collectivist mentality." Abraham has called COVID-19 vaccines "&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1966237494627983445" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;" and has been a &lt;a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/opinion/article_046632f2-b423-4918-afa4-3434e1cc5b8b.html" target="_blank"&gt;vocal supporter&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Four days later, in response to a request from a TV news station in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health confirmed the deaths of two infants from whooping cough for the first time, in an email. WVUE Fox 8 then &lt;a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/02/21/highly-contagious-whooping-cough-cases-rise/" target="_blank"&gt;published the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Louisiana Department of Health sent out no alerts, according to a review of external and internal communications by NPR and KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the next month, two more infants were hospitalized for whooping cough, according to internal health department emails, obtained through a public records request.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, after inquiries from NPR and KFF Health News about the growing number of pertussis cases, the health department put out its first social media communications about the outbreak and offered interviews to other journalists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in May — at least three months after the second infant death — the health department issued what appears to be its first and so far only official &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; to physicians. It put out its &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/whooping-cough" target="_blank"&gt;first press release&lt;/a&gt;, and it then held a press conference about pertussis on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By then, 42 people, three-quarters of whom were not up to date on their whooping cough immunizations, had been hospitalized for whooping cough since the outbreak began, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/05.14.25-Measles-and-Pertussis-Update.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Louisiana Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were babies under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Throughout the summer, cases of pertussis continued to climb in Louisiana. But there were no further public communications from the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR and KFF contacted the department for comment on Sept. 25. A spokeswoman did not answer specific questions about the lack of communications but referred to a Sept. 30 &lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1973028756710109660" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; by the state surgeon general.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the post, Abraham said the department "consistently reported cases of pertussis and provided guidance to help residents stay protected" in 2025. He called the pertussis vaccine "one of the least controversial" and said he recommends it to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The post on X included a year-by-year graphic of pertussis cases that omitted 2024 and 2025. The post also acknowledged for the first time that one of the infant deaths occurred in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A "train wreck" of cases and hospitalizations&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Louisiana should have started warning the public within days or a week of the first infant's death, instead of waiting months, said Stanford's Karan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At minimum, it should be like heavy promotion of, 'Hey, infants are at high risk. They get infected by people who have waning immunity. If you haven't gotten vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you have these symptoms, get tested,'" Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While deaths from a vaccine-preventable illness are tragic, they can also serve as an opportunity to educate the public about the benefits of vaccines and try to save lives, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1781/joshua-m-sharfstein" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Joshua Sharfstein&lt;/a&gt;, a former health secretary for Maryland, and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The risk of pertussis is always there, but when you have two infant deaths it's a really good opportunity to communicate that this is a real threat to the health of children," Sharfstein said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By not acting more quickly, Karan said he believes the department may have set itself up for a worse outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because then what we see is this train wreck thereafter, of like an insanely large outbreak, a lot of hospitalizations," Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The outbreak continued&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 20, Louisiana had counted &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/232491" target="_blank"&gt;387 cases of whooping cough in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The previous &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-03/louisianas-deadly-whooping-cough-outbreak-is-now-its-worst-in-35-years" target="_blank"&gt;35-year high&lt;/a&gt; was 214 cases, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until the Sept. 30 post on X, the Louisiana Department of Health did not appear to put out any public communications about pertussis over the preceding four months, as hospitalizations continued and case levels surpassed the 2013 levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The health department should be responding aggressively and consistently, said &lt;a href="https://www.laaap.org/chapter-information/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Joseph Bocchini&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Where people are updated on a regular basis and reminded of what needs to be done," he said. "Get your vaccines. Moms, if you're pregnant, get vaccinated. And if you have a cough illness, see your doctor."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWNO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He developed a rare allergy to the chemotherapy, and died rapidly. The case still haunts her. “When you have a patient dying of a treatment that you gave, you never forget that,” she said. “It’s very present.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical team figured the tumor plus the allergy led to his death. But Merad couldn’t shake how extreme the allergic reaction was and insisted on an autopsy. Within hours, she had lung tissue. “We did what we call a warm autopsy. I looked at it and, I mean, these lesions,” she recalled, holding her hands up. “The cancer was gone. There were no cancer cells, and it was full of macrophages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sight stunned her. Macrophages, immune cells often called the “gatekeepers” of the immune response, were known to often be immunosuppressive in the context of cancer, dampening the body’s natural ability to fight it. But in this case, Merad thought they must have been connected to a massive inflammatory response that had destroyed the tumor, but also the lung. If she could understand that inflammatory process, she thought, then maybe it could be harnessed for powerful new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I became convinced that, somehow, these macrophages could be extremely potent,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the inception of cancer immunotherapy, most of the field has focused on T cells, the immune system’s specialized killers and its primary tool against tumors. Immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment in the last decade, with Merck’s Keytruda, engineered cell therapies like CAR-T, and other T cell-targeting drugs extending lives and even completely eliminating tumors in some cases. But many patients don’t respond or eventually stop responding to these therapies. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Merad and a growing number of researchers believe macrophages are the key to making immunotherapies work for more people. They are seeing hope from early clinical trial data that macrophage targeted therapies might be able to synergize with T cell therapies and enhance immunotherapy for cancer. Biologists are starting to dive into how these cells may be central to aging, which may lead to new treatments for diseases like dementia and even new ways to help people age better and improve their health span. Companies and academic labs are also experimenting with macrophages to help control inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like lupus.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The number of people using injectable obesity treatments is increasing rapidly, and it is leading to declines in obesity, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The obesity rate dropped to 37% of U.S. adults this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey found that the number of Americans taking drugs like semaglutide (which include the brands Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (under the brands Zepbound and Mounjaro) for weight loss more than doubled over the past year and a half. That's 12.4% of respondents taking the drugs compared with 5.8% in February 2024, when Gallup first measured it. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved in the U.S. market in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;GLP-1s, which act on the brain and the body's hormones to help suppress hunger and slow digestion, were considered a watershed in Americans' long struggle to address obesity and related diseases, which have persistently and stubbornly increased through the decades, through various dietary trends and public health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey is one indication that this may be starting to change, albeit slowly. Since the drugs have come on the market, declines in obesity rates have been higher among those between ages 40 and 64, correlating with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications for that age group. Use of the medications is highest among those ages 50 to 64, for example, and in that cohort, obesity rates dropped 5.0 points to 42.8%. Similarly, the survey found more women take the drugs, with corresponding greater weight loss compared with men too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These drugs have been a game changer for patients with obesity, but access to the drugs is still limited. Access is poised to become a bigger issue, says Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Harvard University obesity specialist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say this correlation happened for those that had great coverage, but it's going to be pulled back," she says, noting that many private insurers — including ones that cover most of her patients — are stopping coverage of GLP-1 medications as of next year. Without coverage, Stanford says, injections will typically cost patients about $500 a month out of pocket. And while drugmakers are working to bring potentially less-expensive pill versions to market, for example, she says it likely still will put the treatments out of reach for many.&lt;/p&gt;

Friends are now sending me articles and clippings about cancer research and the promise of new therapies. If they had actually READ these articles, they would see that clinical trials on humans are far off, or that the type of cancer referred to in the article is different from what my relative has. Why offer hope when there is none? The same thing happened to me when I had cancer 20 years ago. In one instance, I received an article about how to prevent the cancer I already had! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CG2ROG7VONE6ZHDYKVV2DAA7G4"&gt;Please remind your readers that although these items are most often sent with love, they do little to help the individual experiencing the illness and treatment and can cause anger and pain. Doctors, especially oncologists, provide their patients with the best treatments available. It’s best to let them handle it.

Out of a need to do SOMETHING, they will send articles, some of which are inappropriate.

		&lt;p&gt;Winter used to feel like a test of endurance: grey skies, late trains, and that heavy hush that drops at 4pm. This year, something else is happening. From kitchen tables to therapy rooms and group chats, people are swapping grind-for-grit and chasing steadiness over perfection. The question isn’t “How do I get through it?” anymore. It’s “How do I come out stronger?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus doors slide open and a gust of air smelling faintly of rain pushes in. A woman in a navy coat taps her Oyster, eyes half on the platform clock, half on the text from her sister: “How are you holding up?” At the coffee stand, the barista’s radio hums a slow song, and everyone looks softer under the yellow light. You can almost hear the collective exhale as January settles into routine. We’ve all had that moment when the cold nudges your thoughts into a smaller room and you wonder if your spark got left on a brighter day. What if winter wasn’t the villain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nervous system care is the new winter fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase slipping into everyday talk right now is simple: take care of your nervous system. Not fancy, not flashy, just **winter pacing** in a world that loves the sprint. People are noticing that their mood tracks the basics: light, sleep, warmth, and the tone of their days. Instead of punishing workouts and bulletproof routines, the trend is to create an environment your body recognises as safe. Think morning light, quiet inputs, soft starts. It looks like health, but it feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal, 34, works hybrid in Manchester and calls it his “calm plan.” He walks to the corner shop at 8:30am just to catch daylight on his face, then answers emails standing near the window. He keeps a wool jumper on the back of his chair and lines up lo-fi playlists for the 4pm dip. Google Trends shows searches for “light therapy” spiking every January, and TikTok keeps surfacing “somatic drills” with millions of views. Jamal swears it isn’t new-age. “It’s just making my body less jumpy,” he laughs, blowing on tea as the kettle clicks again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this work? Light early in the day nudges your internal clock to stay in rhythm, so energy arrives when you need it and rest lands where it belongs. Warmth, soft sound, and clear edges around work tell your brain, “You’re not in danger,” so it dials down the background alarm. When that hum quiets, emotions get less jagged and choices get kinder. It’s not about hacking biology. It’s about sending steady, repeated “you’re safe” signals, until the winter no longer feels like a fight you’re losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Micro-habits that actually stick when it’s freezing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try the “10-before-10” ritual. It’s a single, precise action: spend ten minutes outside before 10am, eyes off your phone, even if it’s grey. No steps target, no perfect park, no Lycra. Just face the sky, breathe slowly, and feel your jaw unclench. If it’s bucketing down, stand by the brightest window you can find. Build a tiny cue you can’t ignore — keys on the windowsill, hat by the kettle — and treat it like brushing your teeth. Small, automatic, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common mistake: turning a winter reset into an Olympic sport. You draw a 30-step routine and crash by day three, then blame yourself for being human. Go smaller. Two minutes of movement while the toast browns. Three lines of journalling on a sticky note. One call to a friend on your walk home. Let’s be honest: no one really does that every day. Aim for “four days out of seven” and call the wins what they are — **micro-joys** that stack. You’ll notice it on the days you don’t do them. That’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how one therapist framed it to me — think tone, not trophies. Start light, keep it repeatable, and build warmth into the bones of your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Winter isn’t asking you to be stronger. It’s asking you to be steadier. Choose rituals that make your body feel safe, and your mind will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use “first light, first sip”: step into daylight with your first coffee or tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make “two-sentence journal” your rule: one feeling, one next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find **gentle accountability**: a friend, a Slack check-in, or a calendar emoji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a “warm kit”: hat, gloves, hand-warmer by the door for no-excuse minutes outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower noise: one news check at lunch, mute all but three chats till 10am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Connection, meaning, and the soft social reboot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter 2025 isn’t just about you and your morning light. The deeper trend is tiny, dependable togetherness. Micro-gatherings over grand plans. Soup clubs where neighbours rotate one pan a week. Body-doubling Zooms where cameras are half-off and productivity is caught, not forced. A monthly “bring one thing you baked” circle where nobody judges the supermarket brownies. These are small acts with a big echo: they cut through the lonely hum that grows when days are short. If you’re carrying a heavy season, you don’t need another performance. You need a place to stand, with someone next to you, where your phone can stay face down and your shoulders drop two inches. Call it *quiet ambition*: less proving, more belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nervous system care&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Light early, warmth cues, softer starts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Feel calmer and steadier within days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Micro-habits that stick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“10-before-10”, two-sentence journalling, tiny movement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low effort, high return, easy to repeat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Soft social reboot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Micro-gatherings, body-doubling, soup clubs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reduce loneliness and build real resilience&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one thing I can start this week?&lt;/strong&gt;Do “10-before-10” every weekday. Ten minutes of daylight before 10am — outside if possible, window if not. It’s simple and sets your day’s tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work nights — does this still apply?&lt;/strong&gt;Shift the light rule to your wake-up time. Get bright light soon after you rise, keep evenings dim, and anchor one tiny ritual at the same point in your shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I stop doomscrolling first thing?&lt;/strong&gt;Move social apps to the second screen and put a single photo widget by your alarm. Open the front door for a breath before you open a feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I hate group stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;Choose low-key connection: a body-doubling call with one mate, a quiet library hour, or a monthly swap of playlists. Belonging can be quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a replacement for therapy or meds?&lt;/strong&gt;No. These trends support wellbeing but aren’t treatment. If you’re struggling, speak to a professional or your GP and use these as kind add-ons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also called colorectal cancer, the disease occurs when abnormal cells form in the colon or rectum and can spread to other organs if not detected early. Though it has long been considered a condition affecting older adults, doctors are now seeing a worrying increase among younger people, driven by sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits. Data from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (WHO) shows that colon cancer accounted for over 1.9 million new cases and nearly 930,000 deaths worldwide in 2020, underscoring its global health impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the value of prevention, Dr Saurabh Sethi, MD, MPH, a gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, recently shared an informative post on Instagram. He explained that eating foods high in fibre, antioxidants, and probiotics can help reduce inflammation, support gut health, and significantly lower the risk of developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10 everyday foods that quietly protect you from colon cancer, according to a gastroenterologist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6617?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a diet high in whole grains and dietary fibre can significantly lower the risk of colon cancer. Researchers found that individuals who regularly consumed fibre-rich foods such as oats, barley, beans, and lentils had improved digestion, reduced inflammation in the colon, and a healthier gut microbiome, all of which contribute to cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-020-00556-6?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in the Nutrition Journal (BioMed Central)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that regular intake of whole grains was linked to an 11% reduction in colon cancer risk, highlighting how a fibre-rich diet supports colon health by promoting the removal of toxins and maintaining regular bowel movements. These findings reinforce the importance of choosing unprocessed, plant-based foods to quietly protect the colon over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans, lentils, and other legumes are rich in dietary fibre, which supports healthy digestion and helps sweep out toxins from the intestines. Fibre reduces the time spent in the colon, lowering the chances of cell damage or inflammation that can lead to cancer. These foods are also high in plant-based proteins and resistant starch, which nourish beneficial gut bacteria. When gut microbes ferment these starches, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broccoli and cruciferous vegetables&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts are part of the cruciferous vegetable family, famous for their detoxifying effects. They contain sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, compounds that help neutralise harmful carcinogens and support liver function. Studies suggest that people who regularly consume cruciferous vegetables may have a lower risk of colorectal cancer due to their ability to regulate inflammation and protect DNA from oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are packed with antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and vitamin C. These compounds help fight oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the colon lining. Berries also support healthy cell regeneration and can inhibit the growth of cancerous cells. Adding a small bowl of mixed berries to your breakfast or smoothie is an easy way to harness their benefits daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oats, barley, and quinoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains like oats, barley, and quinoa are excellent sources of soluble fibre and beta-glucans, which improve gut health and promote regular bowel movements. A high-fibre diet can dilute potential carcinogens in the digestive tract and support beneficial bacteria. These grains also help maintain a healthy weight and regulate blood sugar, both important factors for reducing cancer risk. Swapping refined grains with whole ones can make a long-term difference in digestive and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, lettuce, and other leafy greens provide chlorophyll, folate, and carotenoids, compounds that help repair DNA and protect cells from damage. Folate, in particular, supports healthy cell division and reduces the risk of mutations that can lead to cancer. Including a variety of greens in your meals not only adds fibre but also boosts your intake of vitamins A, C, and K, which enhance immunity and detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Garlic&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic is rich in sulphur-containing compounds such as allicin, which have been linked to reduced cancer risk. These compounds can help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, enhance immune function, and slow the spread of abnormal cells. Regular consumption of fresh garlic, whether raw, roasted, or added to meals, supports both digestive and cardiovascular health while providing anti-inflammatory protection to the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Onions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like garlic, onions belong to the Allium family and contain flavonoids and organosulphur compounds that have protective effects against colon cancer. They help detoxify the body and reduce inflammation in the intestinal lining. Onions also promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut, supporting a healthy microbiome, an important factor in preventing colon and other digestive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tomatoes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are abundant in lycopene, a red pigment and potent antioxidant that may lower cancer risk by protecting cells from oxidative stress. Cooking tomatoes enhances lycopene absorption, making tomato sauces, soups, and curries excellent additions to your diet. Alongside lycopene, tomatoes contain vitamin C and potassium, which contribute to overall digestive and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yoghurt and fermented foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic-rich foods such as yoghurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut contain beneficial bacteria that promote gut balance. A healthy microbiome strengthens the intestinal barrier, reduces inflammation, and improves immune response. Research has shown that regular intake of probiotics can lower the risk of colon cancer by suppressing the growth of harmful bacteria and supporting nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are nutrient-dense foods high in fibre, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. These nutrients help regulate inflammation, lower cholesterol levels, and protect colon cells from oxidative damage. Nuts and seeds also promote satiety and stable blood sugar, both essential for maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing cancer risk. A handful of mixed nuts or a spoon of ground flaxseed can be an easy, powerful addition to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi’s advice serves as a timely reminder that small, consistent dietary choices can have a powerful impact on long-term health. While medical screenings and lifestyle habits are essential, a diet rich in fibre, antioxidants, and probiotics provides the foundation for colon protection. Making these foods a regular part of your meals can help strengthen your digestive system, lower inflammation, and reduce the risk of colon cancer, quietly, one bite at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Osteoporosis, or the "silent bone disease," thins bones slowly and makes them more susceptible to breakage. Since it does so without overt early signs, most people find out about the condition only after a fracture has been sustained. There are however tell-tale signs our body provides—particularly in our hands, legs, and teeth—that point towards hidden bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I think that awareness of these signs is important. Early detection of osteoporosis can be treated well so it does not lead to disability and enhances quality of life. Let us examine six significant signs you should not overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency: Doctor explains causes,  symptoms and prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Repeated fracture of wrist or hand&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrist and small bones of the hand are often the first sites where osteoporosis reveals itself. A minor fall, something as simple as trying to catch yourself when tripping, can cause a fracture if bones have lost density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it happens: The bones in the forearm (radius and ulna) and the small carpal bones are vulnerable when weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Telltale sign: If you break a bone from a low-impact accident—something that wouldn't usually fracture a healthy bone—it could be an early warning sign of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blowing off repeated fractures to the hand or wrist is risky, as they indicate systemic bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Grip weakening and stiffness of hands&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakening grip is more than a reflection of age. Studies indicate that grip strength has a high correlation with overall bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Why it occurs: Weakened muscle support and poor bones in the hand limit functional strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Warning indicator: Inability to open jars, lift grocery bags, or grasp objects firmly can indicate hidden osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weakened grip should not only be addressed with hand exercises but also with a bone health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Hip and leg pain or sudden fractures&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hip is among the most frequent and perilous locations of osteoporotic fractures. Likewise, shin bone or thigh bone fractures following minor injuries are not typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Why it occurs: Osteoporosis diminishes bone density in load-bearing bones like the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and hip joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning signal: Recurring leg pain without obvious injury, or a fracture after a simple slip, must be evaluated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hip fractures, specifically, can seriously limit mobility and independence, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Tapering height and bent legs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis tends to affect the spine but also shows changes in the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it occurs: Progressive micro-fractures in the vertebrae lead to spinal compression. This affects the body's equilibrium and results in abnormal stress on the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning sign: Clear shortening of stature, bent legs, or bowed legs should not be attributed to mere "old age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes signal advanced bone thinning and structural compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Receding gums and loose teeth&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jawbone is also impacted by osteoporosis. Dental health thus offers early indications of bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it occurs: Bone loss in the jaw diminishes support for gums and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning sign: Receding gums, loose teeth, or ill-fitting dentures can all be attributed to poor bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists usually detect early indicators of osteoporosis during regular dental appointments. Oral health should therefore never be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Brittle toenails and foot problems&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not as often talked about, the feet can also be an indicator of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Why it occurs: Weakened bone in the little bones of the feet puts one at risk for stress fractures. Weak connective tissues and low mineral content can also impair nail strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Sign of warning: Brittle toenails, painful feet with frequent use, or stress fractures with short-distance walking can be a sign of underlying bone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are usually ignored but may be crucial indicators of systemic bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these symptoms are significant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these signs—delicate hands, weakened grip, hip or leg fracture, change in posture, dental problem, brittle feet—looks insignificant individually. Collectively, however, they paint a distinct picture of potential osteoporosis. Catching them early provides room for early medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you identify with these signs, then what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you observe any of the aforementioned signs, you are encouraged to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. Seek the advice of a doctor: Orthopaedic or endocrinology experts are able to advise on assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Obtain a DEXA scan: This checks bone mineral density and verifies diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Monitor nutrition levels: Calcium and vitamin D deficiency are reversible causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Make bone-friendly lifestyle changes: Weight-bearing exercise, cessation of smoking, reduction of alcohol use, and a healthy diet slow disease progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Medical therapy may be considered: Based on severity, medications like bisphosphonates, denosumab, or hormone therapy can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overlooking common wrist fractures, grip weakness, hip or leg pains, decreasing height, receding gums, or brittle toenails can be expensive. By observing these warning signs and receiving early medical intervention, you can take control of your bone health before permanent damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As doctors, our goal is not only to treat broken bones but also to empower patients to recognize early symptoms and prevent fractures altogether.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemists from the University of Warwick and Monash University have discovered a promising new antibiotic that shows activity against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and VRE&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the world's most urgent health challenges, with the WHO's &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; showing there are 'too few antibacterials in the pipeline." Most of the 'low-hanging fruit' has already been found, and the limited commercial incentives deter investment in antibiotic discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12501" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the Monash Warwick Alliance Combating Emerging Superbug Threats Initiative have discovered a promising new antibiotic—pre-methylenomycin C lactone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered antibiotic was "hiding in plain sight"—as an intermediate chemical in the natural process that produces the well-known antibiotic methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-lead author of the study, Professor Greg Challis, in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, and Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University says, "Methylenomycin A was originally discovered 50 years ago and while it has been synthesized several times, no-one appears to have tested the synthetic intermediates for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/antimicrobial+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antimicrobial activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By deleting biosynthetic genes, we discovered two previously unknown biosynthetic intermediates, both of which are much more potent antibiotics than methylenomycin A itself."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;When tested for antimicrobial activity, one of the intermediates, pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was shown to be over 100 times more active against diverse Gram-positive bacteria than the original antibiotic methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it was shown to be effective against S. aureus and E. faecium, the bacterial species behind Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-lead author Dr. Lona Alkhalaf, Assistant Professor, University of Warwick adds, "Remarkably, the bacterium that makes methylenomycin A and pre-methylenomycin C lactone—Streptomyces coelicolor—is a model antibiotic-producing species that's been studied extensively since the 1950s. Finding a new antibiotic in such a familiar organism was a real surprise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It looks like S. coelicolor originally evolved to produce a powerful antibiotic (pre-methylenomycin C lactone), but over time has changed it into methylenomycin A—a much weaker antibiotic that may play a different role in the bacterium's biology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers could not detect any emergence of resistance to pre-methylenomycin C lactone in Enterococcus bacteria under conditions where vancomycin resistance is observed. Vancomycin is a "last line" treatment for Enterococcus infection, so this finding is especially promising for VRE, a WHO High Priority Pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Challis continues, "This discovery suggests a new paradigm for antibiotic discovery. By identifying and testing intermediates in the pathways to diverse natural compounds, we may find potent new antibiotics with more resilience to resistance that will aid us in the fight against AMR."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The next step in the development of the antibiotic will be pre-clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a coordinated publication earlier this year in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.5c01179?ref=PDF" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Organic Chemistry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Monash, collaborating with the Warwick team, reported a scalable synthesis of pre-methylenomycin C lactone, paving the way for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor David Lupton, School of Chemistry, Monash University, who led the synthesis work, says, "This synthetic route should enable the creation of diverse analogs that can be used to probe the structure−activity relationship and mechanism of action for pre-methylenomycin C lactone. The Center to Impact AMR at Monash gives us a great platform to take this promising antimicrobial forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its simple structure, potent activity, difficult to resist profile, and scalable synthesis, pre-methylenomycin C lactone represents a promising new candidate that could potentially help to save some of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" target="_blank"&gt;1.1 million&lt;/a&gt; people who are the victims of AMR every year.&lt;/p&gt;

His face received full-thickness burns after a speeding drunk driver hit him while he was out cycling with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said he was “lucky to survive” the crash which also damaged his back and pelvis and caused him to break several ribs on one side of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While recovering, he was referred to reconstructive prosthetics, which has opened the Bristol 3D medical centre, the first of its kind in the UK to have 3D scanning, design and printing in a single NHS location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards, from Devon, said surgeons tried to save his eye but “they were worried any infection could spread from my eye down the optic nerve to the brain so the eye was removed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The decision was then made to go for free flap, taking tissue with blood arteries and veins and plumbing it into my neck, the flap completely covering the side of my face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He called the process of getting a 3D-printed face “not the most pleasant”. He added: “In the early days of my recovery, I felt very vulnerable, and would not expose myself to social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It took me a long time to feel comfortable about my image, how I thought people looked at me and what they thought of me – but I have come a long way in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Describing the incident that nearly cost him his life, which took place in July 2021, he said: “It was a lovely sunny day, and not long into the ride we were going up a hill on a B road, and this guy comes up behind us at speed, and over the drunk drive limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He was on his phone, racing up behind us and we were all in line. He wanted to swerve around us, but there was a car coming the other way, so it was either smash into the car or smash into us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards said his two friends were hit by the car and thrown clear of it but he became trapped under the vehicle. “[I] was rolled along, with the engine and exhaust burning through one side of my body and the other side being crushed by the car.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said despite his initial “sceptical” feelings towards his treatment, he was happy he had followed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’m glad I’ve followed this treatment process as it has got me to where I am today. I have always said no matter what treatment is offered, if I think there’s a benefit and the risks aren’t too high, I will try anything and have a go and that’s still the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Amy Davey, the senior reconstructive scientist at North Bristol NHS trust, said: “Surface scanning patients for prosthetics means that patients can be scanned while moving, and this technology can use that movement to aid the prostheses to accommodate movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The 3D printers used involve advanced plastic resins whose properties allow direct application to the skin, with materials that are safe against the skin for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man who struck Richards was sentenced to three years and banned from driving for seven years but it is believed he was released after one and a half years for good behaviour and for pleading guilty from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards said: “As you can imagine, I am not best pleased with his reduced sentence as I very nearly lost my life and have to live with all the pain from my injuries on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPdVp4UFN1X3E4bmFYa0FDQXhfYWFkbEphYVBvQjRwOVh3S1dNS1laRmVtRXdJYUc3aXdhbkZsYWpJNk1uRm5DTkh4V1VJYTVoQkpnWlN3WExIOG90V0VXSjMwRVNybnJyN3RoM1pPdE5ROEZ4QXN5NWNrQ2RBdXZhVmJiRHFSUmNta0dReFlhbjdDUVJUdkFfMGUzQXM5SVpwSS1mY1FkdlQxN1pjRXJhc2JvZGxMaGJFZUF1SVdxSzRpN24zaVpldnBUT2t1cHIt</guid></item><item><title>健康图片：研究显示，去艺术画廊可以改善健康状况-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/28/picture-of-health-going-to-art-galleries-can-improve-wellbeing-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Enjoying original works of art in a gallery can relieve stress, reduce the risk of heart disease and boost your immune system, according to the first study of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers measured the physiological responses of participants while viewing masterpieces by world-renowned artists including Manet, Van Gogh and Gauguin in a gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that art positively influences the immune, hormone and nervous systems all at once – something never previously recorded. The findings suggest that seeing original art not only moves people emotionally, but also calms the body and promotes health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, led by King’s College London, involved 50 people aged between 18 and 40 in the UK. Half viewed original artwork at the Courtauld Gallery in London, while the other half looked at copies of the same paintings in a non-gallery environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The two groups wore sensors that continually measured their heart rates and skin temperature during the 20-minute session, with saliva samples also taken before and after viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From these samples, researchers found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol fell by an average of 22% among those viewing original art, compared with just 8% looking at reproductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) linked to stress and a number of chronic diseases fell by 30% and 28% respectively among those in the gallery, with no changes in the other group. This suggests art has a potential calming effect on the body’s inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Tony Woods, a researcher at King’s College London, said: “The research clearly shows the stress-reducing properties of viewing original art and its ability to simultaneously excite, engage and arouse us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Stress hormones and inflammatory markers like cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are linked to a wide range of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fact that viewing original art lowered these markers suggests that cultural experiences may play a real role in protecting both mind and body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also found that art engages the immune system, the nervous system and the endocrine system, which is responsible for releasing hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers detected signs of excitement among those viewing art in the gallery, including a dip in skin temperature, overall higher heart rates and a variation in heartbeat patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“From a scientific perspective, the most exciting outtake is that art had a positive impact on three different body systems – the immune, endocrine and autonomic systems – at the same time,” Woods said. “This is a unique finding and something we were genuinely surprised to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In short, our unique and original study provides compelling evidence that viewing art in a gallery is good for you and helps to further our understanding of its fundamental benefits.

That's about 1,500 steps in a row, which gives your heart a good workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people aim for 10,000 steps a day, but that number came from a Japanese pedometer advertisement - not science. Still, experts agree more steps are generally better for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study looked at 33,560 adults aged 40–79 in the UK who walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They were grouped by how long their walks were (measured with a step-counter over a week):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;less than 5 minutes (43%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;5 to 10 minutes (33.5%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;10 to 15 minutes (15.5%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;15 minutes or more (8%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers, from the University of Sydney and the Universidad Europea in Spain, tracked their health over eight years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People who walked in longer stretches had a lower risk of heart problems than those who walked in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even among the least active - those walking under 5,000 steps a day - longer walks made a big difference. Their risk of heart disease and death dropped significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Whether that's because they were fitter to begin with isn't fully clear from the study, but the researchers did try to control for this by taking into account factors like whether the person smoked, was obese or had high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Focus on how you walk – not just how much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers say how you walk matters - not just how much. Walking for longer at a time, even if you don't walk much overall, appears to help your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Simple changes, like setting aside time for a longer walk, could make a big difference, they suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Co-lead researcher Prof Emmanuel Stamatakis said: "We tend to place all the emphasis on the number of steps or the total amount of walking but neglect the crucial role of patterns, for example 'how' walking is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This study shows that even people who are very physically inactive can maximise their heart health benefit by tweaking their walking patterns to walk for longer at a time, ideally for at least 10-15 minutes, when possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said while the study shows a link between walking and better heart health, it doesn't prove that walking directly causes the improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;The NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, like brisk walking, ideally spread out evenly across the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Older adults over 65 should &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-older-adults/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;try to move every day&lt;/a&gt;, even if it's just light activity around the house, the advice says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Emily McGrath, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Exercise helps everyone live a happier and healthier life. If you have heart and circulatory disease, it can help you manage your condition and make you feel better overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"You may find it hard to be more active at first, but as time goes on it'll get easier as your body gets used to the activity.

After two years of treatment, participants maintained stronger cognitive performance than typical Alzheimer’s patients and showed reduced levels of tau protein, a key disease biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The noninvasive therapy, known as GENUS, works by synchronizing brain activity to a 40Hz gamma rhythm through light and sound. While early-onset patients saw fewer benefits, researchers say the results highlight the potential for a safe, at-home intervention to delay Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Late-onset Alzheimer’s participants maintained higher cognitive scores and improved sleep patterns over two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Two participants showed significant decreases in plasma tau levels, linked to Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Noninvasive:&lt;/strong&gt; The GENUS 40Hz light-and-sound therapy was well tolerated and feasible for daily home use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new research paper documents the outcomes of five volunteers who continued to receive 40Hz light and sound stimulation for around two years after participating in an MIT early-stage clinical study of the potential Alzheimer’s disease therapy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that for the three participants with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, several measures of cognition remained significantly higher than comparable Alzheimer’s patients in national databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the two late-onset volunteers who donated plasma samples, levels of Alzheimer’s biomarker tau proteins were significantly decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three volunteers who experienced these benefits were all female. The two other participants, each of whom were males with early-onset forms of the disease, did not exhibit significant benefits after two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset, while small, represents the longest-term test so far of the safe, non-invasive treatment method (called GENUS, for gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli), which is also being evaluated in a nationwide clinical trial run by MIT-spinoff company Cognito Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This pilot study assessed the long-term effects of daily 40Hz multimodal GENUS in patients with mild AD,” the authors wrote in&lt;em&gt; Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: T&lt;/em&gt;he &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that daily 40Hz audiovisual stimulation over 2 years is safe, feasible, and may slow cognitive decline and biomarker progression, especially in late-onset AD patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Chan, a former research scientist in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, is the study’s lead and co-corresponding author. Picower Professor Li-Huei Tsai, director of The Picower Institute and the Aging Brain Initiative at MIT, is the study’s senior and co-corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An “open label” extension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, MIT enrolled 15 volunteers with mild Alzheimer’s disease in an early-stage trial to evaluate whether an hour a day of 40Hz light and sound stimulation, delivered via an LED panel and speaker in their homes, could deliver clinically meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies in mice had shown that the sensory stimulation increases the power and synchrony of 40Hz gamma frequency brain waves, preserves neurons and their network connections, reduces Alzheimer’s proteins such as amyloid and tau, and sustains learning and memory. Several independent groups have also made similar findings over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT’s trial, though cut short by the Covid-19 pandemic, found significant benefits after three months. The new study examines outcomes among five volunteers who continued to use their stimulation devices on an “open label” basis for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These volunteers came back to MIT for a series of tests 30 months after their initial enrollment. Because four participants started the original trial as controls (meaning they initially did not receive 40Hz stimulation), their open label usage was six to 9 months shorter than the 30-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testing at 0, 3 and 30 months of enrollment included measurements of their brain wave response to the stimulation, MRI scans of brain volume, measures of sleep quality and a series of five standard cognitive and behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two participants gave blood samples. For comparison to untreated controls, the researchers combed through three national databases of Alzheimer’s patients, matching thousands of them on criteria such as age, gender, initial cognitive scores, and retests at similar timepoints across a 30-month span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcomes and outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three female late-onset Alzheimer’s volunteers showed improvement or slower decline on most of the cognitive tests, including significantly positive differences compared to controls on three of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These volunteers also showed increased brain-wave responsiveness to the stimulation at 30 months and showed improvement in measures of circadian rhythms. In the two late-onset volunteers who gave blood samples, there were significant declines in phosphorylated tau (47 percent for one and 19.4 percent for the other) on a test recently approved by the FDA as the first plasma biomarker for diagnosing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most compelling findings from this study was the significant reduction of plasma pTau217, a biomarker strongly correlated with AD pathology, in the two late-onset patients in whom follow-up blood samples were available,” the authors wrote in the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that GENUS could have direct biological impacts on Alzheimer’s pathology, warranting further mechanistic exploration in larger randomized trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the initial trial results showed preservation of brain volume at 3 months among those who received 40Hz stimulation, that was not significant at the 30-month timepoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the two male early-onset volunteers did not show significant improvements on cognitive test scores. Notably, the early onset patients showed significantly reduced brain-wave responsiveness to the stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the sample is small, the authors hypothesize that the difference between the two sets of patients is likely attributable to the difference in disease onset rather than the difference in gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GENUS may be less effective in early onset Alzheimer’s disease patients, potentially owing to broad pathological differences from late-onset Alzheimer’s disease that could contribute to differential responses,” the authors wrote. “Future research should explore predictors of treatment response, such as genetic and pathological markers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the research team is studying whether GENUS may have a preventative effect when applied before disease onset. The new trial is recruiting participants aged 55+ with normal memory who have or had a close family member with Alzheimer’s disease, including early-onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Chan and Tsai, the paper’s other authors are Gabrielle de Weck, Brennan L.

Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess neural entrainment; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured brain volumes; actigraphy monitored activity patterns; neuropsychological tests evaluated cognition; and S-PLEX assay measured plasma pTau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70792-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adverse events occurred over the study period. Three female patients with late-onset AD (LOAD) retained strong EEG entrainment and showed less decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Functional Assessment Scale (FAS) scores compared to matched controls from National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS). Plasma samples were available for only two of five participants – both with LOAD – and both showed pTau217 reductions of 47% and 19%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70792-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that long-term 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation is safe, feasible, and may offer cognitive and biomarker benefits in some individuals with mild AD, supporting further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70792-sec-0050-title"&gt;CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; (NCT04055376).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:55:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5heThNTlREM3R0TEo0RnhlM0pIN2tUTmdqRHBSWUNpWVA0SnByRElDdVhhbkpOX20tVDZIQ3k4RmJQMW8yV05zcGFLM0xxUzZSelZrdVlheVkzSkxyQ0loNzI0eXlCVWd4WWdZelEwMFR2Tm5qQ2ZYbVVxRQ</guid></item><item><title>距离拉斯维加斯160英里的小城镇爆发123起麻疹疫情- KLAS 8 News Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPVHRrVkVydDNzWWs0QU85a3I1MTdWZmhwTS12RVdzM0tFZVNXNUJPb21ETDVDcWhoWjVlQ1ZQalRmVEszNHNOSW5iR0ZndlJhQ01JMU5Scm03ajU2aXZNaTRHOVN2S2NIMXlCU0MzLUdBa3Qxa3JZTG1aZ1otOUFvSzM2dlF2TjN1em9EMDhrbEM3b3dLcTdfQWtRdGrSAaIBQVVfeXFMTnJpTVRlSGoxaGdJMWhmR1QwVGNqdDhVYkFTR2RUdEVxbkxUejNRWHlKOVdIeU5MNzZUbmxwVlJsdFF6dXFsZzBuNXdfWlZUbmk0N3E2b0lYSjRvY3ZVZ01VOFJpWDhicm5leWN1NUpCZDllbjRVY0RUSHIxT29UZ1U4ZDEwT3ZwcVl6d0J6d1FGTm5Qc0NoczdFOTBFWkMxcXZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="y0K44d EA71Tc" id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</description><author>KLAS 8 News Now</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:53:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPVHRrVkVydDNzWWs0QU85a3I1MTdWZmhwTS12RVdzM0tFZVNXNUJPb21ETDVDcWhoWjVlQ1ZQalRmVEszNHNOSW5iR0ZndlJhQ01JMU5Scm03ajU2aXZNaTRHOVN2S2NIMXlCU0MzLUdBa3Qxa3JZTG1aZ1otOUFvSzM2dlF2TjN1em9EMDhrbEM3b3dLcTdfQWtRdGrSAaIBQVVfeXFMTnJpTVRlSGoxaGdJMWhmR1QwVGNqdDhVYkFTR2RUdEVxbkxUejNRWHlKOVdIeU5MNzZUbmxwVlJsdFF6dXFsZzBuNXdfWlZUbmk0N3E2b0lYSjRvY3ZVZ01VOFJpWDhicm5leWN1NUpCZDllbjRVY0RUSHIxT29UZ1U4ZDEwT3ZwcVl6d0J6d1FGTm5Qc0NoczdFOTBFWkMxcXZR</guid></item><item><title>为什么蜜蜂会推翻它们的蜂后- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-10-honey-bees-queen.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the plot of a medieval historical drama: A once-powerful monarch, weakened by illness, is overthrown by her previously loyal subjects. But in honey bee colonies, such high-stakes coups aren't just fantasy—they're a common occurrence that comes with both risk and reward for bee colonies and the food systems that depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Known as supersedure, the process occurs when the tens of thousands of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/worker+bees/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;worker bees&lt;/a&gt; in a colony sense their &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/queen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt; is no longer laying enough eggs and coordinate to replace her with a new, healthier queen. While this survival strategy helps wild colonies adapt, it can spell trouble for managed hives, leading to gaps in egg-laying, weaker colony populations and ultimately less pollinating and honey production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at the University of British Columbia have made an important discovery that illuminates why these violent revolts occur and how they're coordinated with such remarkable synchronicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published recently in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2518975122" target="_blank"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the research team found that common viral infections shrink a queen's ovaries, reducing both her egg-laying capacity and her production of methyl oleate, a pheromone that normally keeps workers loyal. When methyl oleate levels drop, workers will "smell" the queen's weakness and begin preparing her successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A healthy queen can lay as many as 850 to 3,200 eggs per day, which is more than her whole body weight," said senior author Dr. Leonard Foster, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UBC's Faculty of Medicine and Michael Smith Laboratories. "But in our experiments, virus-infected queens laid fewer eggs and produced less methyl oleate. That pheromone reduction seems to be the signal to workers that a queen is no longer fit to continue."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bees pollinate about one-third of the world's crops, making them essential to healthy food systems, food security and the health of people and communities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beekeepers have been reporting problems with queen failure and premature supersedure for many years, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01603-y" target="_blank"&gt;recent surveys&lt;/a&gt; identifying "poor queens" as the most frequently reported cause of overwintering losses.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The research highlights how &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; are a driving factor behind these challenges, disrupting the delicate balance of chemical signals that maintain order in a hive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the findings also point to a practical way for beekeepers to intervene and manage supersedure. In proof-of-concept field trials, colonies given synthetic pheromone blends that included methyl oleate were much less likely to rear new queens compared to colonies that received blends without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That could be a big deal for beekeepers," said Dr. Foster. "Supersedure can be disruptive and costly, but supplementing colonies with methyl oleate could help stabilize hives during periods when continuous productivity is most important."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings open the door to new management strategies for commercial beekeepers dealing with viral outbreaks, especially during periods of peak pollination or honey production to prevent untimely queen loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research really emphasizes how virus infections in queens can be a major problem for beekeepers," said first author Dr. Alison McAfee, a research associate at UBC's Michael Smith Laboratories and North Carolina State University. "Previous studies showed that failing queens were heavily infected with viruses, and now we know that those infections can lead to supersedure, which is risky for the colony and expensive for beekeepers to manage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also highlights the role of varroa mites—parasitic pests that can spread the viruses linked to queen failure—underscoring the importance of keeping colonies healthy and parasite-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queen infections are so far an underappreciated problem, said Dr. McAfee, who hopes that this research will change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Keeping the queen healthy is one more reason why it is so critical to think ahead and keep varroa levels under control," Dr. McAfee added. "There is currently no treatment for viruses in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/honey+bee+colonies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;honey bee colonies&lt;/a&gt;, but now that we better understand their impact, we can change the way we manage varroa to give the queen a better chance."&lt;/p&gt;

The study was published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4cb08" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a97c92" class="body-graf"&gt;An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-722564" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group — 42.9% of participants — fell into the under-five-minute category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ec362" class="body-graf"&gt;After about 9½ years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6637b5" class="body-graf"&gt;People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2466a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations “doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23f08b" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a clear dose response,” del Pozo Cruz said. “The longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093367" class="body-graf"&gt;The decision to study people’s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/daily-steps-to-lower-risk-of-death-rcna98754" target="_blank"&gt;total number of steps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/workout-exercise-commitment-personality-study-rcna217288" target="_blank"&gt;intensity of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, was intentional, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13fed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,” del Pozo Cruz said. “Everyone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-49b86f" class="body-heading"&gt;Forget ‘exercise snacks’ and 10,000 steps a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eebd68" class="body-graf"&gt;The notion that adults should strive for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/how-many-steps-day-should-you-take-study-finds-7-n1278853" target="_blank"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fba993" class="body-graf"&gt;Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode — changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn’t see as strong health gains, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f84d52" class="body-graf"&gt;“You need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that’s where the health benefits come from,” Riechman said. “The one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c6728" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;mixed research&lt;/a&gt; on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be “suboptimally active.” All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-483b36" class="body-graf"&gt;The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f92be6" class="body-graf"&gt;“You have big returns from zero to something,” Riechman said. “Then you keep getting benefits, but they’re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you’re not accumulating too many more benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a5060" class="body-graf"&gt;The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/exercise-snacks-short-activity-bursts-heart-health-muscle-strength-rcna236192" target="_blank"&gt;“exercise snacks,”&lt;/a&gt; or spurts of physical activity lasting less than &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/lower-blood-pressure-5-minute-exercise-rcna178928" target="_blank"&gt;five minutes&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/09/26/bjsports-2025-110027" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz’s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c5fd0" class="body-graf"&gt;“Every step counts,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/walking/every-step-counts" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association, &lt;/a&gt;a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f8e74" class="body-graf"&gt;“Getting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there’s definitely a benefit,” he said. “To me, you’re just not optimizing the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e38670" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Never too late’ to start walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b4b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dadf32" class="body-graf"&gt;Another research constraint is that participants’ walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people’s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study’s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn’t involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d8adb" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the study’s biggest strengths, she said, is participants’ average age: 62. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/superaging-memory-social-aging-northwestern-university-study-over-80-rcna222908" target="_blank"&gt;a time of life&lt;/a&gt; when people may assume they’re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2be093" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can start [walking] at any age; it’s not too late,” Swain said. “The physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-20f8d7" class="body-graf"&gt;Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it’s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-61ee15" class="body-graf"&gt;“Unfortunately, it’s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven’t done it for so long,” said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. “There has to be motivation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab1974" class="body-graf"&gt;With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-330ea1" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Walking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,” she said. “It’s a good form of exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:06:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOUFBuQ0Y1S1FfbV8xTE9MTFY4OHBtUm5ldWNDRmkxdVlmaVVwbkpLT2NnNGYtcDVGb0k0cXdfWXlERmgtNW9PX3Bxc0tsb1RXZTRrazlSRmh2NDg3cGsyYzQ3bl9neE8yV2RMMEl2ODNxUEd4c2lZNWpaZ292aWJsd3daZ1V5WjZYR2pIcjFOV2V2UlBpdHBaUkJFcjVpcDNfckRld2RB0gFWQVVfeXFMTng2QUtfR1BGY2NhdW81dHlUUXRVbGFrRDBwTlhFend4ZVNJUVpHSllIeW5UaTRFY1NhMXJvVlpaX1NsWGlFdENrQTI2SE9wcGt1Qldfb0E</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹疫情加剧；加拿大的消除地位受到威胁- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-grows-canada-s-elimination-status-threatened</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Upstate South Carolina measles outbreak has grown by 2 more cases, raising the state &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/friday-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-25-total-2025-22-related-upstate-outbreak"&gt;&lt;u&gt;total to 25.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said both infections were linked to close contacts of known cases, who had been under quarantine at home following exposures at two schools with a high percentage of unvaccinated students.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the state’s 25 cases, 22 have occurred as part of the Upstate outbreak.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York’s Rockland County has reported its second measles case in the past 3 months. The cases are notable as Rockland County was the site of a large 2018-19 measles outbreak and is home to a significant unvaccinated population.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new case is not connected to the previous measles case in August,&lt;a href="https://www.rocklandcountyny.gov/Home/Components/News/News/969/746?widgetId=3605"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;county health officials said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The new patient reported a rash shortly after returning from an international trip last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada sees more than 5,000 measles cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks 1 year of continuous measles transmission in Canada, a cycle of virus activity that threatens the country's elimination status.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has had more than&lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 5,100 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since fall 2024, more than double the number recorded in the past 25 years combined. The country eliminated measles in 1998, but that status is now in jeopardy as elimination status requires an absence of local virus transmission for at least 12 months.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/health/measles-elimination-canada-us-who"&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to CNN,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Pan American Health Organization will assess the elimination status of several North American countries at an annual meeting next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 90% of the cases reported in Canada in the last year have been in unvaccinated residents, and all but 157 cases have been associated with the outbreak that began in October 2024 in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel says another child has died of measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-871616"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finally today, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jerusalem Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that an eighth child has died from measles in an ongoing nationwide outbreak in Israel.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was a 2-year-old girl.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of bisphenol A can lead to long-term health effects. When researchers studied adult rats exposed in the fetal stage, they found that females had developed a more masculine and males a more feminine gene expression pattern. This led to females progressing towards a cancer-like state, while males progressed towards metabolic syndrome, which can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Bisphenol A is a synthetic chemical with estrogen-like properties that is commonly used in food packaging materials. The substance is banned in many products, but is still present in some packaging. Levels of bisphenol A in people's bodies are often above levels considered safe, with previous research showing that the substance can cause adverse health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Females masculinized and males feminized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01119-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers investigated how bisphenol A affects the body during the fetal stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were given drinking water containing bisphenol A. Two doses of bisphenol A were studied, one corresponding to the daily human exposure (0.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day) and a higher dose considered safe in 2015 (50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day). The researchers then analyzed gene expression in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; and biological markers in the blood of the adult offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We saw lasting effects in the adult rat," says Thomas Lind, the study's first author. "Even very low doses changed how the genes were expressed. Females were masculinized and males were feminized. Both sexes experienced metabolic changes—females progressed towards a cancer-like state while males showed signs of progression towards &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Strengthens the link between bisphenol A and PCOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also saw an impact on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The activity of some &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, the T cells, increased in males but decreased in females. This finding confirms what previous studies have shown, namely that these immune cells are involved in changes caused by bisphenol A exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the blood markers showed several sex-specific changes. In males, a disturbed lipid profile was observed, with signs of increased metabolism and thyroid-related hyperactivity. In females, there were reduced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glucose+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;, elevated insulin levels and signs of increased testosterone activity, a pattern reminiscent of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results also corroborate previous human studies, where women with the hormone disorder PCOS have exhibited higher levels of bisphenol A in the blood, which correlates with an increased influence of male sex hormones. This reinforces the findings of other studies linking bisphenol A exposure to declining fertility in women," says Lind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study confirms need for stricter regulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that reducing the use of bisphenol A in food packaging could help prevent health risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study shows that even very small amounts of bisphenol A can affect health later in life. Although the results are based on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/experimental+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;experimental data&lt;/a&gt;, they support the European Food Safety Authority's decision to significantly lower the tolerable daily intake of the substance by 20,000 times to 0.2 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;Influencers are breathlessly declaring that estrogen during perimenopause has been proved to dramatically reduce the risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, of course, the reality is more complex. Here’s what we actually know. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new retrospective study looked at more than 120 million patient records and the impact of estrogen therapy when started during perimenopause — or the roughly 10-year period before the final menstrual period — compared with that of estrogen therapy after menopause and no estrogen therapy. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;The study found that perimenopausal people who had used estrogen for at least 10 years prior to menopause had an approximately 60 percent decreased risk of developing breast cancer, heart attack and stroke compared with the two other groups. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Pope spearheaded the study; she is a Menopause Society-certified practitioner, the chief of female sexual medicine at the Urology Institute at the Cleveland Medical Center and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Case Western University. For her, the study was a way to start to fill in gaps in knowledge about hormone therapy in perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pope and her student Ify Chidi, the study’s lead author, looked at diagnostic codes, procedure codes and prescription data taken from a huge medical records database. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings are “very preliminary results,” Pope said — but do show slightly lower risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke for people beginning hormone therapy in perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are still a lot of unknowns, though, with limitations based on potential errors in the database and the fact that patients in perimenopause are younger to start with.&lt;/p&gt;


  







&lt;p&gt;“I can assume that it’s even safer to give hormone therapy to these women than it even is for the first 10 years after menopause, because they’re usually younger and healthier. But we still don’t really know the long-term effects of risk of heart attack, stroke or cancers, especially breast cancer, which everybody is worried about with estrogen,” Pope said. “So my thought was let’s use some retrospective data, some sort of historical data, and find women who started on hormones during this perimenopausal time, so within 10 years of going through menopause, and see what their outcomes were.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But studying 20 years of records for someone starting at age 45 is likely going to show different health outcomes than looking at patients starting at age 55. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The conclusion is, ‘OK — we see that there is maybe a little bit less of the rates associated with women who started hormones during perimenopause compared to menopause. However, this could be explained by the fact that these women are younger and we’re not following them through this same portion of their lives,” Pope said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pope also emphasized the limitations of her research, namely that because it pulls from electronic medical records, it only includes those who have been identified by their provider as biologically female. It also does not include any socioeconomic information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can’t draw the conclusion from our results that starting estrogen during perimenopause is safer,” Pope said. “We have to look at the actual data. … Drawing conclusions from data when it’s premature or making sort of overstated conclusions from data can also be harmful. As a scientist, I want nothing but to figure out what’s the best way to be able to counsel my patients and the best way to help women navigate this difficult time and not confuse them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pope said she understands why so many people were excited to see the news — especially fellow providers who felt like this confirmed what they have seen among their own patients. But, she said, she wants to make sure people understand that the study doesn’t prove that estrogen is protective. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study comes as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is set to make an announcement as soon as this week about the kind of warnings that come on estrogen-contained menopause treatments. Currently, estrogen-containing drugs carry a “&lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/10/fda-black-box-warning-menopause-estrogen-treatments/"&gt;black box warning&lt;/a&gt;,” or the strongest kind of warning issued by the FDA. The FDA is likely to remove this warning, which has been in place since 2003, on local, vaginal estrogen and possibly also systemic estrogen products, which could increase providers’ willingness to prescribe and patients’ willingness to take these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Monica Christmas, the associate medical director of the Menopause Society, stressed that what’s especially significant about the research by Pope and Chidi is that it gives us a little more data about perimenopause itself. &lt;/p&gt;


  



&lt;p&gt;“It’s great because we just don’t have a lot of touch points of information around perimenopause. A lot of what we do know is focused on post-menopause and older women. But as you know, it’s often during the perimenopause transition that symptoms are most tumultuous,” Christmas said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that while this is a retrospective study — so there’s still not a lot that can be said definitely about its results — it does help strengthen the case for hormone therapy during perimenopause to help with symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christmas said the new research suggests something that seems intuitive about perimenopause: because these patients are still having periods, albeit irregularly, and producing estrogen, the risk associated with hormone therapy is lower. Also, because big hormonal fluctuations can cause symptoms to be most intense during perimenopause, that’s a time when hormone therapy can really help stabilize things. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pope said she’s excited about the online conversations about her research but noted that the amount of misinformation about it gets at what is so complicated about the menopause content landscape right now. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I love that awareness of perimenopause and menopause is happening through social media. I appreciate seeing physicians and health care providers out there giving people information and empowering women to come in and seek care,” Pope said. “What I try to caution people about is that you should not stop there. You can’t take advice for your individual health care from a social media post.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She concluded: “I feel like I’m one of the people who tries to put good information out there, but you still need to see your own medical provider to get your own personalized, individualized care. Nothing replaces that.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your number on the bathroom scale could be misleading. New research finds that a substantial portion of people with “normal” weight still have obesity—and the higher risk of other health problems that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large, international team of scientists examined survey data from the World Health Organization. They found that roughly one in five people worldwide with a healthy body mass index (BMI) show clear signs of abdominal obesity, or excess body fat. These skinny-fat individuals were also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure. Doctors could be missing important health issues if they only focus on their patients’ BMI, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Relying solely on BMI may be insufficient to identify these high-risk individuals and provide timely interventions,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840296"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;“Normal” but obese&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BMI is calculated using a person’s weight and height, with obesity traditionally defined as having a BMI of 30 and over. In recent years, however, some doctors and patients have pushed for an expansion of what should be considered obese.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In January, a large group of obesity experts, backed by organizations like the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/say-bye-to-just-bmi-experts-call-for-a-major-shift-in-how-we-measure-obesity-2000549992"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; alternative criteria for diagnosing obesity. This criterion asks doctors to either use BMI alongside one other measurement of excess body fat or to rely on these other measurements entirely. One such measurement is waist circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers analyzed data from the WHO STEPS survey, a long-running project &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/tools-and-toolkits/who-stepwise-approach-to-surveillance"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt; by the WHO that allows countries to keep track of their residents’ risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, particularly those related to their lifestyle. In total, they looked at nearly a half million participants across 91 countries between 2000 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, 21% of respondents met the threshold for “normal-weight abdominal obesity,” meaning they had a healthy BMI but a large enough waistline to be categorized as obese. Compared to people with a normal BMI and healthy waistline, this group also had a higher prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Not just BMI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recent research has highlighted the importance of moving past BMI alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study earlier this month, for instance, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-staggering-number-of-americans-are-now-considered-obese-under-new-definition-2000673086"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 70% of Americans today meet the newer definition of obesity; this included 25% of Americans who had a normal BMI but other measures of excess body fat, such as waist circumference. This study also found that people with skinny obesity had a higher overall risk of health problems than nonobese people. That said, the authors of the latest study say theirs is the first to examine how common this form of hidden obesity is across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than wholly abandon BMI altogether, the study researchers argue that doctors should use it in combination with these other measurements to truly get a better sense of their patients’ overall cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest the need to use both BMI and waist circumference together, rather than in isolation, to provide a more complete and accurate assessment of cardiometabolic risk across diverse populations,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These results should also motivate the average person to get a thorough checkup at their next physical, one that doesn’t just stop at BMI.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

When mother mice had limited nesting material, their maternal care decreased, leading to higher stress hormones, slower growth, and anxiety-like behaviors in their pups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that these behavioral effects varied over time—some attachment responses weakened while others remained stable. Researchers say the findings help clarify how inconsistent or inadequate caregiving shapes long-term emotional and physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired Care Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Limited nesting reduced maternal care and raised stress hormones in mouse pups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attachment Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Pups showed reduced vocalization, approach, and bonding behaviors as early as two weeks old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threshold Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; The research supports that caregiving need not be perfect—just sufficient to avoid developmental harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children can sometimes develop health, behavioral, and attachment issues that persist when their needs are not met by their caregiver. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New from &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;, Arie Kaffman and colleagues at Yale University School of Medicine explored whether mouse pups also experience these issues from early life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discoveries provide an opportunity for researchers to explore the mechanisms of health and behavioral deficits from early life adversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers limited bedding for making nests, this impaired maternal care and increased stress hormone signaling in pups after just 1 week. Offspring also experienced long-term stunted growth trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, while some attachment behaviors remained unchanged, many were affected: Pups vocalized less when they were separated from their mothers after 1 week, did not approach their mothers after about 2 weeks, and had anxiety-like behavior by week 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Kaffman, “Giving credit where credit is due, work in rats relates an increased stress response from impaired maternal care to attachment deficits. But this work was only done in one age group. We used thorough, 24/7 videotape footage of moms and their pups to show how impaired maternal care leads to attachment deficits at different timepoints.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaffman emphasizes that this isn’t a linear relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that there is a threshold for how bad maternal care must be to disrupt the offspring’s behavior. This supports an existing hypothesis that you don’t have to be a perfect parent, you just need to provide adequate care.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761593000699"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What did researchers find about maternal care and early adversity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; When mother mice lacked materials to build proper nests, their caregiving declined, and their pups showed higher stress and attachment problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761593016891"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did early adversity affect the pups’ development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Pups experienced stunted growth, elevated stress hormones, and anxiety-like behavior that persisted into later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761593033277"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What does this mean for understanding parenting and development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The study suggests that while perfect caregiving isn’t required, consistent and adequate care is crucial for healthy emotional and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this childhood neglect and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9a4acada0a889baafa7e7a6bbae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0249-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erratic Maternal Care Induces Avoidant-Like Attachment Deficits in a Mouse Model of Early Life Adversity&lt;/a&gt;” by Arie Kaffman et al. &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erratic Maternal Care Induces Avoidant-Like Attachment Deficits in a Mouse Model of Early Life Adversity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attachment theory offers an important clinical framework for understanding and treating negative effects of early life adversity. Attachment styles emerge during critical periods of development in response to caregivers’ ability to consistently meet their offspring’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attachment styles are classified as secure or insecure (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized), with rates of insecure attachment rising in high-risk populations and correlating with a plethora of negative health outcomes throughout life. Despite its importance, little is known about the neural basis of attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work in rats has demonstrated that limited bedding and nesting (LB) impairs maternal care and produces abnormal maternal attachment linked to increased pup corticosterone. However, the effects of LB on attachment-like behavior have not been investigated in mice where additional genetic and molecular tools are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, no group has utilized home-cage monitoring to link abnormal maternal care with deficits in attachment-like behavior. Using home-cage monitoring, we confirmed a robust increase in maternal fragmentation among LB dams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormal maternal care was correlated with elevated corticosterone levels on post-natal day seven (P7) and a stunted growth trajectory that persisted later in life. LB did not alter maternal buffering at P8 or maternal preference at P18, indicating that certain attachment-like behaviors remain unaffected despite exposure to high levels of erratic maternal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, LB male and female pups vocalized less in response to maternal separation at P8, did not readily approach their dam at P13, and exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior at P18, suggesting that LB induces avoidant-like attachment deficits in mice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 19:34:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9QZndlZGJiMVE3V2ZNWVRDTDRYcXlmaEthTExQdDVoZXlMbnBEVzRQS0pKLTJCRnBwanNwS0tqdkNTTXBzRzdtSmh6YVlEaXlMYW11TjBVQUdkcThaVk9PMFlDNVpXaXFrWS1kZXh5UFdjcGF4</guid></item><item><title>医疗专业人士正在揭示秘密“死亡陷阱”的日常活动- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyzinman/medical-experts-normal-activities-dangerous</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Scientists found that under psychedelic exposure, neurons in the claustrum—a region dense with psychedelic-sensitive receptors—intensified their communication with the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in mood and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strengthening did not occur under normal conditions, suggesting psychedelics uniquely promote synaptic plasticity in key neural circuits. The findings provide a potential explanation for why psychedelic experiences are often intensely memorable and may support lasting therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Region:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychedelics enhance activity in the claustrum, a brain hub rich in serotonin receptors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Encoding:&lt;/strong&gt; Under psychedelics, connections between the claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex strengthen—possibly encoding vivid memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; This rewiring may help explain why psychedelic experiences aid recovery in depression, PTSD, and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using psychedelics to treat psychiatric diseases has become less controversial as scientists continue to reveal their underlying mechanisms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;eNeuro &lt;/em&gt;paper, researchers led by Pavel Ortinski, from the University of Kentucky, used male rats to assess how psychedelic drugs target the claustrum, a brain region with many receptors that psychedelics interact with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113578"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/psychedelics-memory-mental-health-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Neurons are thought to encode memories by strengthening their connections with other neurons, so this pathway may be the mechanism through which psychedelics intensify memories. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that activating claustrum neurons targeting a cognitive area implicated in psychiatric diseases (the anterior cingulate cortex) under psychedelic drug exposure strengthened projections onto these claustrum neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not occur when activating the neurons in normal conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Ortinski, “One idea is that the intensely memorable experience common during psychedelic ‘trips’ is critical for success in psychiatric treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons are thought to encode memories by strengthening their connections with other neurons, so this pathway may be the mechanism through which psychedelics intensify memories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortinski hopes to continue exploring whether this mechanism contributes to the success of psychedelics in alleviating psychiatric disease symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761589849854"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;

Why are psychedelic experiences so vivid and long-lasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The drugs may heighten the brain’s ability to form strong memory traces, embedding emotionally charged or transformative experiences more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b363e3f323a1b283d357534293c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0047-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychedelics Reverse the Polarity of Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity in Cortical-Projecting Claustrum Neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Pavel Ortinski et al. &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelics Reverse the Polarity of Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity in Cortical-Projecting Claustrum Neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic drugs have garnered increasing attention for their therapeutic potential in treating a variety of psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claustrum (CLA), a brain area with remarkable interconnectivity to frontal cortices, has recently been shown to have a dense population of serotonin 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) that are activated by psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because psychedelic therapy can require as little as one treatment session, it has been speculated that psychedelics achieve their long-term remedial effects by inducing neuroplasticity in brain areas responsible for psychiatric disease states, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effects of psychedelics on synaptic plasticity in serotonin receptor-rich brain areas remain entirely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We applied pre-synaptic stimuli paired with post-synaptic action potentials to a subpopulation of CLA neurons projecting to ACC in male rats to find that the psychedelic drug, DOI, reverses the polarity of synaptic plasticity from long-term depression (LTD) to long-term potentiation (LTP) in a manner that may reflect contribution of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission, but is specific to synapses activated by local electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we characterize intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CLA-ACC neurons with and without DOI application, noting several changes to action potential dynamics induced by DOI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with the view that psychedelics induce rapid and lasting synaptic plasticity and strengthen the hypothesis that claustro-cortical circuits are highly sensitive to psychedelic drug action.&lt;/p&gt;

since the start of September as a virulent strain of bird flu sweeps the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), the German government agency responsible for monitoring animal pestilence, there have been 30 registered outbreaks in poultry batteries and another 73 among wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And we're expecting more," a spokesperson told the dpa news agency, explaining that another 23 suspected cases are currently being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FLI, outbreaks of bird flu usually emerge at the start of November at the height of the migratory season, meaning that the current pestilence could yet to reach its peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south-western state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/rhineland-palatinate/t-18967902"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;, local authorities said new suspected cases were reaching them on a daily basis and spoke of an "unusual dynamic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bird flu in Germany: where are the most affected areas?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst affected areas are the northern and eastern states of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lower-saxony/t-18967666"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; (20 cases), &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/thuringia/t-18968071"&gt;Thuringia&lt;/a&gt; (19), &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/brandenburg/t-18968125"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt; (19) and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/mecklenburg-western-pomerania/t-18968236"&gt;Mecklenburg-West Pomerania&lt;/a&gt; (14). But cases have also been confirmed in the southern state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bavaria/t-18968282"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; (eight) and the western state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/north-rhine-westphalia/t-18943637"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; (five).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cranes have reportedly been particularly badly affected, with emergency services in northern Brandenburg, just north of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/berlin/t-18967759"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, having to dispose of thousands of infected, dead animals left strewn across fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FLI, the outbreaks are being caused by the highly infectious H5N-1 strain of the HPAIV influenza virus – commonly known as bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is bird flu dangerous for humans?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high doses, the virus is theoretically transmissible to humans, but the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/robert-koch-institute-rki/t-70901522"&gt;Robert Koch Institute (RKI)&lt;/a&gt;, Germany's federal agency for disease control and prevention, isn't aware of any such cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the effect on humans could be more likely to be felt in the pocket, with Bavarian Poultry Union chairman Robert Schmack warning of a potential 40% increase in the price of eggs and a smaller choice of poultry products in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president of the Central German Poultry Union, Hans-Peter Goldknick, however, disagrees, telling public broadcaster &lt;em&gt;ZDF &lt;/em&gt;that he is "not expecting price explosions in the short term," nor in the build-up to Christmas, not least because most geese in Germany are imported from Hungary and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help prevent the spread of the virus, the FLI recommends avoiding contact with dead birds and not wearing dirty boots near pens holding vulnerable animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the German parliament, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bundestag-germanys-lower-house-of-parliament/t-19153330"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;, a spokeswoman for the opposition &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/germanys-green-party/t-17365878"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; said that the current outbreak of bird flu had revealed the "vulnerability of factory farming," where packed pens provide optimal conditions for the virus to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

But about 30 minutes after the woman closed her eyes, Scott saw the telltale signs of sleep from the electroencephalogram, or EEG: a shift to lower-frequency brainwaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The woman progressed into deep sleep, and “was there for quite a while”, Scott said. Then, the woman suddenly woke up, saying she had to go to the bathroom. As Scott detached her from the machines, the participant apologized, saying she felt terrible she hadn’t been able to fall asleep yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She was absolutely adamant that she hadn’t slept,” Scott said, who had just watched her sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When a person is sleeping, but doesn’t know they are, this is called sleep state misperception. If woken up, a person will say they were awake the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s a frequent issue in insomnia, said Matthew Reid, a neuroscientist and sleep researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. An insomniac may say they have barely slept, but when tested in a sleep lab, they might actually be sleeping a normal number of hours per night. This leads to a conundrum: how does someone feel rested when they are sleeping enough – but just not realizing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This experience, which afflicts a significant number of insomniacs, has had various names: paradoxical insomnia, subjective insomnia, sleep state misperception and, most recently, subjective-objective sleep discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By any name, the phenomenon reveals that we don’t always know when we’re asleep or awake, and that our beliefs about sleep influence how rested we feel. At the same time, researchers are finding that people with paradoxical insomnia may not be entirely wrong; there may be something real that lies between sleeping and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Paradoxical insomnia is a subcategory of insomnia. People with it report that they only sleep a few hours a night and don’t feel rested. But sleep studies show they are getting more sleep than that – sometimes even a typical amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with insomnia seem to suffer from straightforward problems: trouble falling asleep, staying asleep and getting enough sleep to feel rested. Their sleep issues make them tired during the day; they have difficulty concentrating, and feel irritable and grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But total sleep time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213000452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;doesn’t always differ by much&lt;/a&gt; between healthy sleepers and people with insomnia. On average, according to one meta-analysis, insomniacs sleep just &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13802#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20of%20such,.%2C%202010%2C%202017)." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;23 minutes&lt;/a&gt; less per night than healthy sleepers. If time asleep isn’t the whole story, what is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of course, some people need more sleep than others. But it turns out some people don’t perceive their sleep accurately. They do not seem to remember that they did sleep. They may sleep a full night, but not feel rested. These studies revealed that insomnia can be a more complex experience than it appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"19b1fb7e-e13b-4e36-b997-9f6ddd304184","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="19b1fb7e-e13b-4e36-b997-9f6ddd304184" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1959, French doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079225000498" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first described&lt;/a&gt; a patient whose observed sleep time didn’t match up with how many hours she thought she slept. The doctors named the condition &lt;em&gt;fausse insomnie&lt;/em&gt; or false insomnia, and believed it was caused by her being overly worried about sleep. Since then, many sleep doctors and researchers have noticed that insomniacs’ sleep complaints don’t always align with the amount of sleep they are observed to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers don’t have a unified estimate of exactly how prevalent paradoxical insomnia is because it has multiple names. But it’s far from rare, Reid said. By &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/597772918.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, about half of people with insomnia sleep less than six hours a night, while the other half sleep more than six hours, an amount comparable to good sleepers’ sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-experiences-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who experiences paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people – even good sleepers – may think they’re still awake in the early stages of sleep. But people with paradoxical insomnia are more likely to think they’re awake after the first two hours. They are also more likely to report feeling awake during REM sleep, when almost all good sleepers will report accurately that they were sleeping. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34710350/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;serial awakening&lt;/a&gt; studies, people with insomnia who are woken up multiple times throughout the night will report being awake when they had actually been asleep more often than good sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thomas Andrillon, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute, has a hunch that awareness during sleep is more nuanced than previously believed. In experiments about &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2016/1/niw014/2757134" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;memory and learning during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, he would see someone sleep, confirmed by their brain activity in real time. Afterwards, they would insist they hadn’t slept. Andrillon realized he had experienced this himself, and that plenty of others did, too – such as his students, who would fall asleep in class, but have no idea they had drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most people have gone through this, even if they’re not insomniacs. For instance, when I’m trying to sleep before an early morning flight, I usually feel like I haven’t even slept an hour. Yet I can recall a dream about, say, sleeping through my alarm, which tells me otherwise. I’ve sat next to a family member on an overnight flight who peacefully passes out, only to arrive at our destination and complain they didn’t sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But brain imaging done by Andrillon and his colleagues is suggesting that insomniacs with discrepancies between their sleep and wake times might not be entirely wrong. Instead, they might be noticing a unique altered state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep researchers determine someone is sleeping when they lose awareness of the world around them, and when their brain activity shifts to high-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations. EEG readouts will feature sleep signatures like slow waves and sleep spindles, or specific &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31804897" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bursts&lt;/a&gt; in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But commonly used observational techniques might miss the nuances of brain activity during the transition into sleep, or the moments between sleep stages, Andrillon said. The technology might not be sensitive enough to capture “wake-like” brain activity that could explain the feeling of being awake while sleeping. Andrillon said that when other researchers have studied deeper areas of the brain, they found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811924002799" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;signs of arousal&lt;/a&gt;, even when people seemed asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fact that they look like they’re sleeping is true only at a superficial level,” Andrillon said. “When you dive a bit more in the details of the brain activity, you see signs of wakefulness that you will typically not see during normal or standard sleep.” Experts are now shifting to the term subjective-objective sleep discrepancy, or SOSD, rather than paradoxical insomnia or sleep state misperception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-07794-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; from March, in a group of more than 800 people with insomnia, 24% had subjective-objective sleep discrepancies. Andrillon and his colleagues found differences in the physiological profile between the two kinds of insomniacs. People with SOSD didn’t wake up very often, but when they did, their waking state was tainted with signatures of sleep, which could influence their judgment about not sleeping well or not having slept, he said. Conversely, the sleep of insomniacs without SOSD had wake-like features, meaning their sleep was of a lesser quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-solutions-for-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there solutions for paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/23/cbt-i-sleep-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is a well-researched and effective way to improve sleeping habits. It seems to help people with SOSD, too. In a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.14142" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from last year, Scott and colleagues found CBT-I had no difference in positive outcomes for people with regular insomnia, compared with those who had SOSD. Other studies have shown that CBT-I &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29402512/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31422853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;improve issues related to&lt;/a&gt; SOSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It won’t be useful to become overly worried about whether you’re getting the perfect amount of sleep, Scott said. There is an association between SOSD and anxious or worried thoughts about sleep, so try not to pile on additional worries. “People who have [SOSD] tend to have certain thoughts, very often involving rumination about worries of the day, worries of not sleeping, not being able to sleep,” Andrillon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, a helpful tool for paradoxical insomnia could be a strategy called paradoxical intention, which encourages poor sleepers to stop trying so hard to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previously, people who could not tell they were asleep were perceived to have flawed judgment. Actually, SOSD is a reminder that we don’t know everything about what it means to be asleep, and to know that we have slept. “We’re going back to it and seeing that it’s actually pretty real,” Andrillon said. “We have just been overlooking this aspect of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 18:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQSkx6UmtfSUlyRFNNSjdvVGRtdy0zVjEwWklsdnNCV1ZBVUFtZGhJMGVuNUpoZl83a2VTM2t1aDgzMGRUNVhleTF1RFd2ZGI0M0NmMlpILXJZS0NydEdVY2tRWld6RWloS3Y4QVV3bDhEWkhVMmdIVmxGMlptZlNyNg</guid></item><item><title>一名男子说，当他的嘴唇开始肿胀时，他正在吃玉米饼。然后他意识到他对“完全正常的成分”过敏- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/man-says-eating-tacos-lips-171500092.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of tacos&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man said on Reddit that after years of thinking he was a "wimp" with spicy food, he recently learned he actually has an allergy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big plot twist" happened when he slathered on the salsa verde at a recent family BBQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he thought it was normal for his lips to swell up like that, his family quickly realized something else was going on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, a man said he believed he had “zero” tolerance for spicy foods. However, he recently learned he was just allergic to a "totally normal ingredient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nyh9e7/tifu_by_realizing_im_not_a_wimp_just_allergic_and/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, the 29-year-old man said he had long believed that he was a “lightweight” when it came to spicy foods. Salsa verde, he noted, was his biggest adversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single time I ate it, my lips would get a little puffy and tingly,’ the Redditor explained. “It wasn't like, scary swollen, but it was noticeable. I just thought, ‘Okay, cool. This is what a 'mild' spice feels like for a wimp like me.’ It was my normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big plot twist happened last Sunday at a family BBQ. We're all eating tacos, and I slather on the salsa verde," the man continued. "Within a few minutes, I feel the familiar puff-up starting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when he told his sister, "Whoa, this green salsa has a real kick today. My lip is already getting fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, he said his sister replied, "Dude, that's not a 'kick.' Your lip is actually swelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he said she pointed out that there actually weren't even any chiles in the salsa, it was just tomatillo and onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, something clicked in their mom’s brain. "Mijo," she said, according to her son, "That's not spice! You're allergic!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redditor said “it finally clicked” for him, too. “Turns out, my body was just having a low-key allergic meltdown to a totally normal ingredient,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before learning about his allergy, the Redditor said he occasionally would treat his tingly face with Benadryl if the sensation “felt a bit more intense than usual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the Redditor realized he was “casually treating my allergic reactions” without knowing he was actually allergic to one of the ingredients he was consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've got an appointment to figure out what exactly hates me, but for now, the jokes at my expense are absolutely relentless,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Redditors revealed they went through similar experiences before learning they were allergic to certain foods, with many writing that it took them years to realize they were experiencing allergies to some of their favorite foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were simply thankful to hear the man was able to avoid a serious allergic reaction before fully understanding his allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was a bit worried you'd found out you're actually allergic after you had had a serious reaction and had to go to a hospital,” one social media user wrote. “Glad you've figured it out before it was an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ultimately, the Redditor was urged to proceed with caution. “Allergies are very much a f--- around and find out kind of thing, you can never stop being careful,” added another commenter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mans-lips-started-swelling-up-realized-allergic-totally-normal-ingredient-11826826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:24:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9UUXZ1WXE4VGYwSVJ5aUluR3pHSXowX05saTd1VC1ra1NXemtyOEc2T08xYjRoMlhWR2ptZ19aeFVwd2R5NmkyeHN3emlhaDAySjlQSlJhc3F2N29FUTRzZ3huM2p5QVdQM2UtaUdDUFhSQ1lqT0tkNXZn</guid></item><item><title>诊断有多重要？ |治疗师在--《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/does-your-mental-health-diagnosis-matter-the-therapist-is-in/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUDBObE14bEJUd0h5MmF1WkthU1lpWVduOEZzX2w1d0RzWW56ZEwxN052VEl0bVpPZ044N2owUzdwTHNNZXNqbDBybG9VaGloUTBHeXcyTjJ3bEVnQ3o3dUU3SzhnbUxqTEE5REl5SVFuMnA5M2YxZ29HeVdSOGxVWFpWN0dkcjd5ZHBHel85RkVYbkV1eVlxNGJLSHVRVlVqOXRfT19FS0JCdEJKTmFWaHNzbkVUYUpQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How much does a diagnosis matter? | The therapist is in&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUDBObE14bEJUd0h5MmF1WkthU1lpWVduOEZzX2w1d0RzWW56ZEwxN052VEl0bVpPZ044N2owUzdwTHNNZXNqbDBybG9VaGloUTBHeXcyTjJ3bEVnQ3o3dUU3SzhnbUxqTEE5REl5SVFuMnA5M2YxZ29HeVdSOGxVWFpWN0dkcjd5ZHBHel85RkVYbkV1eVlxNGJLSHVRVlVqOXRfT19FS0JCdEJKTmFWaHNzbkVUYUpQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，这种严重的肠道疾病在年轻的美国人中神秘地上升- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-serious-gut-condition-is-mysteriously-rising-in-younger-americans-study-finds-2000677475</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A painful and serious gut problem is increasingly afflicting younger Americans, and no one’s sure why. Recent research shows that cases of severe diverticulitis among people under the age of 50 have substantially risen over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and others examined data from millions of Americans hospitalized by diverticulitis. They found that the proportion of severe, or complicated, diverticulitis cases in younger Americans noticeably increased between 2005 and 2020. The reasons for this surge are unclear, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Additional research is needed to determine the cause of these trends and identify public health policies aimed at potentially preventing the increasing burden of diverticulitis among younger populations,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diseases of the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A problematic pouch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outer wall of our large intestine can develop a pocket- or pouch-like structure alongside it, formally known as a diverticulum (diverticula for plural). These pouches are harmless on their own, and most people will never be bothered by them. But the pouches can become inflamed and/or infected: a condition we call &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10352-diverticulitis"&gt;diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most cases of diverticulitis are uncomplicated, meaning the inflammation is localized. Though painful, this form can usually be managed with rest, a change in diet, and occasionally antibiotics. Complicated cases are caused by more widespread inflammation, which can then lead to severe, potentially life-threatening issues like gastrointestinal bleeding, abscesses, and even a ruptured colon. It’s these cases that often require hospitalization and sometimes radical interventions like the surgical removal of some or all of a person’s colon (a colectomy).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases of diverticulitis, both mild and severe, are much more common in people over 50. But this latest research suggests that things are changing, and not for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A worrying trend with no clear answer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the country’s largest publicly available database of hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2020, they found, at least five million Americans were hospitalized for their diverticulitis. About 16% of these cases were early-onset, occurring in people under 50. Over time, the researchers found, more of these early-onset cases led to severe illness. During the study period, the percentage of severe diverticulitis among early-onset cases significantly increased, from 18.5% to 28.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the positive side, people with early-onset diverticulitis were less likely to die from their condition than older cases and had shorter hospital stays on average. The proportion of early-onset cases treated with colectomy also declined over time (from 35% to 20%), suggesting that doctors have gotten better at managing the condition with less intrusive measures. But younger people were also more likely to require surgery or other invasive treatments for their condition than older patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the researchers say, there’s no easy explanation for why these cases are becoming more common in younger Americans. It is possible that some of the same risk factors linked to increased early-onset cases of colorectal cancers, such as obesity, may also be driving an increase in diverticulitis. Other lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in fiber, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731157/"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to lower people’s risk of diverticulitis, and most Americans simply aren’t getting &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; in general. Younger people also seem to be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0316051"&gt;exercising less&lt;/a&gt; than earlier generations, and physical activity is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.94"&gt;another protective factor&lt;/a&gt; against diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Without more study, though, we can’t know for sure just how much these and other factors could be playing a role in early-onset diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Little is known about why we’re seeing this increase in younger patients,” said lead author Shineui Kim, a researcher at UCLA Health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-analysis-alarming-severe-diverticulitis-younger.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “We urgently need additional research to determine what’s driving these trends, whether it’s dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, men needed to reach 530 minutes, or nearly nine hours, a week to see the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study builds on previous work that suggests women benefit more than men from the same amount of exercise, but that women are generally less physically active and less likely to meet recommended exercise targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Under &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, men and women aged 16 to 64 should take at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the latest work stresses the need for tailored advice for men and women, and highlights the substantial health benefits women can achieve with only moderate amounts of exercise. Globally, one in three women die of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Compared with male individuals, females derive equivalent health benefits with only half the exercise time,” the authors write in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00732-z" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/a&gt;. “The findings might have potential to encourage females to engage in physical activity,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Jiajin Chen at Xiamen University in China and his colleagues analysed data from activity trackers worn by middle-aged volunteers enrolled in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/30/uk-biobank-and-the-masses-of-medical-data-that-became-key-to-genetic-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK Biobank project&lt;/a&gt;. They first looked at 80,243 participants who did not have coronary heart disease. In this group, women who met the 150-minute weekly exercise target had a 22% lower risk of developing heart disease over eight years of follow-up, compared with those who did not. For men, the risk was 17% lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further analysis showed that women could reduce their heart disease risk by 30% through exercising for 250 minutes a week, a benefit men only achieved on reaching 530 minutes of physical activity each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most striking result emerged from data on more than 5,000 men and women who already had coronary heart disease. Here, the researchers found that the risk of dying during the follow-up period was three times lower for women who met the weekly exercise target than for similarly active men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New AI tool can predict a person’s risk of more than 1,000 diseases, say experts","elementId":"e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/17/new-ai-tool-can-predict-a-persons-risk-of-more-than-1000-diseases-say-experts"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Yan Wang, a senior author on the paper, said the work showed both sexes could gain “substantial cardiovascular benefits” from physical activity and recommended everyone, regardless of their sex, to take regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he added that, globally, more women than men were not meeting physical activity targets. “We particularly hope that our findings could encourage physically inactive females to become more active, thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is unclear why exercise may benefit women more than men, but scientists point to differences in sex hormones, muscle fibres and the ability to break down sugar to produce energy as potential factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00734-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying article&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Emily Lau, a women’s cardiovascular health specialist at Massachusetts General hospital, writes: “This study provides further evidence that one size really does not fit all and challenges us to move from conversation to action.

He died Thursday, October 2, 2025, of complications from a spinal cord injury suffered after being hit by a car earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Tom was born seven weeks early in May 1967 to Delene and James Perley in Royal Oak, Michigan. Soon, thereafter, the family moved to Wooster, Ohio where his parents taught college and his beloved brother, Scott, was born. Tom graduated from Wooster High School in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;It was clear from an early age that Tom was different. He read advanced books at age 2 ½ but it was evident his social and emotional skills were developing differently. He wasn’t deemed autistic based on definitions of the time, but something was unique. Finally in 1994, Asperger’s Syndrome was identified; and Tom’s differences had a label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Despite his social challenges, Tom was extremely bright: won spelling bees, was terrific at giving directions (the 1970s equivalent of today’s GPS) and played the euphonium in the marching band. Tom spent summers at Camp Nuhop in Mohican State Park, a camp for children with disabilities, which his parents helped establish. Tom also loved to travel, going to many states and visiting countries in four continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Tom received a BA in Communications from Otterbein College, Westerville, Ohio in 1990. At Otterbein, Tom had a fan base as a college radio station DJ, and enjoyed being in Columbus, where he lived independently for the next 35 years. His jobs included data entry at a bank, nursing home support and vending machine pallet preparation. He took full advantage of his independence - crisscrossing Columbus on public transit, going to malls, which were his favorite, and attending festivals, movies and Broadway shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;On April 16, 2025, while in a crosswalk near his condo, Tom was hit by a turning car. The injuries from the crash resulted in tetraplegia and Tom spent the next 3 ½ months in hospitals, with his mother constantly by his side. Tom made progress with the support of the spinal cord specialists at OSU’s Dodd Rehabilitation, including learning to “drive” for the first time, using an electric wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;In late July, Tom moved to Portland, Maine to a long-term care facility, learned how to use his left hand again and wowed the residents with his trivia knowledge. Unfortunately, the spinal injury took its toll as it adversely affected his organs. He succumbed to his injuries at Maine Medical with his brother, Scott, by his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Tom is predeceased by his father (2016). He will be remembered and missed by many including his mother and brother, sister-in-law Laurel, niece Nora and nephew Nathan, aunts, uncles and cousins, co-workers, neighbors, fellow Unitarian Universalist church members, and the residents and staff at Fallbrook Commons in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Tom took a book to read wherever he went, loved his collection of stuffed animals and enjoyed drawing clever cartoons. His cheerful outlook, kind manner, wonderful sense of humor and love of music will be fondly remembered. His family and friends continue to celebrate his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Suggested donations in his memory may be sent to Camp Nuhop, 1077 Township Rd 2916, Perrysville OH 44864 or Friends of Dodd Rehab Services Fund 309497, University Square North, 14 E. 15th Ave, Columbus OH 43201.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;A Celebration of Tom’s Life will be at Allen Avenue Unitarian Universalist Church, 524 Allen Avenue, Portland ME, November 22 at 11 a. m.

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some research suggests that probiotics, especially strains like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, may help reduce symptoms of acid reflux and GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While some studies show positive effects, more research is needed to determine if probiotics have a place in helping people with reflux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are considering trying a probiotic for acid reflux, consult a healthcare provider for medical advice and more information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics (beneficial live microbes) may help with acid reflux symptoms, but individual experiences vary. They can be found in different sources, including foods and dietary supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some Probiotic Studies Show Acid Reflux Improvement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux&lt;/span&gt; (also called &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-acid-reflux-7570741" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;, or heartburn) occurs when the contents of your stomach flow up into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Reflux can cause heartburn or indigestion.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies have sought to determine whether &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/probiotics-7488911" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms in &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/gerd-acid-reflux-11697899" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&lt;/a&gt;, a more severe, chronic form of acid reflux.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to research:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Findings from a 2020 review of 13 studies noted improvement in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/symptoms-of-gerd-1742343" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms of GERD,&lt;/a&gt; such as regurgitation, heartburn, nausea, stomach pain, and gas (burping and gurgling).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 2018 study of children with GERD who took probiotics found that those who also took a type of acid-reducing medication called a &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/proton-pump-inhibitors-what-they-do-and-how-they-work-8727585" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;proton pump inhibitor&lt;/a&gt; (PPI), such as Prilosec (omeprazole), had significantly fewer digestive symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the findings, further research is needed to confirm that probiotics are effective for this use.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Health Experts Have No Specific Guidelines &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the opinion of health experts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)&lt;/strong&gt; has not issued specific guidelines or made comments on the use of probiotics for GERD, either for or against it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The International Probiotics Association&lt;/strong&gt; says that while GERD treatment should always begin with lifestyle changes, probiotics can be a helpful addition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's best to check with your healthcare provider&lt;/strong&gt; for specific medical advice related to your condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

How Long They Take to Work Varies &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The length of time may vary based on individual factors such as type and severity of symptoms. In the review of studies, some people noticed an improvement in symptoms within one or two weeks, while others noted an improvement in symptoms after 12 weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Best Probiotic Strains for Acid Reflux May Vary &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While perusing the dietary supplement aisle, you'll likely see dozens of probiotics—but which are the best options for acid reflux? Studies include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 2018 study on children with GERD, the researchers found positive results with the probiotic strain &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus reuteri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2020 review of studies noted limited evidence to compare probiotic strains and how well they work. However, the researchers noted that studies that looked at the strains &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-health-benefits-of-bifobacterium-4684233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all reported positive effects on GERD symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a personalized recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Side Effects Are Usually Minimal &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the review of clinical studies, many people reported experiencing no side effects. A few people reported gas and bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Typically, probiotics are well tolerated. If you do experience side effects, they'll generally be minor and include gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, like gas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are not always safe or appropriate for everyone. You should always check with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications or supplements, including a probiotic. Probiotics may not be safe for certain people, such as:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Take the following steps to ensure safe use:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You can do this by putting blocks or books under the legs at the head of your bed or placing a wedge under the mattress. Do not just use pillows to prop your head up, as doing so can increase pressure on the stomach and make symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid large meals, instead opting for smaller and more frequent meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear clothes that fit comfortably around the stomach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop smoking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid alcohol if possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lose weight, if needed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-featuredquote__quote-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-featuredquote__quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GERD occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation. While probiotics show promise, they are not a proven standalone treatment and should be used alongside other evidence-based strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under local anesthesia, a woman in England was able to play her clarinet for the first time in 5 years whilst receiving treatment for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep-brain stimulation (DBS) procedure promised, if successful, to restore motor control in the patient’s hands such that she would be able to play her beloved instrument again, and the surgeon asked her to bring it with her to test the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting video makes for quite the sight, as the surgery team behind the plastic sanitary screen sat listening in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65-year-old Denise Bacon from Crowborough, in the English county of East Sussex, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2014, and she gradually lost the ability to do her favorite things such as swim, dance, and play the clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS is a surgical procedure that delivers an electrical current to electrodes implanted in the brain, and is suitable for some patients with disorders such as Parkinson’s. Her skull and scalp were numbed with anesthesia, but she stayed during the four hour intervention, which is when she was asked to play the clarinet to see if her motor control had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SIMILAR STORY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq83k7l7jyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she told the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m already experiencing improvements in my ability to walk, and I’m keen to get back in the swimming pool, and on the dance floor to see if my abilities have improved there.”&lt;/p&gt;

Among these pregnancies, 18,893 stillbirths were identified. The researchers examined associations between these stillbirths and a variety of clinical factors, including gestational age at delivery; pregnancy risks such as obesity, pregnancy-related and chronic hypertension, gestational and pre-pregnancy diabetes, and substance use; fetal risks, such as decreased movement, growth restriction, and anomalies; and obstetric risks, such as history of stillbirth or adverse pregnancy outcomes and low or excess amniotic fluid levels.

The rate was even higher for families living in low-income areas, where 1 in every 112 births ended in stillbirth. The researchers also observed that the stillbirth rate was 1 in every 95 births in areas with higher proportions of Black families compared to White families. Stillbirth rates did not significantly vary according to rurality and levels of access to obstetric care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study also found that while 72.3% of stillbirths had at least one clinical risk factor, a sizable portion of stillbirths occurred with no identified clinical risk factor.

Later gestational ages showed the highest rates of having no clinical risk factor: Among stillbirths that occurred at 38 weeks gestation, 24.1% had no risk factor; at 39 weeks, 34.2%; and at 40+ weeks, 40.7%.

 &lt;h2&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stillbirth burden in the U.S. is higher than previously reported, with over 1 in 150 births ending in stillbirth. The rate is even higher—1 in 112—in low-income areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 70% of stillbirths occurred in pregnancies with at least one identified clinical risk factor (e.g. chronic hypertension), but a substantial share—especially those occurring at 40+ weeks gestation—had none.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the researchers, the findings point to a need to improve stillbirth prevention among pregnancies with identified risk factors as well as improve stillbirth risk prediction, especially later in pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
