Born in San Francisco in 1907, Branyas moved to Catalonia in 1915 and survived two world wars, the Spanish civil war and the Covid pandemic, recovering from the virus aged 113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72cdd26f-fbd6-4d18-8c05-273b846f9a79" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why do the children of elderly patients stay away?

The tests delved into her genetics and the extent to which different genes were switched on and off; the varieties and levels of proteins in her blood, the breakdown products from reactions in her body and the diversity of microbes in her gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among a trove of discoveries, they found that protective caps called telomeres on the ends of Branyas’s chromosomes were exceptionally short, a clear sign of old age in her cells. Her immune system also showed signs of old age, was prone to inflammation, and she had acquired mutations that lead to leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Branyas was seemingly well protected. Telomeres shorten whenever cells divide, and hers were so short they may have protected her from cancer by limiting the amount that cells continued to divide, Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A close look at her DNA revealed gene variants that protected her heart and brain cells from disease and dementia. She had low levels of inflammation throughout her body, which reduced her risk of cancer and diabetes, and efficient cholesterol and fat metabolism. “These are all critical because they’re linked to diseases that are typical in older people and they kill you at the end,” Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Headlines Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;newsletterId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;headlines-europe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her gut microbiome was also very young for her age with plenty of Bifidobacterium, which is also considered beneficial to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her long life was not all down to genetics, however. Branyas was not overweight, ate a lot of yoghurt, and did not smoke or drink. She had a good social life with friends and family nearby. All surely helped, Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hopes the wealth of information will help scientists develop new treatments to keep people healthy in old age. “We can develop drugs to reproduce the effects of good genes,” he said. “Maria’s parents gave her very good genes, but we cannot choose our parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof João Pedro de Magalhães at the University of Birmingham, said: “These outliers in longevity could provide insights into how to age more gracefully. If we could figure out which specific genes are associated with extreme human longevity and healthy old age it could provide clues about mechanisms for ageing as well as drugable targets to develop interventions that allow everyone to live longer, healthier lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOQVlLWUNNTTN1MzEyel9VQlRFVTBRVXlFNlhJMXZ4aDdfSm5KQ29VQXpyTFBYd3B4enBYLVZVVTd1TG9EMU1wVTU4Y1FhNkxEdHMwUXF0NlNiOEN6dElFaUswdE9NVnJhb3NhcXpOQXJ1R3UzMzdOYzlUR3RfZVlCY3ZhNFktNDl6T2hBSnFORTlueVVhdml6UE5CYWxKOGY2N1VfU0doVFkxWVZyanprT25iTUVBc2x1eDRj</guid></item><item><title>美国“噩梦细菌”病例正在增加- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/nightmare-bacteria-cases-are-increasing-us-rcna233398</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-477564" class="body-graf"&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f91760" class="body-graf"&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Kennedy Jr. broke with long-standing U.S. precedent on Covid shots and childhood immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;changes by the group&lt;/a&gt;, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could complicate access in some states and add to public confusion around U.S. vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, several health experts say Americans can take steps to try to secure the vaccines they or their children want or need. For some patients in certain states, access and coverage may not change much at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a meeting in Atlanta last week, ACIP weakened Covid shot recommendations; voted against a combination jab against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, or MMRV, for children under the age of 4; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt;indefinitely postponed&lt;/a&gt; a vote on whether to change its advisory around the hepatitis B vaccine administered at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose director the Trump administration ousted in August, still needs to sign off on the recommendations. The agency typically adopts the guidance of ACIP, which issues recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108202925" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Chair Dr. Martin Kulldorff speaks with committee members and presenters before the start of an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., Sept. 19, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Alyssa Pointer | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't physically take the vaccines away, but they made it more confusing, they made it more bureaucratic, and by doing that, it disincentivizes people from getting vaccinated," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "It makes it harder for some people to get vaccinated. It creates more friction." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page" target="_blank"&gt;regional health alliances&lt;/a&gt; spanning several states are issuing broader vaccine recommendations than the federal government, and many states have signed directives that aim to preserve Covid shot access. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;several major insurance plans have pledged&lt;/a&gt; to continue covering vaccines based on the panel's previous guidance issued by former members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients uncertain about the changes, experts recommend turning to trusted health-care providers or vetted medical groups that have &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;issued their own vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the ACIP members emphasized concerns about vaccine side effects, raising doubts about shots long-proven safe and effective. That's no surprise: Kennedy purged the committee in June and named 12 new members, many of whom have long criticized vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chaotic two-day meeting followed previous steps by Kennedy to limit access to vaccines, including the CDC's decision to drop Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women, and the Food and Drug Administration's limits on who can get new Covid jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're concerned about access to shots against Covid, MMRV and hepatitis B, here's the latest on those vaccines and what you can do to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Should I get a Covid vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer should be yes if you're at high risk of severe illness from Covid, according to health experts and major medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some experts said those at low risk should at least consider getting a Covid shot, or can make their decision based on consultation with a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP advised that people 6 months and up receive vaccines based on "shared clinical decision-making," a choice made between a health-care provider and a patient or their guardian. The group also voted to emphasize that for those under 65, the Covid vaccine is most beneficial for people at high risk of severe illness from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the panel is recommending that everyone consult &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.htmlhtml" target="_blank"&gt;a health-care provider&lt;/a&gt; when deciding whether to receive a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health experts said the panel should have recommended that all people at high risk of severe illness from Covid get the shot. That includes adults ages 65 and above; those under that age with at least one condition that puts them at high risk, such as cancer, obesity or chronic kidney disease; pregnant women; and children under the age of 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is paramount for those groups, as it helps prevent severe Covid and the risk of hospitalization or death due to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their recommendation is treating Covid as if it's the same for everybody irrespective of risk, and that's the wrong way to think about it," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "Any high-risk group should always stay up to date with the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view largely aligns with guidance from professional medical organizations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that all children ages 6 months through 23 months get an updated shot, along with older children ages 2 years through 18 years in certain risk groups or who are in close contact with people at high risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that patients receive an updated Covid vaccine at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period or when lactating. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that all adults 19 years and older receive an updated shot, with a particular emphasis on those at high risk or people who have never received a Covid vaccine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two regional health alliances comprised of several states – The Northeast Public Health Collaborative and the West Coast Health Alliance – have &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;based their Covid vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on the guidance from those three organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adalja said it is reasonable for a person at low risk of severe illness to rely on a conversation with a provider when determining whether to get a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Richard Dang, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California, said he recommends everyone consider getting a Covid shot regardless of their risk level. Dang is also &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/richard-h-dang/" target="_blank"&gt;a liaison member&lt;/a&gt; representing the American Pharmacists Association in the Covid vaccine work group of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from reducing the severity of illness from the virus, some data shows vaccines can help prevent some symptoms of long Covid and other complications that people develop after an infection, according to Dang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy individuals should also think about family and others around them who may be at higher risk of severe illness, said Dr. Pamela Rockwell, a clinical professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinating yourself may potentially save another life by not potentially infecting them with a vaccine-preventable disease," Rockwell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several medical experts have emphasized the importance of vaccines as the U.S. heads into the fall and winter, when infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viruses like Covid, spread more easily. While hospitalizations and deaths from Covid have decreased significantly from previous years, the virus is still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How is Covid shot access changing? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to Covid vaccines will largely hinge on the state a patient lives in, so health experts recommend Americans check with their providers, local health departments or nearby pharmacies about how they can get a shot and whether they need to meet any new requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adalja said the easiest way to access a shot may be to go to a doctor's office. But the vast majority of Americans get their vaccines from pharmacies. Pharmacy rules vary by state, and not all states currently allow pharmacists to give shots outside of the CDC recommended population without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access will likely be unchanged in states within the two regional health alliances. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative is made up of New Jersey, New York state, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Vermont and New York City. Meanwhile, the West Coast Health Alliance has California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many of those states, governors had previously issued executive orders to preserve Covid vaccine access – though directives have varied. For example, in California, &lt;a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab144" target="_blank"&gt;a new law&lt;/a&gt; allows pharmacists to independently prescribe and administer the shot as long as the state health department recommends it. The law also requires insurance plans to cover the vaccines the state endorses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as of Sept. 23, pharmacists in Florida are not allowed to provide vaccinations without a prescription from a health-care provider like a physician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some states where the pharmacist may be skittish to give out the Covid vaccine, and that may impact access for some people," University of Michigan's Rockwell said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108202925" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Chair Dr. Martin Kulldorff speaks with committee members and presenters before the start of an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., Sept. 19, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Alyssa Pointer | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement Monday, CVS said it currently offers the updated Covid vaccine to patients with an authorized prescription in the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia. CVS said it will be able to offer the Covid shot without a prescription in those states after the CDC approves ACIP's new recommendations around the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it already offers Covid vaccines without a prescription requirement in all other states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Walgreens said it continues to administer the shot without prescriptions in the "vast majority" of states. But the company will offer the updated Covid vaccines at locations to people ages 3 and older, no prescription required, after the CDC adopts the panel's recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, insurance coverage for Covid vaccines should largely remain the same for many children and adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP's recommendation allows for coverage "through all payment mechanisms," according to an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;HHS release&lt;/a&gt;. That includes the Vaccines for Children Program, Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, Medicare and plans through the federal health insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major health insurance group last week said its member plans &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/members" target="_blank"&gt;will cover all vaccines&lt;/a&gt; through 2026 based on ACIP recommendations in place as of Sept. 1 — before the changes made by the new slate of members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member plans of the group, America's Health Insurance Plans, collectively provide coverage and services to more than 200 million Americans. That includes more than a dozen Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, Centene, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS/"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;' Aetna, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ELV/"&gt;Elevance Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HUM/"&gt;Humana&lt;/a&gt;, Kaiser Permanente, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MOH/"&gt;Molina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CI/"&gt;Cigna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group doesn't cover everyone, so experts recommend that patients contact their plans about the Covid shot. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UNH/"&gt;UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt;, the country's largest private health insurer, is not a member of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can my child take the MMRV vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108108653" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Sherry Andrews, right, holds 13-month-old Jaqi Herrera’s hand after administering the first MMR vaccine dose to Herrera at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. Feb. 27, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Annie Rice | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a child under 4, it may be more difficult for them to access the combination MMRV vaccine as their first dose. Children older than 4 shouldn't have an issue getting that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, ACIP voted to no longer recommend the combination MMRV shot for children under age 4. Instead, the committee said young children should receive one vaccine for chickenpox and a different shot known as MMR that inoculates against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC still recommends two doses of measles-containing vaccine for children, starting with the first dose at age 12 months to 15 months, and a second at age 4 years to 6 years. The agency previously recommended that children under 4 take the separate MMR shot and chickenpox vaccine or – if families and physicians have a preference – the MMRV vaccine for their first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP's vote does not affect children older than 4, meaning that they can still take the MMRV shot as their second dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the panel's discussion last week focused on the slightly increased risk of seizures accompanied by fever in young children who have received the first dose of the combined MMRV vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, said that young children can get those so-called febrile seizures from anything that causes a fever, such as an ear infection or a cold. He called it "disappointing to restrict choices for parents" by recommending against the MMRV shot for younger kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-container"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"&gt;&lt;h2 class="RelatedContent-header"&gt;More CNBC health coverage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Blumberg also noted that the vote may not make much of a difference for some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 85% of children currently get the MMR and chickenpox vaccines separately for their first dose, according to data collected by the CDC. About 15% of kids get a single dose of the combination MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It made no sense that they would actually need to take a vote on this because there was nothing new to say about it. The majority of people were getting the shots separately anyway," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "But when ACIP can get everybody revved up about a combination vaccine and take some kind of vote like that, it scores points with the anti-vaccine movement – even though it's really irrelevant to the practice of medicine." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a briefing on Monday, President &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the MMR vaccine should be separated into three shots, alleging that "it seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMR shot has long been safe and effective, and is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;credited &lt;/a&gt;with saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S. Vaccines that protect against just one of the three diseases are also not available in the U.S. due to widespread adoption of the combined shot. Separating the shot into three could hurt uptake, as it could require children to make multiple trips to the doctor's office rather than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has already &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000" target="_blank"&gt;logged the most measles cases&lt;/a&gt; this year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can my baby take the hepatitis B shot?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP postponed a vote on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B shot from birth to at least one month for most babies born in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision means that the committee's current recommendation – that all infants receive a hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth – will stay in place until the group meets again at a later date. It's unclear when the panel will convene again to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponed vote will only affect the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between six and 18 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying the so-called birth dose would change a safe and highly effective recommendation that was introduced in 1991 and is credited with virtually eliminating the disease in young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they're considering is ignoring history," said UC Davis' Blumberg. He said infants face a high risk of getting chronically infected, which can lead to severe health problems, including liver cancer and failure, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumberg said eliminating a universal birth dose recommendation will "return us to where we were, having about 1,000 kids every year getting infected with hepatitis B during that period" of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump on Monday advocated delaying hepatitis B vaccines until age 12. He suggested that most cases of the disease are sexually transmitted, but infants are susceptible to getting the disease from their mother during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't understand that the fact that you vaccinate at birth is to protect the child who's coming through the birth canal of a person who could be infected. That's what the hepatitis B dose is about," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "The vaccine is safe in that child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said some women test positive after their initial test for the virus during pregnancy or can have a false negative, making the birth dose a crucial tool for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-2"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-container"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"&gt;&lt;h2 class="RelatedContent-header"&gt;Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQWRUdUZnZVYzN2ZNZC1wRHBRRXRDTy03ZGd6N2M5Q0hMbTdpMWhwSHpzMlc0Tlk1Y3E0SFBXTDY1X3hKV1FuRk1KTTItSUdKUUlkbFVHX0ZIYjEzbEU2MDJLc1BlVzlFZTY1VHZmQ1VSZWgyNVUxczR0cE5VWFFIZjByM0PSAYoBQVVfeXFMUGN1eVVpdXBmb2c4N2dzZ3BSclJYdEwzbDktMExmZVlRdzRkcnNoVHRPQWQ1cmc1eXBTeWVPUnlpSGJzSGo3SnF6R3NEbnRxZjFZV0lTRWR1cnpKZERtcDd2eEFybk9yU2dTcTFPWmdDR2p5T0owUVhzemhwalVmTWc4cDZSZkVZaDVB</guid></item><item><title>您吃喝的东西会导致脱发-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-you-eat-and-drink-can-contribute-to-your-hair-loss/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPN0RRTlRjR0VpbS10am91VDlZdVQzd295ZHkyV1dKZDBkNERtUldoWW5DTW9nMnpHbmxFZDhiUGQ0R194aFhtaFVkOFAyZHI1QjhMVzNqV3lMd0JDYWVra0UtRWxpaGtvWEdCaFF1N0J4THZoWVRvZk1Db1k5UkFOcm1KNTgxQ1dFNWJHcXowYnFCRWVzang1ZzduUnlOekNjV3FpcHpTak8?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What you eat and drink can contribute to your hair loss&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lFc1liTER4RU94WlJib3dBanF5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:29:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPN0RRTlRjR0VpbS10am91VDlZdVQzd295ZHkyV1dKZDBkNERtUldoWW5DTW9nMnpHbmxFZDhiUGQ0R194aFhtaFVkOFAyZHI1QjhMVzNqV3lMd0JDYWVra0UtRWxpaGtvWEdCaFF1N0J4THZoWVRvZk1Db1k5UkFOcm1KNTgxQ1dFNWJHcXowYnFCRWVzang1ZzduUnlOekNjV3FpcHpTak8</guid></item><item><title>为较贫穷国家提供廉价的艾滋病毒预防注射器被誉为“结束”全球流行病的“真正机会” --《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/24/hiv-prevention-jab-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep-lenacapavir-120-poorer-countries-2027</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cheap supplies of a groundbreaking twice-yearly HIV prevention jab will be available in many poorer countries within two years, funders have promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lenacapavir will cost $40 (£30) a patient a year in 120 low- and middle-income countries from 2027, under two agreements with generic drug manufacturers announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year there were 1.3m new HIV infections globally and experts have said that lenacapavir, as a preventive drug or “pre-exposure prophylaxis” (PrEP), could have a transformative effect on that figure.

Though all the colony’s bats were tested for rabies (which requires euthanasia) and came back negative, health officials couldn’t say for certain that everyone was safe from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Wyoming Department of Health quickly jumped into action, partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other states’ health departments to track down guests who’d stayed in rooms with known bat encounters. That meant getting in touch with guests from over 230 reservations, who lived in 38 different states and seven countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation found that of the guests staying in the impacted rooms, less than 10 people, or just two groups of reservations, had a high enough risk to warrant getting the post-exposure vaccine series, Wyoming state public health veterinarian Emily Curren told SFGATE. “That was a huge relief,” Curren said. “Most people did it just to be on the safe side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 98% of people surveyed during the outreach investigation never saw a bat and were considered to have no or low risk of rabies exposure, according to Curren. “We were super thrilled that the vast majority of the people were not at risk,” she said. Outreach did turn up two visitors who had seen a bat and hadn’t already reported it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bat teeth are small enough to not cause a visible bite or draw blood, which is why treatment could be warranted even if a wound or scratch isn’t visible. Sleeping people may not know if they came into contact with a bat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for rabies to sicken a human, depending on where the person was bitten (which determines how long it takes the virus to reach the brain). The post-exposure vaccine series &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; a dose of human rabies immune globulin and four rabies vaccine doses over two weeks if the patient has never received a rabies vaccine before. The series protects those bitten by a rabid animal as long as the shots are completed before symptoms develop. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 100,000 Americans receive the shots after potential rabies exposures every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wyoming Department of Health, the National Park Service, park concessionaires and the CDC met this summer for a site visit of the lodge and other historic park properties. The buildings are difficult to bat-proof entirely, as the little brown creatures can squeeze through cracks that are a quarter-inch wide. “It’s crazy how small they can squish themselves down,” Curren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand Teton National Park is &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildlife-and-rabies.htm" data-link="native" class=""&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; to at least nine different species of bats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:05:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOLUxaSjZBdUxZcVdvT2Q2RWxGOVp5NDh3b2dmdEo4b09lTXc2XzRBcnJVdTZjeGtUQWJJcEM3NmNORHpEWUcxTVduLUhRbEFrZ3A2T0djdmdiRlpadldwYW9XXzNmQklwZEJXOG0tLTdxbmx4RlZZSThQbFBRSkdhS0JvZUhITld5dEU2U2RKeU9mNVhCZktoSUJWNnpRNHpBYWphWDMtdFo</guid></item><item><title>慈善机构达成一项有希望的交易，以扭转艾滋病毒感染的局面-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/health/hiv-treatment-shots-lenacapavir.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOdjVnNmxaRkFBeEtfa1I4UHlLNTBxQk1nNzdLS0U5UnN0V3JWVlJkem9tWFNScG5OQUl3S3ZUeW9zUGFsZ1JScWU1ZDdza3R1THhscGt3QkhBbjRjbG81aDRJbzg5aUtaOXUwcUQtZElUdkdsV2hPNW03Rl9CdDNGX2FHVUc</guid></item><item><title>治疗前列腺癌的选择比以往任何时候都多--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/well/live/prostate-cancer-treatment-explainer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNdHJ1VmF4V214MDF6ZGNwam9KZDBGVU5sSWM5WWtSbEt0UnhvM2xOb1VuaDQtbnNkTG5zc0JaT0hHNjFoT29GcW1zVzk2bURZY3A3c2RaR2U0eXJDcXBkV2FCUjRWLXNWOXZuR0lPcWwzMVBjcDdoeFVOWVpDbmo1TThOckRMOUdaZzN1NmVn</guid></item><item><title>接吻虫病可能在美国全年持续存在。这对路易斯安那州意味着什么？ - NOLA.com</title><link>https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/kissing-bug-disease-in-louisiana/article_9f15562a-e9e9-4e3f-a866-31fb6cbb1d79.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with Chagas is that it's a chronic disease that takes years to develop, someone could die without knowing they have it," said Dr. Norman Beatty, a clinician at the University of Florida who contributed to the CDC research and report.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite, and its symptoms, can remain dormant in the body from one year to three decades after infection. Chagas disease does not spread from person-to-person nor does it spread from casual contact with infected animals.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all kissing bugs carry the parasite that causes Chagas disease, T. cruzi, which is passed when the insects defecate. Scratching the bite or rubbing eyes can push the infected fecal material inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;"Most people find out they have Chagas disease when they give blood," said Aaron Ashbrook, an urban and peri-urban entomologist at Louisiana State University's AgCenter.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can be treated with two different medications benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both kill the parasite and are fully effective in curing Chagas if given earlyÂ â€” the acute phase lasts around two monthsÂ â€” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20presents%20in%20two,one%20eye%20(Roma%C3%B1a's%20sign)." target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of the medication diminishes, however, the longer a person has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases are not actively rising, the CDC said. However, raising Chagas disease to an endemic could "improve surveillance, research and public health responses" in the U.S., according to the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The longer a person is living with this chronic infection, the longer patients are going to receive permanent damage," Beatty said. "Why do words matter? A new endemic status could bring awareness that it exists, and that we need to screen people at risk and offer therapy, prevent development."&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs have been around for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC357047/" target="_blank"&gt;around 9,000 years old&lt;/a&gt;, according to a National Library of Medicine study, but are more common across Latin America and South America. Chagas disease is an endemic in 21 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 8 million people in the world have Chagas diseaseÂ â€” and around 288,000 people in the U.S.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also estimates that of the total Americans with Chagas, only 10,000 were infected inside the country. Most others contracted the disease in Latin America and then traveled or immigrated to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Still, kissing bugs have been found in 32 states, and there have been cases of local transmission in people in eight states: California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health does not actively monitor positive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Chagas champion, that's what I call myself," Beatty said. "I want to be an advocate for awareness to spread awareness of this disease. I want there to be more awareness, and data, on a national and state level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to look forÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of kissing bug in Louisiana: triatoma sanguisuga, triatoma lecticularia and triatoma gerstaeckeri.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs in Louisiana have a longer lead time for infection, Ashbrook said. A kissing bug in the state would need to be on the body for 30 minutes to defecate and infect the person.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for wildlife and other animals, even dogs, to be infected with Chagas disease from kissing bugs. These infected animals, however, cannot transfer the disease to humans.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can only get it if bitten by an infected kissing bug," Ashbrook said.Â &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs with Chagas disease are common in uninhabited buildings, like hunting cabins or cabins, as well asÂ wildlife rodent burrows, raccoon nests, armadillo burrows and structures for outdoor pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU's AgCenter has received many kissing bug inquiries in the last few weeks, according to Ashbrook, on how to handle the pesky creatures.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashbrook advises people who suspect they found a kissing bug to capture it in a bag, freeze it and give it to the LSU AgCenter.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want people to crush the bug," Ashbrook said. "That increases the risk of exposure. Freezing for a few days is better, and kills the bug without much mess."Â &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It's important, however, that people properly identify the bugs as they are very similar to assassin bugs, a beneficial insect in Louisiana.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kissing bugs tend to have pointier heads, Ashbrook said, while the assassin bugs are rounder at the top.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs are black or dark brown and have red, orange or yellow stripes on the edge of their bodies. They are just a little bigger than the size of a penny, can bite without being detected and are most active at night, according to Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an &lt;a href="/topic/emory-university"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iucbZA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The rate of NDM cases rose by 460 per cent, researchers said" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-123568"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The rate of NDM cases rose by 460 per cent, researchers said&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ nightmare bacteria ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69 per cent. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460 per cent, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, &lt;a href="/topic/new-york"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise.

   &lt;p&gt;If more and more young people are dying of colorectal cancer, why aren't we talking about it? Is it because we're too ashamed of our bodies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer are rising, especially for people under 50. But it's hard to raise awareness for a cancer that a lot of us find hard to talk about. In a &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/colorectal-colon-cancer-diagnosis-laurie-abraham.html" target="_blank"&gt;recent essay&lt;/a&gt; for The Cut, writer &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Laurie-Abraham/47098549" target="_blank"&gt;Laurie Abraham&lt;/a&gt; described her experience of colon cancer, which included a lot of embarrassment. Talking about your bowel movements is...not fun. Can you relate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, Brittany is joined by Laurie and &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kimmie-ng" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Director of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, to get into the cultural shame around how we talk about colon cancer - and how that extends to a lack of funding and research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow Brittany Luse on Instagram: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bmluse/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;@bmluse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For handpicked podcast recommendations every week, subscribe to NPR’s Pod Club newsletter at &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/pod-club" target="_blank"&gt;npr.org/podclub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="d756c368-e00e-4bf9-98f2-7cde243989b0"&gt;One of the best things you can do to stay healthy as you get older is to strength train. Regularly putting your muscles under stress with resistance—be that lifting weights or working with your bodyweight—keeps you stronger for longer and helps you to avoid some of the health risks that come with getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to James Klein, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lifetime.life/locations/va/gainesville.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.lifetime.life/locations/va/gainesville.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Life Time Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;, who told me why strength training is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="d756c368-e00e-4bf9-98f2-7cde243989b0-2"&gt;“Strength training is critical for overall health because it builds muscle mass, strengthens bones and enhances metabolic function, which collectively reduce the risk of chronic diseases like osteoporosis, diabetes and heart disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that by increasing our muscle strength and endurance, we can improve our joint stability, posture and balance, all of which lower the likelihood of injuries and falls, particularly as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular resistance exercise, such as the dumbbell workouts described, supports functional independence, promotes longevity and empowers individuals to perform daily activities with ease, making it a cornerstone of a vibrant, healthy lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein may be using heavy dumbbells to demonstrate the exercises, but you don’t have to! Choose a challenging weight, but one that allows you to complete all the reps with good form. Selecting the right weight is a fine art, so there’s nothing wrong with changing weights between exercises and even between sets. You can also perform the lunge and squat with just your bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB07DNYSJ8W%2Fref%3Dsxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1453745720559184836-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/FLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable/dp/B07DNYSJ8W/ref=sxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB07DNYSJ8W%2Fref%3Dsxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;weight bench&lt;/a&gt; for some of the upper-body exercises, and you should find one at your local gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7Y8vccVGbVGUKYPWBPaBhj" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7Y8vccVGbVGUKYPWBPaBhj slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-walking-lunge" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-walking-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

He adds that by holding a dumbbell at chest height you are encouraging an upright posture and deeper squat depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They primarily work the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings and core muscles, while also engaging the upper back for posture support. This movement is ideal for overall health as it improves hip mobility, trains multi-joint activation and helps prevent lower-back issues by reinforcing proper squat mechanics, making it a staple for progressive strength gains,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-dumbbell-shoulder-press" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-dumbbell-shoulder-press"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

			&lt;p&gt;Imbibing even the smallest amounts of booze can raise your risk of dementia, according to the largest combined observational and genetic study to date on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings counter &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.11.1405"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; showing that light-to-moderate drinking might protect against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the new study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol"&gt;cutting out drinking&lt;/a&gt; altogether may be the best way to minimize the risk of dementia later in life, with increasing levels of alcohol consumption matching an increasing likelihood of developing dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;of any kind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study findings support a detrimental effect of all types of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, with no evidence supporting the previously suggested protective effect of moderate drinking," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-no-safe-level-of-alcohol-consumption-us-surgeon-general-warns"&gt;There Is No Safe Level of Alcohol Consumption, US Surgeon General Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team began by looking at 559,559 adults in the UK and US, aged between 56 and 72 at the start of the study period. The participants filled out questionnaires on their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-night-of-drinking-affects-your-food-choices"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt;, and their health was monitored for up to 15 years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the research resulted in a classic U-shaped graph: non-drinkers and heavy drinkers were shown to have the highest risk of dementia. That fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16035"&gt;some earlier research&lt;/a&gt;, and appears to suggest that moderate drinking is associated with the lowest dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175229" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph.jpg" alt="Genetic disposition to drinking chart" class="wp-image-175229 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph-409x415.jpg 409w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175229" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A higher genetic predisposition to drinking was linked to a higher risk of dementia. (Topiwala et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ Evid. Based Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers argue that the protective effect of light drinking doesn't actually exist – that non-drinkers are often heavy drinkers who have quit, or who have cut down on booze because of the early effects of cognitive decline. In other words, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/moderate-drinking-is-not-good-for-you-after-all-study-finds"&gt;stats are skewed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find more evidence, the study also looked at genetic records for 2.4 million people, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; to analyze drinking in relation to dementia. The approach works by using a genetic predisposition to drinking rather than data on actual drinking habits – which in theory cuts out other factors, such as lifestyle or wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this part of the analysis, the U shape disappeared. The higher the predicted alcohol consumption, the higher &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;the dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, with no dip for light drinkers who enjoyed the occasional beer or glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halving the population prevalence of alcohol use disorder may reduce dementia cases by up to 16 percent, highlighting alcohol reduction as a potential strategy in dementia prevention policies," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some significant caveats to consider, which the researchers openly acknowledge. In the first part of the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-simple-strategy-that-works-to-reduce-alcohol-intake-scientists-say"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt; were self-reported by the participants, not scientifically observed, which can lead to inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the study, Mendelian randomization is a useful tool, but relies on linking genetic data to the likelihood of a trait – in this case, that someone drinks. It's not a direct record of alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, given the extensive scope of the research and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-until-you-pass-out-linked-to-doubled-risk-of-dementia-giant-study-reveals"&gt;multiple previous studies&lt;/a&gt; that it adds to, it's solid evidence that as we drink more, the chances of cognitive decline and dementia in later life go up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/even-light-drinking-could-increase-risk-dementia-risk-large-study-suggests"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy gut is essential for digestion and supporting many of the body's systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ginger tea promotes gut health by helping reduce inflammation, relieve nausea and ease stomach pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other ways to improve gut health include eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated and managing stress. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a healthy gut not only aids in digestion and nutrient absorption, but also supports many other parts of the body, including your immune system, brain, skin, heart and more. As the extensive health benefits have come to light in recent years, many people are looking to improve the health of their microbiomes. But contrary to what you might think, you don’t need to take an expensive supplement to support a healthy gut. In fact, certain drinks you may already have at home can make a big difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there are many teas that offer benefits for gut health—including peppermint, chamomile and fennel—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ginger-tea-benefits-8603959" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger tea&lt;/a&gt; stands out as one of the best. Made from the root of the ginger plant, it's a popular natural remedy used for many health ailments. Its unique combination of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and digestive-aiding properties makes it exceptionally effective at helping to soothe various digestive issues.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://vidanutritionconsulting.com/about-us/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Crystal Orozco, RD&lt;/a&gt;, notes “Ginger tea is great for when you are having digestive issues, especially frequent stomachaches, bloating and nausea.” It helps relieve nausea by blocking serotonin receptors in the gut that trigger the vomiting reflex. The natural compounds in ginger, like gingerols, work to ease queasiness, which can also help you feel better. Orozco notes, “As a dietitian who has always struggled with gut issues, ginger tea is one of my go-to remedies. I always recommend a soothing ginger tea with lemon and honey to help ease stomach pain and discomfort.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger has been recognized for its therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly for managing conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and indigestion. Research has shown that ginger can help reduce the production of stomach acid, which may help decrease symptoms of GERD.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, ginger may also ease upper abdominal cramping, bloating and discomfort associated with indigestion.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Over time, it can damage the digestive tract, which may increase the risk of conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-leaky-gut-8637811" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;leaky gut syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.thirdeyenourishment.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Keelin Murphy, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, “The bioactive ingredient [in ginger]—gingerol—is a powerful antioxidant that can help alleviate intestinal inflammation.” This can help calm irritation and swelling in the gut lining, which may prevent further damage. Murphy, a sports dietitian, notes, “I recommend ginger tea to my athletes as a way to alleviate exercise-induced gut issues.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While ginger tea offers numerous benefits for gut health, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. To truly nurture a healthy digestive system, it’s important to adopt a holistic approach that incorporates various lifestyle practices. Here are some additional strategies to support and maintain optimal gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Balanced Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins to provide fiber that supports a healthy gut microbiome. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is essential for regular bowel movements, feeding beneficial gut bacteria and helping to maintain a healthy balance of microbes in the digestive system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking plenty of water aids digestion and helps maintain the balance of good bacteria in your gut. Water can also help soften stool, making it easier to pass. Staying hydrated also supports the mucosal lining of the intestines, which aids in nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include Probiotics and Prebiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented foods contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, while garlic, onions and bananas are good sources of prebiotics. Together, they support a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: Some stress in life is inevitable, but consistently high stress levels can negatively impact your gut health. Over time, this can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;increase chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that may disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, increasing gut permeability and altering digestive function. Stress hormones like cortisol can affect gut motility and the integrity of the gut lining. Practices such as mindfulness, meditation and regular physical activity can help reduce stress and support a healthy gut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a healthy gut is crucial not only for digestion and nutrient absorption, but also for overall well-being, impacting a variety of bodily processes. Among the array of teas that support gut health, ginger tea emerges as a standout, renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to alleviate digestive discomfort. This tea has been shown to reduce nausea, calm indigestion, relieve constipation and decrease inflammation. If you are not a tea-drinker, you can also support your microbiome through a variety-filled diet rich in probiotics and prebiotics, adequate hydration and stress management. The best way to nurture a healthy gut is to take a holistic and well-rounded approach.

			&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-has-new-guidelines-for-high-blood-pressure-heres-what-that-means"&gt;US Has New Guidelines For High Blood Pressure. Here's What That Means.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation US asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;"systolic" and the "diastolic" pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of "prehypertension," which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mercury" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="72978" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having "elevated blood pressure" if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise, and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient's overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg" alt="wine poured into a glass" class="wp-image-175247 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol is one way to keep blood pressure down. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFFHBns0U/"&gt;NatashaPhoto/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175248" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-175248 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Regular exercise each week can help blood pressure drop.

This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263507/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I was under the mistaken impression that Health Secretary Worm-Brain’s restrictions on covid vaccinations were already in place. However, when I went to a drug store today for my annual flu shot, I asked if covid shots were still available, and, to my surprise, they were! So I got the newest covid shot in addition to a current flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, RFK Jr. plans to limit access to covid vaccinations to people 65 and over; and to those with serious health conditions. I don’t know how soon it will be when the baseless new vaccine restrictions will be implemented; and implementation might vary from state to state; even though the whole idea of limiting vaccine access is coming from the federal level, via Mr. Worm-Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are able to do so, you ought to get a covid vaccination now! If you’ve already had one fairly recently and you’re unsure if you’re due for an update, err on the side of caution and get one! No one has ever overdosed on vaccinations. And thanks to Health Secretary Worm-Brain, we might no longer have the luxury of waiting a while for our next covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;“You have certain groups — the Amish, for example — that have essentially no autism,” &lt;a href="https://people.com/trump-rfk-jr-says-tylenol-causes-autism-11814830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump with trademark certainty yesterday. Stood next to his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he suggested that Amish people have low levels of autism because Amish women don’t take paracetamol (sold as Tylenol in the US) during pregnancy. Famously, they also don’t spend their days glued to screens; they’re too busy churning butter, raising barns and producing dozens of children. But Trump chose to point the finger at painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinicians across the world scrambled to rebut him. In Britain, Health Secretary Wes Streeting replied, “I trust doctors over President Trump.” It’s easy to be smug, but whatever the driver, Trump is right about one thing: autism figures are rocketing. A generation ago, the condition was rare. By 2000, one in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 eight-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; in the US had a diagnosis; by 2022, it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html"&gt;one in 31&lt;/a&gt;. The UK is following the same pattern. Diagnoses rose 787% between &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;1998 and 2018,&lt;/a&gt; and the BMA now estimates one in 100 British children &lt;a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/improving-the-health-of-specific-groups/autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has an ASD label.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a narrow category, “autism spectrum disorder” has metastasised into a fashionable identity. The label now stretches from children who will never speak or live independently to tech titans like Elon Musk. Now that the stigma has ebbed away, pushy middle-class parents angle for diagnoses to give their offspring an educational edge, while students at elite universities &lt;a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/march-2025/oxford-on-the-spectrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-identify&lt;/a&gt; as autistic for both extra exam time and the warm glow of victimhood. Meanwhile, those with the most profound needs — whose families are exhausted by round-the-clock care — are increasingly drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics have begun to notice. Professor Ginny Russell of Exeter University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that ever-wider criteria, often based on self-description rather than clinical observation, risk a situation where “maybe everyone is categorised as neurodiverse”. “As awareness and diagnoses increase, those with less severe symptoms come forward with their own stories of how autism affects them,” Russell says. “The diagnostic criteria is widened to take these accounts on board, which loops back again to another increase in diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not simply a medical question but a cultural one: a disorder once marked by silence and incapacity has become a lazy shorthand for genius. Yet diagnostic creep can only explain part of the phenomenon. Something else is happening to children. As evolutionary biologist Heather Heying writes in &lt;i&gt;A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century,&lt;/i&gt; the “uptick in diagnoses on the autism spectrum” may be “related to the number of children who were raised staring into screens.” “Do not let inanimate objects babysit your children,” Heying commands, “Those seemingly alive creatures, which cannot and therefore will not respond to a child’s looks or gestures or questions, send the message to the developing brain that the world is not an emotionally responsive place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, toddlers pacified by&lt;em&gt; Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; on repeat learn that the world does not answer back. Reduced eye contact, poor reciprocity, repetitive behaviours: the classic signifiers of autism can also be the hallmarks of children’s behaviour when raised on screens. If we wanted to manufacture a generation displaying autistic-like traits, we could hardly have done better than to outsource parenting to iPads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author and psychotherapist Joe Burgo, who works with teenagers who identify as trans, sees the same detachment. Patients who “spend countless hours online in virtual interactions, playing video games, and social media scrolling,” he tells me, become unmoored. “This leads to a dissociated experience of being in your head rather than down in your body where you might notice your feeling states. This dissociation is what we’re seeing rather than true ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in diagnoses, then, is likely twofold: ever-expanding criteria and an environment that fosters autistic mimicry. Tackling it will require more than scolding expectant mothers for taking paracetamol. It means resisting the pathologisation of every quirk, and it means putting down our phones — parents as well as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Trump may have been half-right. For all their butter-churning and barn-raising, the Amish really might be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn’t differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm2025-113913" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed how certain genes linked to alcohol might impact how liquor consumption affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The genetic analyses results (showed) that even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk,” said lead study author Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is the largest study on the topic, and the combination of observational and genetic analyses was key,” Topiwala said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or “spurious” variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person’s entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,” said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer’s it often depends on “when” and “how” people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you drink may impact how alcohol affects your body, according to neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson. - skynesher/E+/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;An emerging link between alcohol and dementia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC-2B-2FcGjIObrNSpDAzLgn3dTfioeF6ZLIGlJnAtzhla-2FMB-b5y_sGhGCVpwFe-2F7omibEFFkS2OLk-2BdOXuEASIRdx2x8JgEFQyU0wnkVnFTYr98WHiItd5mAU-2BAp3fGMKwThCzfas-2BIy2J5J2TQRaHk0rY-2BYi8gC68WDt7KNqJGjf671sFq0CreRdLntWVvjhjzWnR4ZK1KbkuSYkyDNH1Oo-2BB3-2FMU1s5Fa3yqYUcB7ngOTRt7Pwv0xvkH0e8v4Q-2BzkUoEa5sYp2n-2BhStbxC8ArvgXgFTf05LkBWEQ4Y0QMkScZSHhM6jcMcBG9TWmNu0OJWyPMSYYPjWljvzcDV-2BLnsODoLlv337JC7gInsDHAyCJ-2BlO0xiPr5XulFb8Z7Bznn7JViXW4ZFAANpA0dyr-2FGBsN9AheU-3D&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Csandee.lamotte%40cnn.com%7Ca3cadbb3bde44fc3fd1e08ddf77ca15d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638938836851695641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=MeoB4Om0KaUrNG4480l1FFE2glKRN59KJ2ee8xfgCHw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Million Veteran Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt;, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In that observational part of the study, people provided self-reports of how much they drank, and researchers compared alcohol consumption with their risk of developing dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),” said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Interestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,” said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher genetic risk was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is a 15% higher dementia risk for 3 drinks per week compared to 1 drink per week across life,” Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,” Spires-Jones said. “But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are a dependable &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7677520/health-benefits-of-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of protein&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With so many benefits, it’s no wonder eggs are a popular breakfast food. Still, it’s easy to get into an egg rut, cooking up the same basic scramble every morning. We’re taking our current egg inspiration from the late Queen of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth II. Turns out, Queen Elizabeth liked to add two simple ingredients to her scrambled eggs, and they make a huge difference flavor-wise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lisa Steele, chicken-keeping expert, host of CreateTV’s &lt;em&gt;Welcome to my Farm&lt;/em&gt;, and food blogger at &lt;a href="https://www.fresheggsdaily.blog" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fresh Eggs Daily&lt;/a&gt;, says Queen Elizabeth had a very specific way she liked to eat her eggs. “A favorite [way of making eggs] of mine is Queen Elizabeth's secret to scrambled eggs,” Steele tells EatingWell. “She reportedly loved adding a dusting of nutmeg and some lemon zest to her eggs. It sounds odd, but it's actually a nice combination.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/19/queens-scrambled-eggs-recipe-had-2-very-unusual-ingredients/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.superchargedfood.com/blog/the-queens-favourite-scrambled-eggs-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lee Holmes&lt;/a&gt; claims to have received the Queen’s scrambled egg recipe from a friend who cooked for Elizabeth years ago. While Queen Elizabeth died in 2022, her two-ingredient addition to a classic breakfast dish lives on in people like Steele, who said it’s worth trying for yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I have had fried eggs with lemon slices before, and I love the freshness a bit of citrus brings to eggs,” Steele explained. “Eggs can be a bit flat and neutral in flavor, so the lemon juice really wakes them up. In this case, the freshly-zested lemon peel does the same. It adds an unexpected pop of brightness, which, let's face it, we can all use first thing in the morning.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A little &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chef-carla-hall-says-you-re-juicing-your-citrus-wrong-8677432" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;citrus can be a great way&lt;/a&gt; to freshen up your breakfast plate—that's why we love recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-poppyseed-overnight-oats-11790966" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon Poppyseed Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259625/carrot-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Carrot Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The nutmeg,” Steele added, “adds a nice, smooth warmth which is a great balance to the acidic zest. I actually love nutmeg in other savory dishes like macaroni and cheese and quiches, as well as sweet breads, scones or muffins, so adding it to scrambled eggs makes perfect sense.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I tried the Queen’s scrambled egg recipe for myself and agree with Steele: Adding some zested lemon and a sprinkle of nutmeg to my normal morning scrambled egg recipe boosted the flavor quite a bit. The tart acidity of the lemon made the eggs taste lighter and brighter, and the nutmeg added a cozy, savory flavor that seemed comforting and perfect for fall.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make Queen Elizabeth’s egg recipe, I followed the instructions shared on Lee Holmes’ blog. I whisked three eggs with 1 tablespoon of milk in a bowl and seasoned the mixture with salt. Then I heated 1 tablespoon of butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. When the butter was melted, I added the egg mixture to the pan and turned the heat down to low, occasionally moving them around in the pan with a spatula until nearly set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the eggs were just about cooked through, I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and a sprinkle of nutmeg, along with a bit more salt, and gave them one final move around the pan with my spatula to combine. Served with some fresh chives from my herb garden, the dish looked beautiful and tasted great: truly a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/princess-diana-overnight-oats-11798752" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;breakfast fit for a queen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Together the lemon and nutmeg... play off each other in a really flavorful way,” Steele said of the dish’s flavor profile. "Each bite of the scrambled eggs gives your tongue a pop of the zest and then the nutty notes of nutmeg—an unconventional pairing that works so well.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're looking for a way to upgrade your go-to breakfast, reach for a little citrus and spice for your next scramble. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised.

Garbanzo walked toward the camera with those adorable tiny paws and little kitten face, looking so small a strong wind could blow him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fast forward to five months later and Garbanzo was taking up half a laundry basket with his much-bigger body. At a full six months old, the Maine Coon had huge paws as well as a fluffy and lush coat. The little kitten face developed into a strong adult countenance. Rather than clumsily walking like an toddler, Garbanzo had a bit of a confident strut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference from one to six months was quite remarkable and illustrated how the feline is growing up into a gorgeous and healthy adult cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Kitten Development From 1 to 6 Months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Around the one-month mark, kittens have already experienced substantial physical &lt;a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dcc541ee-8c02-4e51-9d7c-f8fb0cd9cefd&amp;amp;siteId=us-y4p&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=333ef326-e9f1-3214-87af-ab49a2c89f5a&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=thevets&amp;amp;linkText=development&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RoZXZldHMuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlcy9wZXQtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUva2l0dGVuLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXN0YWdlcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMzM2VmMzI2LWU5ZjEtMzIxNC04N2FmLWFiNDlhMmM4OWY1YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aGV2ZXRzLmNvbS9yZXNvdXJjZXMvcGV0LWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlL2tpdHRlbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1zdGFnZXMvIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAARhKkTMdWr9qEbLhStF0A43Y4_g4WoXoHI8pPHXgMkoG&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fthevets.com%2Fresources%2Fpet-health-care%2Fkitten-development-stages%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:thevets;elmt:" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:development;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:thevets;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and become more independent at this stage.

Kittens are more playful and curious after four weeks, and can start solid food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From six to eight weeks, kittens should have all their baby teeth. Their adult eye color will begin to emerge, and their vision and hearing are fully developed. Weaning is usually completed at eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Coordination and agility skills are fully matured at eight to 12 weeks, and bonding with humans during this phase is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/maine-coon-kitten-discovers-milk-bowl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Maine Coon Kitten's Mustache Face After 'Discovering the Milk Bowl' Is Everything;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Maine Coon Kitten's Mustache Face After 'Discovering the Milk Bowl' Is Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At six months, your feline is considered a full-fledged teenager.

&lt;p&gt;Most of the medical community once looked to an influential federal vaccine panel for guidance on immunizations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the discussions and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine panel veered from scientific consensus last week — and toward the vaccine-skeptical beliefs of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — many experts are looking elsewhere.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It used to be that the CDC was the No. 1 public health agency in this world,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “That’s not true anymore.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once a panel full of leading experts in epidemiology, vaccine research and statistics has been replaced by Kennedy, for the most part, with figures who have doubted core public health tenets and spread misinformation, according to Offit.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recommended against a &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/health-now/experts-help-explain-new-federal-vaccine-guidelines-for-childhood-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/health-now/experts-help-explain-new-federal-vaccine-guidelines-for-childhood-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-pharmacy-board-broadens-access-to-covid-19-shots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;discouraged covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; for healthy individuals and &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/the-public-in-jeopardy-experts-react-to-rfk-jr-s-cancellation-of-vaccine-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;defunded research into the technology&lt;/a&gt; that can quickly produce new vaccines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To varying degrees, these actions fly in the face of broadly held views in health care, prompting medical organizations to issue independent guidance and muddying the waters on how providers should prescribe and give treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Monday, for instance, explicitly &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-wary-of-federal-guidance-turns-to-medical-groups-for-vaccine-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called on doctors&lt;/a&gt; to turn to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for vaccine guidance — not federal authorities.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those recommendations typically align with federal recommendations, but not entirely at this point,” Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen told TribLive on Tuesday. “That is exactly the reason we put out our guidance: to try to guide people to trusted, evidence-based sources.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘It wasn’t good for anybody’s health’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines haven’t been the only area of interest for federal health officials.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, President Donald Trump connected Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism in children. He said the Food and Drug Administration would begin notifying doctors that acetaminophen, Tylenol’s active ingredient, “can be associated” with an increased risk of autism — despite not providing a reason for the new recommendation.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement left some of the medical community aghast.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the single most irresponsible and dangerous press conference regarding public health in presidential history,” Offit said. “It wasn’t good for anybody’s health.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have repeatedly examined a possible link between Tylenol and autism and found an association, according to Devon Ramaeker, division director of maternal-fetal medicine at Allegheny Health Network’s Women’s Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the over-the-counter pain reliever causes developmental conditions, she said, noting that autism stems from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that autism is likely a very complex diagnosis that has a lot of potential reasons it may occur,” she said. “And simplifying it down to a single cause, risk factor or exposure is oversimplifying the diagnosis.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could definitely lead to adverse outcomes, according to Ramaeker, is a pregnant woman deciding to “tough it out” when they have a fever, as Trump suggested, rather than taking Tylenol. Untreated fevers in pregnant women bring a higher risk of birth defects during the first trimester, including a spinal cord condition that can cause severe disability.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit put it this way: “All the data is on the side of fever is bad for you in the first trimester, and Tylenol doesn’t increase your incidence of autism.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews of Monday’s news conference weren’t all bad.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Carosso, an autism specialist with multiple offices in Southwestern Pennsylvania, said Trump and Kennedy are right to frame rising autism diagnoses as a crisis.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a tremendous travesty,” he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Carosso sees rising cases of autism, other medical experts see a more robust and inclusive diagnostic framework that better recognizes the condition in women and minority groups.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carosso isn’t sure whether the Tylenol connection is legitimate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting to the bottom of this will be a challenge, in his view, “because it comes from the Trump administration, (so) it’s going to be immediately refuted” by a large swath of medical experts.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘United the medical and scientific community’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a Pittsburgh-based infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he reads the data himself to determine what is going on in terms of vaccines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would not trust anything that Kennedy has control over,” Adalja said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes several key authorities, including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, all of which dictate the country’s health guidelines and policies.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some states are trying to fill the void as confidence in federal guidance wanes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania announced Thursday it had joined Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York State, Rhode Island and New York City to launch the &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-joins-northeast-state-health-coalition-as-cdc-shakeups-concern-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northeast Public Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-joins-northeast-state-health-coalition-as-cdc-shakeups-concern-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition will “protect the health, safety and well-being of all residents by providing information based on science, data, and evidence, while working to ensure equitable access to vaccines, medications and services,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/newsroom/launch-northeast-public-health-collaborative" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; for the state.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization held its first meeting in August, where it started identifying opportunities to work together on public health emergency preparedness and response as well as vaccine schedules.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit called Monday’s news conference a jolt for some within the medical establishment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really united the medical and scientific community,” Offit said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Confusion and repercussions&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting guidelines have left patients and doctors with conflicting information.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Disease Society of America and states have created their own expert advisory bodies to make recommendations that they think are based on good data and are therefore good practices — the problem is it’s become fragmented. So people are unclear what exactly to look at,” Offit said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Offit, the answer is for doctors to look to guidance from their corresponding medical association. For example, pediatricians should abide by American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusion has also led doctors to be unsure about what insurance companies will cover, he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Health Department said residents will continue to get insurance coverage for shots recommended by the CDC as of last year. It’s not clear when insurers might change vaccine coverage, if they desired.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such an uncertain landscape, patients are best served consulting medical professionals, according to Ramaeker.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really think that for patients this can be a confusing time, and I think they need to rely on their medical providers to make informed decisions for them, in conjunction with them,” Ramaeker said.

&lt;/p&gt;

The results did not paint a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The mice, especially the older ones, started to show behavioral changes eerily similar to dementia. The plastic particles crossed the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation in the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jaime Ross, the study's lead author, told the Post she was alarmed by how quickly the changes took place, saying: "I'm still really surprised by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This isn't just an isolated finding. The concern is that these plastic particles could be an environmental trigger for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Research Communications found that when mice with a high-risk gene for Alzheimer's, APOE4, were exposed to microplastics, they showed significant cognitive and behavioral changes that weren't seen in mice without the gene. This suggests that microplastics could interact with genetic predispositions to accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is made worse by daily exposure. We're constantly in contact with plastics, and another study has raised concerns about cytotoxicity from microplastics, especially from food containers that are heated or cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the science is alarming, the good news is that people are tackling this problem from every angle. It starts with simple choices, and there's a lot of &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helpful information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;helpful information&lt;/a&gt; available on how to use less plastic in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Innovation is also providing hope. To get these particles out of our environment, researchers have developed a new kind of filter designed to catch even the smallest bits of plastic that usually slip through water treatment systems. For plastics already in our bodies, scientists have discovered a promising new way to filter microplastics out of human blood using a method similar to dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the fight to protect our health, another study found that powerful antioxidants found in many fruits and flowers can counteract some of the dangerous effects that microplastic exposure can have on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the link between microplastics and cognitive decline is deeply concerning, emerging scientific breakthroughs in filtering our water, cleansing our bodies, and using natural compounds to protect our health offer a hopeful path forward in tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec7QW0GpshZ5tm1o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNUGZDTHp6YW1rNHBPSmU5cllIMkJkOWhqWUpCbzRnUzNWXzJBQ01iR3VWTkRHMGgweU41cnFiWEdkVVEydG9JOGlDQmJqc2J0cEVnOTNuNmwzMFo5eGt1MTRBczk5VDAzTldPNldkOTdWM1JnenFCYkNZQzRVR0R3aFJiS2c3Z3U5MWdDR0s5MWUxWlpjSzYtWTY1TXNqQQ</guid></item><item><title>受影响的寡妇在他们最喜欢的海滩的小牛水中划桨后，因食肉细菌而失去了丈夫-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15127087/Virginia-Beach-vibrio-bacteria-infection-dead-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

'So its just so sad that the best place that we had is where he got sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days after the couple's trip to the beach, D'Arcy noticed a purple stripe on her husband's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The husband and wife sent his blood for testing, but by the time the test came back positive for vibrio another three days later, the infection had already spread across both his legs, causing severe damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which D'Arcy believes contributed to the rapid spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors determined that the only way to save Derek was by amputating his legs to stop the infection from spreading. Sadly, they didn't act quickly enough and just 12 hours after the surgery, the vibrio bacteria had spread Derek's chest, hands and head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that point, 'we knew we lost the fight,' D'Arcy said. Her husband would die around a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach where the husband was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria that would take his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Virginia Beach (pictured) was the couple's 'absolute favorite place to go'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vibrio infections are surprisingly common, and experts say one in five people who are infected will die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The widow hopes her story can serve as a warning to others about how quickly a person can die to the aggressive, flesh-eating bacteria and that awareness can save another family from experiencing a similar tragic and unexpected loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic doctors say vibrio is more common than people think, especially in the warmer months of May through October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections happen fairly often.  Most people survive but symptoms are very painful and many sufferers must face having limbs amputated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14983485/Deadly-flesh-eating-bacteria-spread-beaches-cases-surge-terrifying-rise.html"&gt;cases of vibrio infection rose into the double digits&lt;/a&gt; along the Gulf Coast and further up Atlantic Coast.  Experts believe the rising infections are caused by warming waters as the bacteria thrives in waters between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15065795/florida-mom-death-flesh-eating-bacteria-beach.html"&gt;a mother was left fighting for her life and almost lost her leg&lt;/a&gt; after contracting vibrio when she swam at Quietwater Beach in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also earlier this month,&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15056609/Vibrio-vulnificus-flesh-eating-bacteria-florida.html"&gt; a father contracted a vibrio infection after a fishing trip&lt;/a&gt;, which caused serious swelling and a burning sensation in his foot and ankle. It took three surgeries for doctors to stop the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in five people who are infected with vibrio will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="333" data-end="597"&gt;We live in a world where women are praised for being “strong” and “resilient.” On the outside, it looks like they’ve got it together—juggling careers, families, friendships, and everything in between. But here’s the truth: strength can sometimes mask exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="599" data-end="822"&gt;I’ve seen it in my own circles—women smiling through clenched teeth, showing up for everyone else while quietly running on empty. And maybe you’ve felt it yourself: that tug between appearing fine and actually being okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="824" data-end="1009"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always announce itself with a dramatic breakdown. More often, it slips in quietly, disguised as everyday habits and coping strategies. That’s why it’s so easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;If you’ve been wondering whether you—or someone you love—might be silently struggling, here are nine subtle signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1150" data-end="1181"&gt;1. She laughs everything off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1183" data-end="1415"&gt;Humor can be a brilliant coping tool. It allows us to soften the heaviness of life and connect with others. But when every struggle is brushed aside with a joke or a quick laugh, it may be less about joy and more about deflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1417" data-end="1625"&gt;I once caught myself laughing while telling a friend, “Oh, I barely slept all week, but who needs rest, right?” The truth was, I was completely depleted. That kind of humor isn’t lighthearted—it’s a shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1627" data-end="1964"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.peacheycounselling.ca/blog/the-mental-health-effects-of-masking-how-you-feel?.com"&gt;“masking,”&lt;/a&gt; and it often prevents deeper conversations. Friends and coworkers hear the joke and move on, never realizing there’s pain beneath the surface. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice the humor doesn’t quite land as joy—it lands as avoidance. And avoidance is one of burnout’s favorite hiding spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1971" data-end="2000"&gt;2. She’s always “too busy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2002" data-end="2157"&gt;Ever notice how some women keep their calendars packed to the brim? Work meetings, social gatherings, errands, volunteer work—anything to stay in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2159" data-end="2412"&gt;On the surface, it looks like ambition. But sometimes busyness is just burnout in disguise. When you’re constantly running from one task to another, there’s no space left to sit with uncomfortable feelings. Busyness becomes a distraction from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2414" data-end="2759"&gt;As Rudá Iandê notes in &lt;em data-start="2437" data-end="2500"&gt;&lt;a class="decorated-link" href="https://thevessel.io/laughing-in-the-face-of-chaos-book/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="2438" data-end="2499"&gt;Laughing in the Face of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “the more we try to escape or numb the chaos within, the more powerful the currents become.” His words hit me hard because I used to fill every spare hour just to avoid slowing down. Stillness can feel scary when your emotions are screaming for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2761" data-end="2931"&gt;Here’s the paradox: the very thing that looks like high functioning is often a sign that someone is hanging on by a thread. She’s not thriving—she’s outrunning herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2938" data-end="2985"&gt;3. Her sleep patterns are all over the place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3165"&gt;Sleep is often the first casualty of burnout. She may collapse into bed early but wake at 3 a.m. with racing thoughts. Or she may stay up late scrolling, dreading the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3349"&gt;Sleep disruption doesn’t just mean feeling groggy in the morning. It means her nervous system is stuck in overdrive. Even when her body begs for rest, her mind refuses to shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3351" data-end="3545"&gt;I’ve been there—lying in bed, exhausted but wired, rehearsing tomorrow’s to-do list over and over. For women pretending to be fine, poor sleep becomes the quiet evidence that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3547" data-end="3778"&gt;Research consistently &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e012816?.com"&gt;links burnout to insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and left unchecked, it creates a vicious cycle. The less she sleeps, the more drained she becomes—and the harder it gets to admit she’s struggling. Burnout thrives in that silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3785" data-end="3823"&gt;4. She avoids talking about herself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3825" data-end="4004"&gt;Have you ever noticed how some women are brilliant at steering the spotlight away from themselves? Ask how they’re doing and suddenly you’re talking about your own life instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4006" data-end="4212"&gt;This isn’t just politeness. It’s self-protection. Talking about herself might open the door to emotions she’s not ready to face. So she avoids vulnerability and instead turns the conversation back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4214" data-end="4415"&gt;It’s easy to mistake this for being “selfless” or “a great listener.” But if you scratch beneath the surface, it’s often a way of hiding. Pretending to be “fine” feels safer than admitting she’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4417" data-end="4558"&gt;This is one of the trickiest signs because it often looks like strength. But avoidance, in this case, is exhaustion wearing a polite smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4565" data-end="4598"&gt;5. She downplays her struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4784"&gt;A woman might casually mention, “I’ve just been a little tired lately,” when in reality she’s hanging on by a thread. Or she might frame serious stress as “just one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="5048"&gt;This isn’t denial—it’s survival. Admitting the full weight of her exhaustion feels overwhelming, so she minimizes it. Unfortunately, the more she downplays, the more isolated she becomes. Others assume she doesn’t need help, and the cycle of silence continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5050" data-end="5363"&gt;This is where Rudá Iandê’s insight rings true: “When we let go of the need to be perfect, we free ourselves to live fully—embracing the mess, complexity, and richness of a life that's delightfully real.” I’ve noticed how often women feel pressure to be “low-maintenance,” as though asking for support is a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5365" data-end="5438"&gt;But constant minimization is not strength—it’s a quiet cry for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5445" data-end="5478"&gt;6. Her body carries the weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5480" data-end="5617"&gt;Burnout rarely stays in the mind. It makes its home in the body: tension headaches, tight shoulders, stomach issues, unexplained aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5619" data-end="5799"&gt;I once went through months of stress that showed up as constant migraines. It took me ages to realize my body was trying to tell me what my mouth wouldn’t say: “You’re not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;Experts in somatic psychology emphasize that our bodies speak for us when we won’t. A woman insisting she’s fine while constantly battling physical symptoms isn’t lying—she may genuinely not connect the dots yet. But the body rarely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;A recent Swedish study found that people with high burnout &lt;a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A1742868/FULLTEXT01.pdf?.com"&gt;report many somatic symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—headaches, back pain, stomach problems, trouble sleeping—far more often than people without burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6043" data-end="6195"&gt;When physical pain becomes routine and excuses like “just stress” or “nothing serious” get repeated, it’s worth asking whether burnout has taken root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6202" data-end="6230"&gt;7. She withdraws socially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6452"&gt;On paper, she’s still present—she shows up at gatherings, sends birthday texts, maybe even posts on social media. But her engagement is surface-level. Conversations feel flat. She’s there, but she’s not &lt;em data-start="6435" data-end="6443"&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6616"&gt;Emotional burnout can make even lighthearted interactions feel draining. So while she might maintain appearances, she may quietly dread every social obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6618" data-end="6759"&gt;The irony? Many women fear that pulling back entirely will “let people down.” So they perform presence while secretly longing for solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6761" data-end="6915"&gt;Withdrawal doesn’t always look like disappearing. Sometimes it looks like her being “fine” in public and collapsing in private the moment she gets home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6922" data-end="6955"&gt;8. She relies on small escapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6957" data-end="7140"&gt;Wine at night. Endless streaming binges. Scrolling until her eyes blur. None of these things are inherently bad. But when they become daily rituals, it often signals deeper fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7142" data-end="7291"&gt;As one therapist explained in a seminar I attended, avoidance often masquerades as relaxation. What looks like “self-care” may actually be numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7293" data-end="7461"&gt;When the coping strategies pile up—snacks, wine, social media, shopping—it’s not indulgence. It’s a quiet attempt to silence the exhaustion she doesn’t want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7463" data-end="7656"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always scream—it whispers through little habits that add up over time. Pay attention to what she reaches for at the end of the day. It’s often the clue to what she’s avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7663" data-end="7695"&gt;9. She’s overly accommodating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7850"&gt;Have you met women who always say yes, always bend, always prioritize others? From the outside, it looks generous. But inside, it can feel suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7852" data-end="8062"&gt;I’ve been there myself—saying yes to everyone else while my own needs went unmet. What I learned, painfully, is that people-pleasing often stems from emotional exhaustion. It’s easier to comply than to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8064" data-end="8317"&gt;As Iandê reminds us, “Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life’s challenges.” A woman constantly saying yes isn’t thriving—she’s running on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8319" data-end="8476"&gt;Over-accommodation may look like compassion, but in reality, it’s a signal she’s too tired to hold boundaries. And boundaries are what keep burnout at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8483" data-end="8500"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8502" data-end="8661"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always look like collapse. Sometimes it looks like a woman smiling, joking, and assuring everyone she’s fine—while quietly unraveling inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8663" data-end="8827"&gt;The danger in ignoring these signs is that burnout compounds. The longer it goes unacknowledged, the harder it is to recover. That’s why awareness is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8829" data-end="8978"&gt;If you see yourself in these patterns, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Burnout is not a personal failing—it’s a human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8980" data-end="9209"&gt;Start small. Rest without guilt. Speak honestly, even if your voice shakes. And most importantly, remember this: you don’t have to keep pretending you’re fine. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to admit that you’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume-based pasta is the top choice — made from chickpeas, lentils, black beans, or peas, it offers far more fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals than traditional wheat pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition labels matter — experts recommend looking for pasta with at least 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving, plus added nutrients like iron for a more filling and balanced option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taste and use are versatile — chickpea pasta is closest to regular pasta in flavor, while lentil and black bean versions are earthier; all work well in traditional pasta dishes, especially when paired with vegetables and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-shelf-stable-foods-11740097" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pantry staples&lt;/a&gt; go, you can’t go wrong with dried pasta. The ingredient is a base for countless dishes, from classic &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/shellfish-spaghetti-8410404" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Shellfish Spaghetti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/lemony-linguine-with-olives-and-feta-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemony Linguine With Olives and Feta&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional pasta also mainly consists of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an easy source of energy. The drawback? Refined carbs are digested quickly, so you might feel hungry soon after eating pasta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, you may be looking for a “healthier” pasta with a greater variety of nutrients. To help support your search, we asked three registered dietitians to recommend the healthiest type of pasta you can buy, plus what to look for when shopping for pasta.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-dried-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in Dried Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with other foods, all types of pasta can be included in a balanced diet, and there’s no harm in enjoying traditional varieties. The “healthiest” type also depends on your goals and needs, per registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD.

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But generally, if you’re looking for the most nutrient-dense option, there are some things to consider. “If nutrition is a priority, compare &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;‘nutrition facts’ labels&lt;/a&gt; to see which pasta contains more important nutrients to distinguish the ‘healthier’ option,” suggests registered dietitian Connie Elick, MS, RD. These key nutrients primarily include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-is-too-much-protein-8407660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which are both essential.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian Lisa Moskovitz, RD, agrees: “If you’re looking for the most nutritious pasta, you’ll want to beeline to the fiber section first on the food label. Any brand with more than 5 grams of fiber per serving is a great source of this digestion-regulating, heart-healthy, and blood sugar-stabilizing nutrient.” Bonus points if each serving also contains at least 5 grams of muscle-preserving protein, and at least 25 percent of the RDA for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, Moskovitz points out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthiest-type-of-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Healthiest Type of Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, which type of pasta checks all these boxes? According to the three dietitians we interviewed, legume-based pasta is one of the best choices.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the name suggests, legume-based pasta is made with legumes rather than wheat. This may include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chickpeas-nutrition-6744549" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-black-beans-7254820" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;black beans&lt;/a&gt;, and red, green, or yellow lentils, notes Peterson. “Some brands also blend in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/health-benefits-of-peas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/edamame-nutrition" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt;,” she adds. And per Peterson, each legume offers its own subtle flavor and nutrient profile, but they’re all naturally rich in fiber and plant-based protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For context, legume pasta contains about five times more fiber than traditional white flour pasta, per Moskovitz. Here’s why that’s noteworthy: “Fiber is your gut’s best friend,” Moskovitz explains. “It keeps &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestion running smoothly&lt;/a&gt;, feeds good bacteria, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; for the average healthy adult,” she adds. Fiber also balances blood glucose levels and lowers cholesterol, says Elick. What’s more, “it helps to make you feel full sooner and longer, creating a sense of satiety that can help with weight management or weight loss,” Elick adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the protein department, legume pasta shines too. According to Peterson, a serving can pack 12 to 20 grams of protein—at least double the amount found in traditional pasta. “Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting muscle strength, building metabolism, and keeping you full and satisfied longer,” says Peterson. It also supports a variety of biological processes, including &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, hormone regulation, and DNA repair, per Elick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, legume-based pasta offers more minerals and vitamins than standard versions. “Many legume-based pastas contain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-iron-than-steak-11793217" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based iron&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body transport oxygen and maintain steady energy,” shares Peterson. They also offer &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/folate-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt;, which are involved in muscle function, blood pressure balance, and DNA synthesis, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, legume pastas are typically higher in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to boost your intake of these key molecules. “Antioxidants fight inflammation and protect the body against chronic degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease,” says Moskovitz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-eat-legume-based-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Eat Legume-Based Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In general, you can swap regular pasta for the legume kind in all your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-pasta-recipes-7971375" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pasta recipes&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s worth noting that legume pasta tends to have a heartier, slightly nuttier taste, and a smoother bite, notes Peterson. “Chickpea pasta is the mildest—closest to regular pasta—while lentil or black bean versions can have a more earthy flavor. The texture is often denser, which makes the dish feel more filling,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pro tip: “For the most balanced plate, pair legume pasta with colorful veggies and a drizzle of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil,&lt;/a&gt;” recommends Peterson. The vegetables add antioxidants and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetables-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange-11768257" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which supports iron absorption from legumes. Meanwhile, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; (from the olive oil) help your body absorb fat-soluble nutrients, Peterson points out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But remember, you don’t need to completely ditch white pasta or stick to legume varieties for optimal health. Instead, you can consider legume pasta whenever you’re looking for a boost of nutrients and satiety.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Real Simple</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTFc4cVVaSWt0cTRtN1RGOVZpMExENnhHVnhwbHR4VnNPUmJLenRrSWpkbXdjekl2N0o2eHJlV1BxRHhHUG9hX3h1bnVWVVUzcFd4VlJ4SkwtaEpwaU15dE5kVlJvSnNhUTZyQzFVWHB1U3p0aFlZVi1YYWVlV180QU13</guid></item><item><title>佛罗里达州的COVID疫苗现在更容易获得： Publix和Walgreens提供疫苗- Sun Sentinel</title><link>https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/23/covid-vaccines-in-florida-are-now-easier-to-get-publix-and-walgreens-make-shots-available/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 updated boosters are now easier to get in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Publix and Walgreens pharmacies in Florida will begin administering the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines to eligible patients without a prescription. They join CVS and CVS Minute Clinic, which had already been administering the shots — although with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said its Florida pharmacies are well stocked with booster shots and customers can make appointments on its portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In accordance with FDA approval, we offer the vaccine to all adults 65 years and older, as well as to individuals under 65 who are at higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19, as determined by the CDC,” Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://floridaspharmacy.gov/"&gt; Florida Board of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; met on Tuesday and advised that under existing statutes and rules, pharmacists, interns, and technicians in Florida may administer FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to eligible individuals 18 years and older under specific protocols. That means anyone 65 years of age and older are eligible to receive the vaccines, as well as individuals 64 years of age and younger with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Publix pharmacies are now accepting walk-ins for eligible patients, and we will begin offering appointments later today for as early as tomorrow,” Publix spokeswoman Lindsey Willis said Tuesday. Publix has 800 pharmacy locations in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said  Amy Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, though, any restrictions will be lifted, which is good news for Floridians who have been &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/09/covid-flu-rsv-vaccine-confusion-and-frustration-overwhelm-florida/"&gt;frustrated for weeks&lt;/a&gt; in their attempts to get the newest COVID booster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, vaccine advisers picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/19/covid-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;declined to specifically recommend the shots&lt;/a&gt; but said Americans could make individual decisions on whether to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the acting CDC director adopts the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recent recommendations, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Florida, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Sweeney had said of Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens has 1,600 pharmacies in Florida, and some locations offer Moderna shots, while others provide Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against winter surges in cases, as well as for protection on cruises and during other travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, CVS had been the only major retail pharmacy in the state giving out the 2025-2026 COVID booster shots. CVS had been requiring patients to be 65 or older or at risk for severe outcomes — and have a prescription. The CVS MinuteClinic also administered shots with a prescription or allowed a shot if its nurse practitioners prescribed it. Some CVS pharmacies carry the Moderna brand, while others carry Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccine is covered by most insurance plans at no cost for eligible patients,” said Thibault of CVS Health. “Patients should check with their insurer to determine whether the updated COVID-19 vaccine is covered by their individual health plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that most insurers &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/23/covid-19-vaccinations-insurance/"&gt;will cover the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the booster — at least through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces, and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaccines for Children program typically automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC’s vaccine committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large employers with their own insurance plans will make their own decisions on the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data presented to the CDC vaccine committee, about two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this season, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;

He can say for a fact that autism exists in the community, contrary to President Donald J.

Many also do not have health insurance, which means they pay out of pocket any time they go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He added that it‚Äôs hard to compare the study‚Äôs prevalence rate with the general population because the study only looked at Amish children and did not use the same autism screening tool to assess the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That would be like giving different tests to students in a class and then trying to rank them by their scores. The questions should be standardized to ensure an accurate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúWhat you would really need to do is administer that same questionnaire, maybe, to the general population, and see what you get,‚Äù Mitchell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Therefore, the data isn‚Äôt enough proof of there being lower rates of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;Administration zeros in on autism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At a White House news conference on Monday, the Trump administration announced sweeping actions to address rising rates of autism. Without presenting scientific proof, Trump said that Tylenol should not be used during pregnancy, claiming that it increases the risk of the child developing autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Medical societies and a &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/donald-trump-rfk-autism-link-drexel-20250922.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/donald-trump-rfk-autism-link-drexel-20250922.html"&gt;Drexel scientist who conducted a large-scale study on the topic disagreed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Trump also implied that vaccines and medications could be causes of autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúThere are certain groups of people that don‚Äôt take vaccines and don‚Äôt take any pills, that have no autism,‚Äù Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;‚ÄúDoes that tell you something?‚Äù he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He pointed to the Amish community as an example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;But&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;many Amish people do get vaccinated and use Tylenol, Mitchell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Amish people also aren‚Äôt immune to disease.

								&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health announced Monday it will break from federal guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine and endorse the recommendations of medical associations instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s panel of vaccine advisers opted not to give any recommendation on the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead it’s an individual choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/?p=3755105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine advisers change COVID shot guidance, calling them an individual choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📱 Recent studies reveal a &lt;strong&gt;46% increase&lt;/strong&gt; in hemorrhoid risk due to smartphone use in bathrooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🛀 Prolonged sitting on toilets with &lt;strong&gt;smartphones&lt;/strong&gt; is linked to increased health risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📊 Data shows that &lt;strong&gt;37.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of users spend over five minutes per bathroom visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Experts recommend &lt;strong&gt;limiting&lt;/strong&gt; bathroom smartphone use to under five minutes to reduce risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, the presence of smartphones in nearly every aspect of life is undeniable. From work to leisure, these devices have become an inseparable part of our daily routines. However, a recent study from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston suggests that this integration may come with unexpected health risks, particularly when it involves using smartphones in the bathroom. The study, published in PLOS One, highlights a significant link between prolonged smartphone use on the toilet and an increased risk of developing hemorrhoids. This revelation urges a closer examination of how this common habit might be affecting our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Hidden Risks of Bathroom Phone Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study in question surveyed 125 adults undergoing routine colonoscopies. It revealed that 66% of participants admitted to using their smartphones while on the toilet. Interestingly, 43% of these individuals had visible hemorrhoids upon endoscopic examination. &lt;strong&gt;The study found a 46% increased risk of hemorrhoids among those who frequently used their phones in the bathroom&lt;/strong&gt;. This association remained statistically significant even after adjusting for variables such as age, sex, body mass index, physical fitness, dietary fiber intake, and straining habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts point out that the core issue is the extended time spent sitting on the toilet. Whether this duration is prolonged by scrolling through social media or reading a book, the outcome appears to be the same. The digital age has shifted our attention from newspapers to screens, and the captivating nature of smartphone applications exacerbates this trend. As noted by gastroenterologist Trisha Pasricha, digital content is designed to engage users more effectively than traditional print media, potentially leading to longer bathroom sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zfqDemm7A8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/this-new-mandatory-smartphone-score-in-france-starts-now-and-could-change-how-millions-choose-their-next-device/"&gt;This New Mandatory Smartphone Score in France Starts Now and Could Change How Millions Choose Their Next Device&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the Physical Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of sitting on a toilet for extended periods can have adverse effects on the body. The human anatomy is not well-suited for prolonged toilet sitting, which can increase pressure and offer minimal pelvic floor support. These conditions create an environment conducive to the engorgement of hemorrhoidal cushions, leading to discomfort and potential medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study's findings are supported by data showing that 37.3% of smartphone users spend more than five minutes per bathroom visit, compared to only 7.1% of non-users. This disparity underscores the need to reevaluate how technology influences our daily habits and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WHd8JXgQG4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/04/worlds-first-tri-fold-smartphone-revolutionizes-tech-unprecedented-design-sparks-global-frenzy-redefines-future-of-mobile-devices/"&gt;World’s First Tri-Fold Smartphone Revolutionizes Tech: Unprecedented Design Sparks Global Frenzy, Redefines Future of Mobile Devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations From Medical Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts offer several practical recommendations to mitigate the risks associated with bathroom smartphone use. The simplest advice is to &lt;strong&gt;leave the smartphone outside the bathroom&lt;/strong&gt; whenever possible. For those who find this difficult, limiting time spent scrolling to no more than five minutes is advised. Using a timer or setting behavioral cues, such as standing up after two songs, can help enforce this limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, altering one's sitting posture can be beneficial. Utilizing a small stool to elevate the feet can mimic a squatting position, which is more natural and physiologically advantageous for the body. Maintaining a straight back and elevated knees can further reduce the risk of hemorrhoid development. &lt;i&gt;These adjustments are simple yet effective ways to promote better bathroom health.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Considerations and Limitations of the Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study presents compelling evidence, it is not without limitations. The authors caution that correlation does not imply causation. There is also potential for subjectivity in endoscopic reports, and the study's population predominantly consisted of individuals over 45 years old. Furthermore, the relatively recent emergence of smartphone use in bathrooms means long-term effects remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings encourage further research to explore the broader implications of this common habit. As smartphone usage continues to evolve, understanding its impact on health becomes increasingly important. What other aspects of our health might be influenced by our reliance on these devices, and how can we balance convenience with well-being?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Protein is more than just a buzzword; it's an important macronutrient, essential for our optimum health and wellbeing. Without it, we can begin losing muscle mass, experiencing poor metabolism and weakened immunity. It's a core part of healthy nutrition. Chicken has long been a popular protein source, thanks to how versatile and accessible it is. It's also lean, meaning it contains very little fat, appealing to those who need to moderate their fat intake. As great as it is, though, chicken does have one flaw — it gets boring. No matter how many different ways you prep it, at the end of the day it's still just chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To bring some variety to your protein choices, here's a list of 11 foods that actually have more protein than chicken. You'll find that certain types of fish or cheese are fantastic alternatives with a strong protein content. For the purposes of this article, we used nutritional information from the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;USDA Food Data Central&lt;/a&gt; website and looked at how much protein does a certain food item have per 100 grams. Since a skinless chicken breast comes with 22.5 grams of protein per 100 grams, let's see which foods can beat that.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Birds of a feather flock together, and so the first protein-rich alternative to chicken is another type of lean poultry. Turkey breast comes with 30.1 grams of protein and only 2.08 grams of fat per 100 grams of meat. Prep-wise, it's compatible with the same cooking techniques as chicken, except it's slightly on the drier side. On the upside, you'll find turkey has a bit more flavor on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Also known as ahi tuna, yellowfin is one of the most popular tuna species. People know it for the quality, so it's often the go-to for raw dishes like sushi and sashimi. When eaten raw, yellowfin tuna comes with 24.4 grams of protein per 100 grams of fish. When cooked, the protein content jumps to 29.9 grams.

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Shrimp hits pretty close to chicken when it comes to protein, but at 24 grams of protein per 100 grams of shrimp, it still ranks a bit higher. This seafood is one of the best ways to diversify your meals while keeping them nutritionally rich. If you're tired of the chicken Caesar salad, a &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/725752/grilled-summer-shrimp-salad-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;grilled summer shrimp salad&lt;/a&gt; would be the perfect swap.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At 25.55 grams of protein per 100 grams of meat, ground beef certainly comes ahead of chicken. It also has a significantly higher fat content — 16.82 grams to chicken's 1.93 grams. Because it has more fat, beef is a lot juicier, more flavorful, and more satiating than chicken. That's why ground beef is a staple in many classic recipes, such as spaghetti bolognese, lasagna, and &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/686921/classic-italian-meatball-recipe-homemade-tomato-sauce-best-italian-recipes/" target="_blank"&gt;special Italian meatballs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Adding more protein to your diet can also come through snacks. Beef jerky is a super flavorful, meaty snack that packs 33.2 grams of protein per 100 grams of jerky. Now, you're unlikely to ever eat that amount of jerky at once, so many brands include the protein-per-serving info right on the package. &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-225e4e0aac880b8f&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FClassic-Country-Archer-Grass-Fed-Gluten%2Fdp%2FB08BB8785X%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3DO8F6SSNNGOU2%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.I8UETgXv0Tf3qK44zVgHBNGXXH_MOlTv3665z4Bl5yZ4QeRsjhFXVDJyNIcQc6ta4VURNeQWsti2lTswCVQbzB7mw07OMwuhkFHe82tE3faeSFnIj3YWQfEk8ZWla3KiTSmu1r4lO6ZprkDGln2NeWcePpf9FHa6UYuaCDsn-CLn7oUr2odpqci-4EKn8YUdMqF_PTE0p6VhyJLr3Ae_JLDoEZRjU_qaPIa3uW4PxkX6ROl-EHTEi1RDiEDC3_aLh7hVxdV50cCqz8gG-Ecr9BAqzZ0dpYNSKHvuPnKdC9A.mIwyUz7ewFuTIHGRnjJvhXph1nLhBk3jETCRYyzlndY%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3DCountry%2BArcher%2BZero%2BSugar%2BClassic%2BGrass-Fed%2BBeef%2BJerky%26qid%3D1758116125%26sprefix%3Dcountry%2Barcher%2Bzero%2Bsugar%2Bclassic%2Bgrass-fed%2Bbeef%2Bjerky%2Bread%2Bmore%2Bhttps%2B%2F%2Fwww.tastingtable.com%2F1847549%2Fbeef-jerky-brands-ranked%2F%2Caps%2C2682%26sr%3D8-1%26th%3D1%26tag%3Dstaticmedia-tastingtable-20&amp;amp;btn_pub_ref=1971747-in_text-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow"&gt;Country Archer Grass Fed Beef Jerky&lt;/a&gt;, for example, comes with 12 grams of protein per serving on top of being ranked as No. 1 in our &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1847549/beef-jerky-brands-ranked/" target="_blank"&gt;ranking of beef jerky brands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you're vegetarian (or simply a dairy enthusiast), you'll be happy to learn that Swiss cheese, despite its big holes, carries 27 grams of protein per 100 grams of cheese. The number might vary between the different types, though. Gruyère, for example, could have as much as 29.8 grams of protein. It's delicious in its solid form, of course, but we especially love it in &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/686213/cheese-fondue-gruyere-swiss-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;homemade Swiss cheese fondue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dried fish is another protein-rich snack — and one that comes with other nutritional benefits, too. It's high in vitamin B12, which is important for the functioning of the central nervous system. B12 deficiencies are very common, especially in the elderly population. There are different types of dried fish you can choose from, depending on your preference. Dried cod contains 62.8 grams of protein per 100 grams, which is nearly three times as much as chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

Mostly, he blamed parents. They raised the kids in what he called &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1111%2Fj.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1111%2Fj.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x"&gt;“emotional refrigerators.”&lt;/a&gt; A Time magazine piece on Kanner’s theories was titled &lt;a href="https://time.com/archive/6600845/medicine-frosted-children/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://time.com/archive/6600845/medicine-frosted-children/"&gt;“Frosted Children,”&lt;/a&gt; and told a story about kids who seemed “normal” at birth, but then became “apathetic, withdrawn, happiest when left alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;With the exception of the Time piece, Kanner mostly (according to Steve Silberman’s magisterial history of autism, &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310415/neurotribes-by-steve-silberman-foreword-by-oliver-sacks/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310415/neurotribes-by-steve-silberman-foreword-by-oliver-sacks/"&gt;“Neurotribes”&lt;/a&gt;) published his theories in academic journals. Over the next few decades, Bruno Bettelheim, another child psychiatrist, publicized the idea that non-nurturing mothers (and to some extent perfectionist fathers) were to blame for autism. Bettelheim’s bestselling book, “The Empty Fortress,” which was published in 1967, blamed autism on parents who deserted their children emotionally, caring for their body, but not their soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The “refrigerator mother” myth went viral, as we’d say now, and was used as a justification for taking children away from their parents and subjecting the kids to ever-harsher treatments.

But a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;study of 2.4 million Swedish children&lt;/a&gt; from 1995-2019, a huge sample size, demonstrated that “acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Tara Smith, an epidemiology professor at Kent State University, gave me her reaction to Trump’s news conference on Monday. “As a scientist, it was one of the worst things I’ve seen since Trump’s ‘inject bleach’ outing,“ she said in an email. ”It was full of misinformation and innuendo that scientists have been hiding data or avoiding investigations that may be inconvenient. In reality, the questions about autism and vaccines and autism and acetaminophen have been asked and answered.” That, pending new evidence, should be the end of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:57:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOU0oxb0FHTlM4cVV5eDNjRHljVDFUX1ZFSDZ3V291cjdIU2N5X3U5QkkxVnJSSEEyU1FpRDVuRkc5Z3ZEWWJwZzd1VW5RM0dsTnV3U3BHOUxrZnB4SWw2YTBMUnZmaUpiTjFORmtVR0Q3THlRSm9PQjBYQURiM0xVUA</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射：研究表明开始和停止的危险- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51376600/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

&lt;p&gt;POLICE Service Social and Welfare Association treasurer Sgt Jason Johnson says he hopes the association’s new health and wellness initiative will encourage police officers to take better care of themselves, both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Newsday at the Vehicle Management Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago (VMCOTT) compound in Beetham on September 23, Johnson said while the health fair was not a new concept to the association, it was the largest of its kind ever hosted, and he hoped the initiative would become an annual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179961" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179961" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426813-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179961" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers visiting various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23. - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the first time we are attempting an initiative of this magnitude. It’s a partnership involving corporate stakeholders, including Guardian Life and Blue Waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several tents were set up for the fair, offering a range of health-focused services. Despite the bad weather, several officers, including some on duty, visited the booths and accessed services such as blood pressure and blood glucose testing, vision screening, massage therapy, and herbal medicine consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179960" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179960" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426816-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179960" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers at various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23, - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson stressed the goal of the initiative was to bring attention to the health of officers and to highlight issues many may not even realise they are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really an effort to bring awareness to officers about their health and underlying issues, to shine a light on those issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Newsday spoke with Johnson around 11 am, the turnout was already encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s still early in the morning, but we’ve been seeing a good amount of foot traffic. Inside, we have several services available: a massage therapist, blood glucose testing, vision screening, and dental screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179962" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426814-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers visiting various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23, 2025. - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair, which began around 9 am, was scheduled to continue until 5 pm to accommodate officers working different shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also have cancer screening and several other health services available to members of the police service and other extended services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson said one of his biggest concerns is the number of officers who suffer or die from lifestyle-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen officers dying from complications related to diabetes, strokes, and heart disease. That’s why this initiative is so important, to raise awareness and encourage preventive care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled the recent loss of the association’s last Welfare Committee chairman, who died from a medical condition, as a catalyst for launching the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the impetus for us to say, ‘Let’s do something.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want officers to understand that their health care is their welfare. We’re encouraging them to get regular check-ups and be proactive. Preventive care can ensure a better quality of life, both on and off duty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fair was largely health-focused, Johnson emphasised mental health was also a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have services focused on mental well-being. Our police doctor is here to provide counselling and support as needed. We’ve also included massage therapy to help create a relaxing and supportive environment. So we’re not only addressing physical health but mental wellness as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final message to officers, Johnson encouraged all ranks to prioritise their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the job is physically and mentally demanding, but even dedicating ten to 15 minutes a day to exercise, relaxation, or therapy can make a big difference. We want to see healthier, more balanced officers, both for themselves and for the communities they serve.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What gives rise to human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="175128" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;? Are some parts of the brain more important than others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists began tackling these questions in more depth about 35 years ago. Researchers have made progress, but the mystery of consciousness remains very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;recently published article&lt;/a&gt;, I reviewed over 100 years of neuroscience research to see if some brain regions are more important than others for consciousness. What I found suggests scientists who study consciousness may have been undervaluing the most ancient regions of human brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;defined by neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; as the ability to have subjective experience, such as the experience of tasting an apple or of seeing the redness of its skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-consciousness-work-duelling-scientists-tested-two-big-theories-but-found-no-winner-255610"&gt;theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the outer layer of the human brain, called the cortex (in blue in figure 1), is fundamental to consciousness. This is mostly composed of the neocortex, which is newer in our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human subcortex (figure 1, brown/beige), underneath the neocortex, has not changed much in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438824000400?via%3Dihub"&gt;last 500 million years&lt;/a&gt;. It is thought to be like electricity for a TV, necessary for consciousness, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another part of the brain that some neuroscientific theories of consciousness state &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44"&gt;is irrelevant&lt;/a&gt; for consciousness. This is the cerebellum, which is also older than the neocortex and looks like a little brain tucked in the back of the skull (figure 1, purple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HumanBrainCerebellumCortexSubcortex-e1758598683378.jpeg" alt="Diagram of human brain showing the positions of the Cortex, Subcortex and Cerebellum" class="wp-image-175133 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1, the human brain (made with the assistance of AI). (Peter Coppola/CC BY SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain activity and brain networks are disrupted in unconsciousness (like in a coma). &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;These changes&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What brain stimulation reveals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of my analysis, I looked at studies showing what happens to consciousness when brain activity is changed, for example, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632334/"&gt;applying electrical currents&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94051-5#Sec2"&gt;magnetic pulses&lt;/a&gt; to brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments in humans and animals showed that altering activity in any of these three parts of the brain can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;alter consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Changing the activity of the neocortex can change your sense of self, make you hallucinate, or affect your judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the subcortex may have extreme effects. We can &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199905133401905"&gt;induce depression&lt;/a&gt;, wake a monkey from anaesthesia, or knock a mouse unconscious. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Even stimulating the cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, long considered irrelevant, can change your conscious sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this research does not allow us to reach strong conclusions about where consciousness comes from, as stimulating one brain region may affect another region. Like unplugging the TV from the socket, we might be changing the conditions that support consciousness, but not the mechanisms of consciousness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I looked at some evidence from patients to see if it would help resolve this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage from physical trauma or lack of oxygen to the brain can disrupt your experience. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Injury to the neocortex&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://karger.com/ene/article-abstract/84/3/157/125434/Cognitive-and-Behavioral-Disorders-in-Patients?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;make you think&lt;/a&gt; your hand is not yours, fail to notice things on one side of your visual field, or become more impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born without the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614135/"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5964834"&gt;the front of their cortex&lt;/a&gt;, can still appear conscious and live quite normal lives. However, damaging the cerebellum &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211002061?via%3Dihub"&gt;later in life&lt;/a&gt; can trigger hallucinations or change your emotions completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm to the most ancient parts of our brain can directly cause unconsciousness (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/126/7/1524/299341?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;although some people recover&lt;/a&gt;) or death. However, like electricity for a TV, the subcortex may be just keeping the newer cortex "online", which may be giving rise to consciousness. So I wanted to know whether, alternatively, there is evidence that the most ancient regions are sufficient for consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rare cases of children being born without most or all of their neocortex. According to medical textbooks, these people should be in a permanent vegetative state. However, there &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;are reports&lt;/a&gt; that these people can feel upset, play, recognize people, or show enjoyment of music. This suggests that they are having some sort of conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reports are striking evidence that suggests maybe the oldest parts of the brain are enough for basic consciousness. Or maybe, when you are born without a cortex, the older parts of the brain adapt to take on some of the roles of the newer parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some extreme experiments on animals that can help us reach a conclusion. Across mammals – from rats to cats to monkeys – surgically removing the neocortex leaves them &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1999.tb00621.x"&gt;still capable&lt;/a&gt; of an astonishing number of things. They can play, show emotions, groom themselves, parent their young, and even learn. Surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425003343?via%3Dihub"&gt;even adult animals&lt;/a&gt; that underwent this surgery showed similar behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the view that the cortex is necessary for consciousness, as most major theories of consciousness suggest. It seems that the oldest parts of the brain are enough for some basic forms of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer parts of the brain – as well as the cerebellum – seem to expand and refine your consciousness. This means we may have to review our theories of consciousness. In turn, this may influence patient care as well as how we think about animal rights. In fact, consciousness might be more common than we realized.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264609/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/tylenol-autism-trump-rfk-pregnant-fever-n0w3fv7t0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen — known in Britain as paracetamol, and the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of concerns it may increase the risk of autism in unborn children. But millions of mothers use paracetamol to manage pain and fevers during their pregnancies because it’s the only drug available to them to safely do so. Or at least, that’s what they’ve been told for the past few decades, but apparently no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HHS’ rationale for the new Tylenol warning is based on a systematic review led by Harvard Dean of Public Health Andrea Baccarelli. Dr. Baccarelli’s &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-announcement-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; contends that there is a “strong, consistent association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ADHD/ASD/other NDDs”. The review emphasised that this result was exceptionally robust, that it stood strong in studies controlling for bundles of different confounders, with negative control exposure periods, and with propensity score matching. The only problem is that &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/you-cant-just-control-for-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;none of these methods&lt;/a&gt; are reliable and the authors actually ignored some good evidence that contradicts their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main failing point of the review is that its authors knew about good evidence in the form of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;sibling control studies&lt;/a&gt; — studies where scientists compare a sibling who is exposed to Tylenol &lt;i&gt;in utero &lt;/i&gt;to a sibling who wasn’t exposed to it — and they ignored those results. But those studies were the strongest; it just happens to be the case that those studies didn’t find anything alarming. To me, that seems like the correct explanation for why the authors were &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/174283509/does-tylenol-cause-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;so gung-ho&lt;/a&gt; to attack them on spurious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest, highest-quality &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used almost 2.5 million births from Sweden between 1995 and 2019, used great measures of Tylenol exposure in a country where most Tylenol use is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13003" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by prescription&lt;/a&gt;, and they found much the same as the other non-causal studies: mothers who used more Tylenol during pregnancy have children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders more often. But they went further than replicating that purely correlational association. In fact, they showed that, when comparing differentially exposed siblings, the one exposed to Tylenol was no more likely to have any disorder than the one who was not exposed. In other words, the association isn’t causal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="94" data-end="388"&gt;The review was plagued by non-sequiturs. It cited weak evidence as if it were strong. The authors failed to quantitatively synthesise the findings of the studies they referenced. Worse, they botched the table entries and even cited studies in ways directly contradicted by the studies themselves. The review was lazy, but it ostensibly supports what some people really want to believe: that Tylenol causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bastardised faux-science masquerading as real information, millions of pregnant women will be scared into avoiding Tylenol or any brand of paracetamol, even when it might be the drug they need. Mothers who need to break a fever or manage pain have no alternatives: opiates aren’t acceptable, and Ibuprofen isn’t safe before foetuses have undergone about two trimesters of growth. If it were true that Tylenol is causing autism, then there might be some debate to be had about the risk-reward calculus for letting pregnant women use it, but there isn’t. The science is abundantly clear: Tylenol &lt;i&gt;does not &lt;/i&gt;cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is one reason, aside from cultural and religious considerations, some people kick off their shoes at the door. But while gross, the germs on your shoes are unlikely to cause illness, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a small, widely cited study, researchers found that fecal bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, which can make you sick if they are ingested or make their way into a cut in your skin, were commonly present on the bottoms of shoes. And when those shoes came into contact with clean flooring, 90-99 percent of the bacteria were transferred to it. (The study was not peer reviewed and was funded by a shoe company marketing washable shoes.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The first three or four steps when you walk in the house are the most contaminated on the floor because you’re bringing all that stuff from outside and walking on the floors,” said Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other studies have reported that &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can also be found on the bottoms of shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We live in a germy world,” and bacteria and viruses can be found on nearly any object, including our shoes, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. But there aren’t any instances in the scientific literature of pathogens being transmitted from the soles of shoes to noses or mouths in high enough numbers to initiate infections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That’s why we don’t have public health recommendations that people sanitize their shoes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Schaffner, who sometimes wears street shoes in his own home, said it is more notable that “our hands can pick up germs, and then we touch our mouths, noses and eyes. That’s the mode of inoculation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Going shoeless at home has another benefit, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When you wear shoes all the time, it may lead to deconditioning of the deeper muscles of the foot, said Amiethab Aiyer, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in foot and ankle conditions at Johns Hopkins. “Their relative strength and relative conditioning could lapse over time,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From the perspective of maintaining strength and conditioning of the musculature in the feet, and to avoid the germ elements, it may be helpful to not wear shoes around the house,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From a cultural perspective, Aiyer, who is Indian American, said he and his family do not wear shoes in the house, both for cleanliness and out of respect for the home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, some people shouldn’t go barefoot at home. For example, if you have poor circulation or conditions such as neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the feet that can be caused by diabetes or chemotherapy, it can lead to the loss of protective sensation that may affect your ability to detect objects under foot, Aiyer said. Additionally, people who are at increased risk of falling may need traction or improved perceived balance that shoes can provide, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_else_you_should_know" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

However, if you are concerned about dirt or germs, here are tips from experts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-wash shoes with soap and warm water to remove dirt and debris, particularly from the soles of shoes. Mix water with a small amount of dish soap and a washing powder (sodium carbonate), and give the bottoms “a good thorough scrub with a strong bristle brush,” said Zachary Pozniak, co-owner of Jeeves New York, a dry cleaning and shoe cleaning and repair service. Insoles that are removable can be handwashed and air-dried before placing them back in the shoe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disinfect the soles with a spray or wipe to help kill germs. Look for products registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to kill particular pathogens such as norovirus, a highly contagious germ that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness. For better control when using disinfectant sprays, spray a clean towel with the solution and wipe the soles of the shoes rather than spraying directly onto the shoe, Pozniak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Machine wash shoes only when the manufacturer label states so. Before washing shoes in the machine, pretreat stains by hand in the sink, Pozniak said. Do not wash materials such as leather or suede.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air dry unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Clothes dryers can ruin shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bottom line: Our shoes can carry germs into the house, but they alone are unlikely to cause illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBxY19mS05OOXcyRC1tZl9vMS1HQ0VmWXJXdk41VVdySTVBdFRpaHl6eW5xVnpuR2hQd1Fsd3JCVUl5UjZfTDR5c09vbGktTy1jRV9SNmFySGg4a2FyMC0xWDdhMlVKT1hCMEI0a2xOTGtDZUVONXY0</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的研究人员表示，美国的耐药“噩梦细菌”病例正在上升-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome," said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-resistant-infections-new-antibiotics-needed-high-cost-preventing-development/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-become-a-bigger-killer-than-cancer-60-minutes-2019-04-21/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance," said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections "is definitely underestimated," Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

The next morning, you feel groggy and irritable. That sugary pastry or greasy breakfast sandwich suddenly looks more appealing than your usual yogurt and berries. By the afternoon, chips or candy from the break room call your name. This isn’t just about willpower. Your brain, short on rest, is nudging you toward quick, high-calorie fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why this cycle repeats itself so predictably. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-022-00747-7"&gt;insufficient sleep disrupts hunger signals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101514"&gt;weakens self-control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2018.02.010"&gt;impairs glucose metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23539"&gt;increases your risk of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. These changes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0250-18.2018"&gt;can occur rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, even after a single night of poor sleep, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14926"&gt;can become more harmful over time&lt;/a&gt; if left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;neurologist specializing in sleep science&lt;/a&gt; and its impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation affects millions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of U.S. adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/adults-sleep-facts-and-stats.html"&gt;regularly get less than seven hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt; per night. Nearly three-quarters of adolescents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/high-school-students-sleep-facts-and-stats.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;fall short of the recommended 8-10 hours sleep&lt;/a&gt; during the school week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anyone can suffer from sleep loss, essential workers and first responders, including nurses, firefighters and emergency personnel, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i5210"&gt;especially vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13154505"&gt;due to night shifts and rotating schedules&lt;/a&gt;. These patterns disrupt the body’s internal clock and are linked to increased cravings, poor eating habits and elevated risks for obesity and metabolic disease. Fortunately, even a few nights of consistent, high-quality sleep can help rebalance key systems and start to reverse some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How sleep deficits disrupt hunger hormones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body regulates hunger through a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2402679"&gt;hormonal feedback loop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2025.171367"&gt;involving two key hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghrelin, produced primarily in the stomach, signals that you are hungry, while leptin, which is produced in the fat cells, tells your brain that you are full. Even one night of restricted sleep &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;increases the release of ghrelin and decreases leptin&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to greater hunger and reduced satisfaction after eating. This shift is driven by changes in how the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;body regulates hunger&lt;/a&gt; and stress. Your brain becomes less responsive to fullness signals, while at the same time &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13051"&gt;ramping up stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; that can increase cravings and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes are not subtle. In controlled lab studies, healthy adults reported &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00662.x"&gt;increased hunger and stronger cravings&lt;/a&gt; for calorie-dense foods after sleeping only four to five hours. The effect worsens with ongoing sleep deficits, which can lead to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13051"&gt;chronically elevated appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the brain shifts into reward mode&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep loss changes how your brain evaluates food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3259"&gt;after just one night of sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.027383"&gt;has reduced activity&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0250-18.2018"&gt;reward-related areas such as the amygdala&lt;/a&gt; and the nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain that drives motivation and reward-seeking, become &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx125"&gt;more reactive to tempting food cues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, your brain becomes more tempted by junk food and less capable of resisting it. Participants in sleep deprivation studies not only rated high-calorie foods as more desirable but were also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.027383"&gt;more likely to choose them&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of how hungry they actually felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your metabolism slows, leading to increased fat storage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also critical for blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re well rested, your body efficiently uses insulin to move sugar out of your bloodstream and into your cells for energy. But even one night of partial sleep can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-2430"&gt;reduce insulin sensitivity by up to 25%&lt;/a&gt;, leaving more sugar circulating in your blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your body can’t process sugar effectively, it’s more likely to convert it into fat. This contributes to weight gain, especially around the abdomen. Over time, poor sleep is associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000444"&gt;higher risk for Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916"&gt;group of health issues&lt;/a&gt; such as high blood pressure, belly fat and high blood sugar that raise the risk for heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, sleep loss raises cortisol, your body’s main stress hormone. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-4254"&gt;Elevated cortisol encourages fat storage&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the abdominal region, and can further disrupt appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep is your metabolic reset button&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a culture that glorifies hustle and late nights, sleep is often treated as optional. But your body doesn’t see it that way. Sleep is not downtime. It is active, essential repair. It is when your brain recalibrates hunger and reward signals, your hormones reset and your metabolism stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one or two nights of quality sleep can begin to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00301.2013"&gt;undo the damage from prior sleep loss&lt;/a&gt; and restore your body’s natural balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you find yourself reaching for junk food after a short night, recognize that your biology is not failing you. It is reacting to stress and fatigue. The most effective way to restore balance isn’t a crash diet or caffeine. It’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not a luxury. It is your most powerful tool for appetite control, energy regulation and long-term health.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255726/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255726/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The good news is that experts say you can outsmart that resistance by leaning into how the brain actually works. If &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/time-management/procrastination" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;procrastination keeps tripping you up&lt;/a&gt;, these strategies are designed to lower the friction and make hard tasks feel a lot more doable, whether you’re pushing through burnout or simply looking to build better habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resisting difficult tasks, even the ones that we know are good for us, isn’t laziness—it’s a protective reflex. “The brain isn’t wired for what’s good for us, it’s wired for what feels safe and efficient,” explains Courtney Shrum, LMHC, licensed therapist and nervous system educator. “Difficult tasks trigger uncertainty, effort, or potential failure, which the nervous system reads as risk.” Here, we asked mental health experts for eight tangible ways to tackle hard tasks.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calling your parents, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/habits-people-with-clean-kitchens-always-follow-11723815" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;scrubbing the kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, or finishing that report by Friday can all feel like obligations. But reframing those tasks as choices by shifting your mindset from “I have to” into “I choose to” can help motivate you. “Autonomy is fuel for motivation,” Shrum says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So instead of saying “I have to work out,” try reframing it as, “I’m choosing to move because I want more energy for my day,” Shrum says. “Choice activates reward pathways and lowers resistance because it feels less like a threat and more like agency.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Difficult tasks often feel threatening to the brain, triggering the stress response, which makes thinking clearly and taking action harder. “Physical activation cues your nervous system to shift states, breaking the freeze that comes with overwhelm,” Shrum says of the quick, body-based intervention that helps you engage with a task. A somatic reset can be as simple as standing up, taking a brisk walk, running through a few rounds of slow belly breaths, or shaking out your arms for 30 seconds and rolling your shoulders before &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-do-laundry-8764101" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tackling laundry&lt;/a&gt; or a tough phone call.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pairing an unpleasant but necessary task, like laundry or dishes, with something more enjoyable, like listening to your favorite podcast or sipping a fancy coffee, taps into the brain’s reward system, making the chore feel lighter. “Adding a rewarding ritual to an unpleasant activity can pair an immediate reward with our desired outcome, helping our ‘designed for immediate returns’ brain be more amenable to the task at hand,” says Alexandra McNulty, LCSW-C, BCHN, psychotherapist and founder of McNulty Wellness Collective. “It can also prompt motivation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; McNulty suggests thinking about ways to romanticize the tasks you keep putting off, which can be as small as lighting a candle and turning on some music. “Think about small, accessible ways you can inject more joy into the mundane,” she says. “Ambiance can help set the vibe.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When tackling a difficult task, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/phone-timer-cleaning-trick-8679527" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;set a timer for just five minutes&lt;/a&gt;, giving yourself full permission to stop when it goes off. “This might seem counterintuitive, but getting started is the hardest part, and often clients find that if they can get over that hump, they will usually end up continuing once they have momentum,” McNulty says, referring to the scientific phenomenon called the ‘&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/zeigarnik-effect-11683645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Zeigarnik Effect&lt;/a&gt;’. “It’s much easier to convince your brain that you can do something for five minutes rather than the 45 minutes of a workout or the nebulous ‘however long it takes’ when it comes to chores.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@594e83be" data-item-index="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If a task feels overwhelming and you catch yourself not knowing where to start, breaking it down into smaller, concrete steps can help you get past brain resistance by lowering its threat level and giving you a clear roadmap. “Motivation stems from action,” McNulty says. “We are more likely to act and take that first step when we know what it is.” For example, the task of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/room-by-room-decluttering-tips" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;decluttering an entire closet&lt;/a&gt; could be broken down into starting with just one shelf or drawer, then sorting items into keep or donate piles, boxing donations immediately, re-organizing the cleaned shelf, and repeating with the next shelf tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This strategy works in part because it shifts the focus from outcome to process. “Outcomes are sometimes beyond our control, and because of this, we can easily become overwhelmed or prone to perfectionism and thus, avoidance,” McNulty says. “By focusing on the process of how we are showing up through smaller, identifiable actions, we are helping to decrease fear and overwhelm by de-emphasizing what we can’t control and emphasizing what we can.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To nudge your brain toward action, psychologist and empowerment coach Dr. Andrea Gleim, LPC, suggests briefly picturing the finished outcome and how it feels. For example, completing a 20-minute workout with a slightly sweaty shirt, a calmer mood, and a check mark on your calendar. Then, identifying the most likely obstacle and your very first action, such as laying out your workout clothes so that changing after work (even when you’re tired) feels effortless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Bringing the future reward into the present boosts motivation and reduces the brain’s desire for instant gratification,” Gleim says. “Naming the obstacle preps your brain to recognize it and follow a ready-made plan instead of stalling.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@7995c93c" data-item-index="6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tackle a difficult task alongside someone else—live or virtual—or report progress to a partner, group, or coach. Even body doubling, where another person is present while you work quietly, can add gentle pressure. “Social presence reduces the urge to procrastinate by adding immediate rewards, like connection and being seen, and light consequences, as someone will notice if you bail,” Dr. Gleim says. “It also lowers anxiety and narrows attention, making it easier to start.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re catching up on overdue emails, schedule a 30-minute co-working session on Zoom with cameras on, Dr. Gleim suggests. “You both state one goal at the top, mute, and work,” she says. “At minute 25, unmute to share wins and choose the next micro-step.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@2dce148" data-item-index="7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Timing matters when it comes to tackling challenging tasks. The prefrontal cortex, which handles planning and self-control, works best when you’re rested and not overloaded. “For most people, mid-morning or early afternoon are high-focus windows," Dr. Gleim says. "Therefore, align harder tasks there and reserve admin for low-energy times."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Missing a task on your to-do list can trigger shame, which makes it harder to re-engage in the task. Experts agree that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/how-to-forgive-yourself" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; is key, as it quiets the brain’s threat response and shifts you back into problem-solving mode. “When you respond to a miss with kindness and curiosity—‘what got in the way, and what’s the next tiny step?’—you reduce avoidance, recover faster, and stick with the habit longer,” Dr. Gleim says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the end of the study, the average score increased by almost three points, from 25 pre-test to 27.7 post-test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessments are required and a person may have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro-walking positively influences cognitive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances executive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also highlight that cognitive impairment is becoming more common among older adults, driven by the aging global population and the increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About seven million people in the US aged 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a beneficial effect on cognitive health, retro walking has also been found to have many other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glazier and Dr Ko wrote: '&lt;span&gt;It can strengthen the muscles in the back; increase strength and flexibility in the hamstrings; strengthen the ankles; improve balance, posture and coordination; and even ease lower back pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to a decreased range of motion in the knees and hips, retro walking can be kinder to those joints.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking backward can also increase the energy you use by 40 percent, upping calorie burn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And without being able to see in front of you, your body has to rely more on something called proprioception, the built-in sense of where you are in space. This can fine turn coordination and stability and strengthen your ability to focus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better stability and balance is crucial in older adults as it can prevent falls and the potentially deadly complications that result.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Those at the Budge Clinic, 1350 N 500 East in Logan, between 3-6:30 p.m. on Sep. 15 may have also been exposed, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department says those exposed at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the restaurant should watch for symptoms — like a high fever and cough, or a rash — through Oct. 2, and those exposed at the clinic should be on the lookout through Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Cache County is the fourth county that the department has confirmed cases in during the current outbreak, which began in June with a single&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;case in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Of the confirmed measles cases, 25 have been in the Southwest Utah district (consisting of Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington Counties), three in the Southeast district (Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan counties), seven in Utah County and one in the Bear River district, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Three of those districts — Bear River, Utah County and Southwest Utah — have also seen &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/"&gt;measles in their wastewater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;within the past month, the health department reports.

That watch in southern Utah ends Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Sep. 16, there were 1,491 confirmed measles cases in 42 jurisdictions across the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Last year, the CDC says the U.S. saw only 285 cases. Weekly cases throughout the nation spiked this year in March, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear within one to two weeks of exposure, according to the health department, and can consist of a high fever and cough, runny nose or red eyes. After four days of fever, the department says a rash will normally appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those who develop symptoms should stay away from other people and call their healthcare provider before going to their doctor, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The best way to prevent measles, according to the health department, is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine from their healthcare provider.

At the end of the study, the average score increased by almost three points, from 25 pre-test to 27.7 post-test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessments are required and a person may have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro-walking positively influences cognitive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances executive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also highlight that cognitive impairment is becoming more common among older adults, driven by the aging global population and the increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a beneficial effect on cognitive health, retro walking has also been found to have many other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glazier and Dr Ko wrote: '&lt;span&gt;It can strengthen the muscles in the back; increase strength and flexibility in the hamstrings; strengthen the ankles; improve balance, posture and coordination; and even ease lower back pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to a decreased range of motion in the knees and hips, retro walking can be kinder to those joints.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking backward can also increase the energy you use by 40 percent, upping calorie burn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And without being able to see in front of you, your body has to rely more on something called proprioception, the built-in sense of where you are in space. This can fine turn coordination and stability and strengthen your ability to focus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better stability and balance is crucial in older adults as it can prevent falls and the potentially deadly complications that result.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She never thought a quick wade in the water would end her husband’s life weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — A Virginia teacher is sharing a painful lesson after losing her husband to a rare but deadly flesh-eating bacterium called vibrio. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce D'Arcy is mourning her husband Derek's death, which happened just 13 days after a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach in August, their favorite place. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It came from our favorite place to go — Virginia Beach was our favorite place to go," Joyce said. "It's just so sad that the best place we like to go is where he got sick." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple’s day at the beach involved a simple, calf-high wade in the water, which was all it took for the bacteria to enter Derek's body through a small, open cut on his leg. Four days later, Joyce noticed a purple stripe on his leg. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The skin was just purple," she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the blood test results confirmed it was Vibrio three days later, the infection had already ravaged his lower legs. Derek, a pastor and painter, had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which Joyce believes contributed to the swiftness of the infection. Doctors made the difficult decision to amputate both legs, but just 12 hours after the surgery, the infection had spread to his chest, head and hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We knew we lost the fight," Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is now speaking out to warn others, emphasizing how quickly one can die from this bacteria, which Cleveland Clinic doctors say is more common than people think, particularly during the warmer months of May through October.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hope is that by sharing her husband's story, she can prevent another family from experiencing the same devastating loss.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating breakfast improves insulin sensitivity and helps prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mix of fiber, protein and healthy fats at breakfast keeps you full and steady.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular breakfast eaters tend to have healthier weights and lower risk of diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar management&lt;/a&gt; is top of mind for people with diabetes, everyone can benefit from having stable blood sugar levels, whether they have diabetes or not. Taking steps to avoid blood sugar spikes (and crashes) can support your overall energy and metabolic health. And while you might think that skipping breakfast will help keep your blood sugar stable, the opposite is actually true. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skip your morning meal&lt;/a&gt;, your body is more likely to experience bigger swings in blood sugar later in the day, and you may experience more intense cravings and energy dips that can make it difficult to manage your appetite. “How you start the morning sets the tone for your energy, hunger and cravings for the rest of the day,” says &lt;a href="https://modifyhealth.com/pages/executive-team-new" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Madison Reeder, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s why starting your day with a balanced breakfast supports better blood sugar management and metabolic health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly eating breakfast is linked to a reduced risk of diabetes and better blood sugar management. Here’s how.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Improve Insulin Sensitivity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How well your cells react to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; determines how easily and efficiently glucose is shuttled from your bloodstream into your cells for energy. “When you skip breakfast, your body stays in a prolonged fasting mode and becomes less sensitive to insulin,” says Reeder. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the body breaks down lipids for energy during extended fasting, higher levels of free fatty acids in the blood can disrupt insulin receptors from working properly, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels after meals. Researchers suspect that skipping breakfast may also interfere with the body’s circadian rhythm, which helps to regulate insulin secretion and other factors impacting blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps You Eat More Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; with your meals not only helps you feel more full and satisfied, but it can also have a substantial effect on your blood sugar. One study found that diets high in fiber may lower HbA1C by an average of 0.66% and reduce fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “People who eat breakfast get more fiber and essential nutrients and consume less added sugar over the day,” says Reeder. And while some research suggests that skipping breakfast could result in a reduced calorie intake of around 250 calories per day, the reduction in daily diet quality is likely to have a negative impact on health over time. Breakfast skippers tend to eat less fruit and whole grains, both of which are significant sources of fiber in the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a larger meal for breakfast can help you feel less hungry as the day wears on. Skipping breakfast decreases leptin (the hormone that helps you feel full) and increases ghrelin (the hormone responsible for hunger) which can lead to feeling hungrier and less satisfied when you do eat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This ‘feast or famine’ pattern can make you more likely to grab something quick and high-carb by late morning, sending your blood sugar on a roller coaster of spiking and crashing,” says Reeder. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Breakfast eaters tend to have healthier weights and a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who frequently skip the morning meal,” says Reeder. According to a large systematic review, people who skip breakfast are 48% more likely to be overweight or obese and 31% more likely to have abdominal obesity than those who regularly eat breakfast.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you have type 2 diabetes, eating breakfast could provide major improvements, as skipping breakfast is related to higher A1C levels, a measure of long-term blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While breakfast itself is associated with better blood sugar management, not all meals are created equal. To make the most of your morning meal, follow these steps. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Start with Fiber-Rich Carbs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains and fruit are rich in carbs, but they’re also high in fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of glucose and supports a healthy gut microbiome. Instead of lower-fiber refined carbs like high-sugar cereal and pastries, choose whole-grain bread, oats or even baked goods made with whole-grain flours. For natural sweetness and an antioxidant boost, add fiber-rich fruits like berries, apples, pears and cherries to your plate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein helps you feel full while also slowing down the digestion of glucose, helping to avoid spikes and promote longer-lasting energy. One study found that a high-protein breakfast can suppress post-meal blood sugar levels compared to eating a low-protein breakfast.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Easy ways to add protein to your morning meal include low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese, lean meats, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds. Mix strained (such as Greek-style) yogurt into a parfait, stir nut butter into oatmeal, or toss some beans into a breakfast burrito to make your meal more filling and blood sugar–friendly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fats also slow digestion, which helps keep your blood sugar stable while adding flavor and satisfaction to your meal. Prioritize unsaturated fats, which support heart health and may offer some protection against insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Top toast with avocado, add nuts or seeds to oatmeal, or cook your eggs in olive oil for a boost of healthy fats.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat at regular intervals&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid going too long between meals to prevent extreme hunger and blood sugar dips and spikes. “Regular meals keep glucose entering the bloodstream in steady amounts, which helps your body use insulin more efficiently,” says Reeder. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful with portions&lt;/strong&gt;: How much you eat can be just as important as what you eat for managing your blood sugar. “A large amount of carbs at once can overwhelm your system, causing a surge in blood sugar,” says Reeder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk after eating&lt;/strong&gt;: Even just a few minutes of activity after a meal can lower blood sugar and prevent spikes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep and stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: Skimping on sleep and letting your stress get out of control can put your body in a chronic state of “fight or flight,” “Poor sleep and chronic stress both make your cells less responsive to insulin, which raises blood sugar,” says Reeder. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making time for a balanced breakfast supports energy levels, focus and steady blood sugar levels throughout the entire day, long after you’ve taken your last bite. “Breakfast can be one small but important step in protecting your metabolic health over time,” says Reeder. To make the most of your breakfast, balance fiber-rich carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats to keep your energy stable, reduce cravings and support long-term health.&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Ira Eliasoph retired from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eye-surgeon-starting-losing-sight-inspired-him-to-prevent-blindness-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; at 92, he still felt energized enough to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I quit, it was not because of any feebleness on my part; I could still do the surgery without having the shakes," Eliasoph, 96, told Business Insider. "The young residents were more nervous than I was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since retiring from a 70-year medical career that involved a naval rescue and celebrity patients, Eliasoph focused on painting, driving to see his friends, and participating in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.superagersstudy.org/en" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;SuperAgers Family Study&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/common-traits-supercentenarians-scientist-longevity-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity traits&lt;/a&gt; in people 95 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliasoph said his father, Dr. Benjamin Eliasoph, a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/06/09/84805521.html?pageNumber=41" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;renowned physician&lt;/a&gt; who pioneered the design of the oxygen tent in 1921, was his hero.

"The only real emergency is if the house is on fire," he said. "But otherwise, pretty much everything can wait a few hours or another day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's led to a long, rich life. "I'm glad that my brain seems to be clear," Eliasoph said. "I've had a couple of difficulties with some surgeries, whatever, but I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="be0f685c-f707-4b9e-b8a5-45a815825a5e" data-toc-id="be0f685c-f707-4b9e-b8a5-45a815825a5e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career passion and hobbies keep his mind sharp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

"Curiosity and observation every day are essential," Eliasoph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At summer sleepaway camp, he was eager to learn how to swim, ride a horse, row a boat, paddle a canoe, and shoot a rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following in his father's footsteps, Eliasoph entered the medical field, first studying general surgery before pursuing ophthalmology at NYU and Mount Sinai. "I chose a field that suited my talents and interests," he said, which kept him engaged and excited throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looks back on his career with pride. In 1955, he participated in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1956/03/31/archives/58-vessels-aided-by-navy-service-sea-transport-record-in-55.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;risky, lifesaving mission&lt;/a&gt; as a US Navy medical officer.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What you eat &amp;amp; drink before &amp;amp; after your flu shot can make a difference in how you feel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated, load up on antioxidant-rich foods and pack a snack before your shot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain hydration, eat for your symptoms and continue healthy habits after the shot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is estimated that at least 46 million Americans per year come down with the regular seasonal flu.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some cases are more severe than others, but make no mistake, flu season will arrive before we know it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In case you were wondering, the fall season is the best time to get a flu shot, to bolster your immune system before the virus season really gets into full swing as the weather turns cold. "The flu shot, in combination with hand-washing, is among our best defenses against this highly contagious, and potentially frustrating, infectious disease," explains &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jonathan%20W%20Yadlosky/1321671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jonathan Yadlosky, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; It is recommended that everyone age 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually, says &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/about-nfid/board-of-directors/patricia-a-stinchfield-ms-cpnp/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Patricia A. Stinchfield, RN, M.S., CPNP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You'll be protecting not only your own health, but also the health of those with whom you share a household, workplace or school, along with anyone you encounter as you go about your daily tasks and holiday gatherings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the potential for post-shot pain has you on the fence about getting a flu shot, we'll coach you through how to feel your best each step of the way. We've broken down a few specific tips to act as your pre-shot starter pack. But there's no need to wait until you have a &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine appointment&lt;/a&gt; (if you haven't booked one already) to start shifting your strategy, confirms &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Drink 16 Ounces More Water per Day &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No need to overhaul your entire meal plan, Yadlosky advises: "A healthy and balanced diet along with a slight increase in hydration is all someone will really need to be nutritionally prepared."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Staying hydrated is important to your overall health, and is a key thing to focus on when planning for your vaccine," Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking enough H2O helps your body maintain a normal temperature, which may be particularly helpful leading up to a flu shot since fever is a possible side effect. The amount of water you need varies based on a number of factors (here's a rough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;guideline for how much water you should drink&lt;/a&gt;), but "try to be intentional about drinking an extra glass or two of water each day leading up to your vaccine," Stinchfield adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find it challenging to meet your mark, there are a few things you can do to make it more enjoyable to up your intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry a water bottle with you and refill it throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infuse your water with citrus and/or herbs to perk up its flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a chic pitcher to keep within your line of sight when you open the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider adding some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; to your menu to supplement what you sip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prioritize Anti-Inflammatory Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there's no one recipe ingredient, vitamin or mineral that can prevent disease, there are some foods and nutrients that can help support your immune system so it can perform at its peak and is better able to do its important job of fighting off foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best ways to "feed" your immune system is to lean into more anti-inflammatory foods. Beyond acting as part of your immunity Rx, this will also help reduce inflammation in the body pre- and post- shot, Ehsani says. Over time, following an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce your risk for other chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, too. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595044/the-10-best-anti-inflammatory-foods-for-heart-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; may also help decrease &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7930160/inflammation-fatigue-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;feelings of fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and possibly reduce your risk for headaches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7965303/anti-inflammatory-comfort-food-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory comfort food meal plan&lt;/a&gt; is packed with fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats like fish and nuts, hearty whole grains and protein-packed beans, lentils and more. The comfort food factor will help calm any pre-shot stress, and the cozy recipes are ideal to savor as temperatures begin to dip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Aim for Balanced and Colorful Meals and Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It's important to note that the flu vaccine cannot cause flu illness. This is a common misconception. However, flu activity starts to ramp up in October and November, meaning it's a good time to give your immune system a boost with nutrient-rich meals at any time—and it's never too early to start this healthy strategy," Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the easiest ways to mix up your menu and maximize the amount of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants you're consuming is to focus on adding more color to your plate, Ehsani says. (BTW, we suggest adding these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918735/fall-superfoods-to-support-your-immune-system/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 fall superfoods&lt;/a&gt; to your shopping list, since they can support your immune system during cold and flu season.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Fruits and veggies are among our most nutrient-dense foods, and most Americans are not consuming enough of them," Ehsani explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Setting a goal to include at least three different natural colors on your plate at each meal will go a long way to help support an overall stoked and strong immune system. Bonus: Fruits and veggies are packed with water, so will help hydrate you pre- and post-shot too, Ehsani adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Pack a Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Receiving a flu vaccine can trigger anxiety among some individuals, Stinchfield says, which may, in turn, result in fainting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Having a snack and some water right before your vaccine has been shown to sometimes prevent anxiety-related fainting," she says. "Pack an easy snack and a water bottle just in case," to enjoy on your way to your flu shot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snag one of these healthy grab-and-go snacks, or whip up one of these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7824730/healthy-packable-snack-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;24 dietitian-approved homemade, packable snacks&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-after-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for After the Flu Shot &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Continue to Stay Hydrated &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A good balance of fluids and nutrients helps the immune system process the flu shot and begin to build protection, Yadlosky explains. Plus, one of the possible ripple effects of a flu shot is a slight headache. Being dehydrated can exacerbate said headache, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking adequate water (and a glass or two extra, if possible) the day before, the day of and the day after your flu shot is a good rule of thumb, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add in Some Prebiotics and Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The scientific jury is still out, but Manaker says that gut-healthy foods with pre- and probiotics may help make your vaccine more effective, according to some evidence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, yogurt, kefir and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; (such as kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha) to give your good gut bacteria a boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Stock Plain Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While rare and almost always mild, another side effect of the flu vaccine is nausea, so it's never a bad idea to be prepared for an upset stomach, Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There aren't any foods that are necessarily off-limits after getting a flu shot, says Manaker. However, pantry staples like saltine crackers, pasta, and rice are wise choices if you're experiencing any nausea, as are bananas and avocados. Check out our complete primer on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561593/easy-to-digest-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy-to-digest-foods—plus what to skip&lt;/a&gt; for when your stomach feels "off."

Additionally, pollutants may damage the cornea, leading to scarring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And reducing chemical contaminants by about 20 percent led to improvements in vision scores in children with mild myopia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe reducing pollution levels while children's eyes are vulnerable and developing could improve vision levels before severe, lasting disease begins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in China found environmental pollution contributed to myopia, or nearsightedness, in children (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Zongbo Shi, co-supervisor of the study and professor of atmospheric biogeochemistry at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/birmingham/index.html" id="mol-0eb8a370-9881-11f0-b8ad-d5409f3869ab"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, said: 'While genetics and screen time are long recognized as contributors to childhood myopia, this study is among the first to isolate air pollution as a meaningful and modifiable risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clean air isn’t just about respiratory health - it’s about visual health too. Our results show that improving air quality could be a valuable strategic intervention to protect children’s eyesight, especially during their most vulnerable developmental years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/9/pgaf279/8259670?searchresult=1#533024996"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 29,971 Chinese children in elementary, middle and high school, who were recruited between March 2021 and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (70 percent) were in elementary school, and 52 percent of participants were boys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two-thirds also had at least one parent with myopia, as genetics are a know risk factor, and 85 percent lived in urban areas, which generally have more pollution that rural neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also measured levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a group of microscopic particles that are emitted directly into the air from fossils fuels burned from factories and gasoline-powered stoves and cars, as well as burning wood in fireplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles are so small that they are blind to the eye and the nose and lungs can't filter them out, allowing them to travel to the bloodstream and induce widespread inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at nitrogen oxide (NO2), which is formed from fossil fuel combustion and released by vehicles, power plants and industrial processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, the researchers looked at China, which has a PM2.5 concentration six times greater than the World Health Organization's safe limit. It's also the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, producing about 27 percent of global emissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The team measured levels of NO2 and PM2.5, which are emitted through fossil fuels burned from factories and power plants. Pictured above is a cloud of pollution over Denver, Colorado (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows the improvement of children's uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) scores after researchers reduced pollution levels in a simulation. UCVA accounts of vision sharpness without corrective lenses &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 53 percent of participants were diagnosed with myopia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found younger age, parents having myopia and levels of NO2 and PM2.5 were the most significant drivers of myopia in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found environmental pollution was more closely related to myopia, while children with more access to green space had clearer vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 81 percent of cases of severe myopia were directly tied to non-modifiable risk factors like genetics and younger age, whereas environmental factors only contributed to 4.3 percent of severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, environmental factors explained 12 percent of mild myopia cases, and behavioral factors like sleep and the amount of time spent outside in green space accounted for 13.6 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found PM2.5 pollution was linked to 44 percent more myopia cases in milder disease versus more severe forms of myopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows levels of PM2.5 in each US state as of 2020, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows levels of PM2.5 in each US county as of 2020, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also used machine learning to simulate 'clean air' scenarios and measure the impacts of lower concentrations of air pollution. They found reducing NO2 and PM2.5 levels by 20 percent improved children's overall vision scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Thus, roughly one-quarter of the risk in [mild] myopia was attributable to modifiable influences, nearly double the relative contribution seen in high myopia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'This pattern indicates that in children with school myopia, differences in pollution exposure have a stronger impact on vision, whereas in severe myopia cases, vision impairment is mainly driven by demographic factors, leaving environmental influences less influential.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study co-author Dr Yuquing Dai of the University of Birmingham said: 'Myopia is on the rise globally, and it can lead to serious eye problems later in life. While we can’t change a child’s genes, we can improve their environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we act early - before severe myopia sets in - we can make a real difference.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:55:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNczVkMnBhSC01OERkaVpVRkExZ1h6MFNobWhWS2FYYXJiM3Nyb2dXdVQwU0Qxcy10cFNDUFlLUzhDc3ZHWUM4dVdUeTN0dnFDS2Q2TVdUUXZ4Zm45SzIzMnIzQ2xNRE1sa2RKS1FkMVZqZTFyZjRCWkhhSUs2R1JQREZOOWh6Q1dRQ2ozYTZuRUFNZDRkMzk1cTU0aHFvZWkt0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1BYmVwZm1yOEpnQlpMN283bUlrRUdTQThoeFhwRk9QTTFudWhYakVGcTdDa0cwM0pJMHpBZENsV2NsMVZmZUppSEI3ZkMtenR6azRtdnZva1FFYlZWUWNVbkRNbDFHeS1mYW03d3JxbFoxeFNXZXFmZFVsSnIyN2huZ2xDbkwxbjQwcXZNQlFfelNFUGwxd29GTXZMaFhmbDc4WWU3V1E</guid></item></channel></rss>
