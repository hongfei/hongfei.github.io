				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; announced that 11 children are hospitalized with measles, three of whom are in a serious condition, as of Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the hospitalized children had been fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the measles outbreak, 48 have been hospitalized, 40 of whom have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures raise concern within the health system, partly because the amount of reported cases likely only represents a portion of the virus's actual spread among the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior health officials also warn of a potential mass infection at the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/lag-baomer"&gt;Lag Ba'omer&lt;/a&gt; Mount Meron pilgrimage, as vaccination rates in certain haredi (ultra-Orthodox) communities remain very low.&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Highly contagious disease. Child with measles. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry held urgent discussions with representatives from health maintenance organizations, and following consultations, decided to advance the timing of the second measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/vaccine"&gt;vaccine dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was previously given to children at six years old, but will now be administered in areas with active cases or heightened outbreak risk, starting from one month after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is measles? Symptoms and treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-851840"&gt;Measles is an acute viral disease&lt;/a&gt;, highly contagious and transmitted through airborne respiratory droplets. Its infection rate is considered among the highest of viral illnesses, with an unvaccinated person exposed to a patient having about a 90% chance of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after infection and include high fever, runny nose, fatigue, conjunctivitis, dry cough, and a characteristic rash spreading from the face to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients recover within a few days, but the disease can complicate into pneumonia, ear infections, liver damage, and rarely, acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months and sometimes years after infection, a severe chronic nervous system disorder called SSPE (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis) can develop. This is a progressive, incurable degenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, movement disorders, neurological seizures, and death. SSPE’s estimated incidence is about 1 in 10,000 cases, but the risk is significantly higher in infants under one year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include decreased consciousness, vomiting, light sensitivity, and neck stiffness&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Cases of the measles rise in Israel. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing dedicated vaccination centers nationwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Health Ministry opened dedicated vaccination centers nationwide that allow walk-in immunizations without appointments. The ministry urges the public to check the list of centers on its website and to arrive up to 30 minutes before closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of children under six are asked to complete the vaccination series with the “Tipat Halav” (maternal and child health clinics), while children over seven can be vaccinated at the new centers or health funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is included in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) combination and is generally administered in two doses: at one year and six years of age. However, due to the current outbreak, the ministry is advancing the second dose in defined areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults born after 1957 who are unsure of their vaccination status are asked to check their records and complete vaccination if necessary. The ministry notes that people born before 1957 are generally considered immune, having likely been exposed to the virus during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women who are unvaccinated, infants, and immunocompromised individuals may also require passive immunization with antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors worldwide have noted a decline in vaccination rates since the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend affecting Israel as well. Avoidance of routine vaccinations combined with rising vaccine skepticism has created susceptible populations lacking immunity, leading to recurring measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and adults unsure of their vaccination status can contact their health fund nurse or the Health Ministry’s hotline by dialing *5400. The ministry also recommends that any traveler abroad who has not received two measles vaccine doses get vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to recognize signs of measles infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles infection often begins with a seven to 14-day incubation period. General symptoms during the first stage of infection include a high fever, runny nose, severe fatigue, dry cough, and eye inflammation. During the second stage, more unique symptoms, such as small white spots on a red background inside the cheeks, known as Koplik spots, sometimes appear before the rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third stage is the rash appearing, including a dense red rash starting on the face, before spreading to the neck, torso, arms, and legs. The rash often lasts between four and seven days, and may be accompanied by significant weight loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible complications from a measles infection include pneumonia, ear infections, diarrhea, and acute encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avihai Chiim contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We talked about the Manet exhibition we had just seen at the National Gallery. We probably talked about how the end of the cold war might affect the chances of Bill Clinton winning the presidential election against George HW Bush in November. I know what John thought about that. I only wish I could recall his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The next morning, 30 July 1992, John got up before me as he always did. In the kitchen I found the contents of the dishwasher – knives, forks, spoons, plates, mugs – jumbled together on the table. This was odd because unloading the dishwasher was the one domestic ritual he willingly performed. It would be years before I learned the reason. At the time I put it down to absent-mindedness. It was a month since he had delivered a book to the publisher and he was already preoccupied by the next one, about art in the European Renaissance. Before I had time to be annoyed, I heard a crash from his study at the top of the house. I ran upstairs and found him lying on the floor next to his desk. He looked up at me with the radiant, witless smile of a baby. And he said: “Da walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/stroke","type":"Keyword","title":"Stroke"},{"id":"news/series/the-long-read","type":"Series","title":"The long read"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/physiotherapists","type":"Keyword","title":"Physiotherapists"},{"id":"science/neuroscience","type":"Keyword","title":"Neuroscience"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/the-long-read","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"The Long Read"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/long-read","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Long Read"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/15/husband-son-stroke-30-years-apart-treatment","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"abPrebidId5":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"europeBetaFrontTest2":false,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"dcrJavascriptBundle":false,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"abA9BidResponseWinner":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"lineItemJobs":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":false,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ambulance took us to the local hospital where they said that my husband had had cerebral accident – a stroke. The cause was probably years of uncontrolled high blood pressure, about which no doctor had warned him. They said he needed rest and reassurance. Unfortunately, because of the so-called efficiency savings introduced by John Major’s government, there was a shortage of beds and of nurses in all London hospitals. I was so grateful when they found a bed for him in a geriatric ward later in the day that I didn’t at first notice how filthy it was and how hot. The floor was covered in urine, blood and dust balls. (Later I brought in a mop to clean around John’s bed.) The plateglass window could not be opened: to prevent suicides, a passing nurse told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a week before I managed to track down the doctor whose name was printed on a grimy card at the head of John’s bed. The doctor informed me that my husband’s case was hopeless. He would never walk again and must never be allowed to try to stand because the hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall. Physiotherapy, which the doctor considered “about as useful as peanut butter”, was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;You learn fast in an emergency. John had had an ischaemic stroke, which is a blockage in one of the arteries that carries blood to the brain, resulting in the death of brain tissue. It was in his left brain, which controls the right limbs and, in most people, the processing of language. About 75% of people will survive a first stroke. But it is essential to get them up and standing as soon as possible, and paralysed limbs should be moved to prevent the muscles from seizing up permanently. Visiting family and friends were happy to help, moving John’s arms and legs while they sat with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;John greeted everyone with those two meaningless syllables, &lt;em&gt;da walls. &lt;/em&gt;He also used the same sounds to ask them questions about themselves: “Walls? Da walls?” He chatted away in his usual sociable manner with his fellow patients, and even charmed the few overworked nurses. The rise and fall, the rhythms and pitch of his voice were so normal that those of us who knew him well understood at least the gist of what he was not saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since he could read, we assumed he could also write; he was after all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/13/guardianobituaries1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a writer.&lt;/a&gt; We gave him a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen, which he seized in his good left hand, and, on the top left corner of the page he wrote the letter “f” and then gave up. John had what is called expressive aphasia. Although he could tell that we didn’t understand him, it felt to him as though he was translating his thoughts as effectively and comprehensibly as ever into words. I was only one of the many people who had a recurring dream that John had suddenly started to talk normally. As one friend said, it was as if he were under a magic spell and, like all magic spells, it would be lifted as suddenly as it came on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he neurologists and clinicians who specialise in stroke talk a lot about pathways. There are the pathways of neurons and synapses that are interrupted by a clot or haemorrhage, pathways from the onset of symptoms to hospital. Although the consequences of a stroke do not necessarily get worse over time, the pathway to recovery is problematic, as I was to discover. My own pathway towards an understanding of what stroke is and does, and how it can be addressed, began in that unclean geriatric ward where the doctor condemned his stroke patients to live diminished lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My concern at the time was to escape from that hospital to a place that would help my husband. The Wolfson neurorehabilitation centre at Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon, which had an excellent reputation for stroke rehabilitation, did not admit patients over 65 on the NHS. They would, however, accept John privately – at a price that would have meant selling our house. With some difficulty, I found a bed in a hospital at the other end of London. It was at least clean. And although there was no physiotherapy available, the nurses, immediately on John’s arrival, got him up on his feet and limping, with their support, up and down the ward. All too soon they informed me that they would have to discharge him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then I found that John’s service in the second world war entitled him to a place in the Royal Star &amp;amp; Garter for Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen. A large and handsome building, overlooking the Thames from the brow of Richmond Hill, it had been purpose built for the care and rehabilitation of servicemen and women disabled in the first world war. (It has now, perhaps inevitably, been converted into luxury flats.) It was staffed by neurophysiotherapists, occupational therapists and a speech therapist. The physios worked on restoring not just movement of the affected limbs but movement that was as normal as possible. The physios walked him through parallel bars, guiding his bad leg into a correct position with their hands, running their hands up his spine to remind him to stand up straight. They got him to put his full weight on one leg while swinging the other. They made him do squats, holding his limp arm stretched forward with his good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b7e2c45e-863c-4c3c-b3a8-93733aa182d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sheila and John Hale. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When John came home at Easter after six months of intensive physiotherapy, he was able to dress himself and care for his personal needs. He was still limping but he was so much stronger that he walked around the house without a stick and climbed the stairs to his study. He was, however, liable to trip and fall because he had no control over his right foot. Then I heard, only by chance, that a rigid brace fitted on his foot underneath the shoe would solve that problem. Now he began to take himself on ever longer walks around the neighbourhood, chatting in those meaningless syllables with the neighbours, making new friends in the pub. We travelled, to Italy and farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ix months after the stroke, John’s vocabulary had not changed, and I was determined to find out how he might recover his use of language. The speech therapist at the Star &amp;amp; Garter had quickly given up on John: “You will never again have a conversation with your husband.” Her patronising pronouncement filled me with an energising rage that set me on a new pathway: to find out as much as I could about aphasia, and to prove her wrong about John’s case. My instinct as a journalist was to seek out expert specialists in the field; and I was not surprised to discover that the more experienced they were, the less likely they were to make predictions about John’s, or anyone else’s, chances of recovery. The people who know most about the way the brain works know that it is terra incognita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39b2b35f-a50d-48df-acf0-d888e43e8206" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;John Hale in Venice, February 1992.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Quill&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I found two speech therapists, Jane Marshall and Eirian Jones. Watching them work with John taught me so much about language, and what the loss of it tells us about normal language, that I began to plan a book about the condition (which is better known as dysphasia, rather than aphasia, because it is rare that all the elements of language are lost). I will mention here only one of Jones’s many discoveries about John’s particular case because it explains the mystery of the way he unloaded the dishwasher on the morning of his stroke. Jones’s theory was that John had lost the ability to “disambiguate” the various different contents of the dishwasher. And in the same way he could no longer unravel the elements of a sentence. So although John could write individual words, matching the correct word to a picture or filling in the missing word in a story, he had, as Jones put it, no idea of what a sentence was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On 13 September 1998, six years after the stroke, there was a stupendous breakthrough. John indicated to me that he wanted to write a thank you note to a friend who had given us lunch in his office. He got out one of his correspondence cards headed Professor Sir John Hale, and on it he wrote: “Dear David”. I said, Fine, now what is the expression of gratitude you need? John wrote: “Thanks you for lunch.” I said: Do you want to say where? John wrote: “in your office”. When? “On Thursday.” Then he wrote without prompting: “I have”. And I stupidly said, now you need either a verb or a noun. But he wrote “certainly” and laughed and finished the letter by himself: “been in luck! Yours ever, John.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I telephoned Eirian with the news. She was pleased but reminded me that it wasn’t quite the breakthrough I had initially thought – I had, in fact, guided John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went to the US to research my book on dysphasia. Back home I told John about all the people I had interviewed, one of them being Alfonso Caramazza, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Harvard. On 9 August 1999, I went out shopping. When I returned I found on John’s desk a scrap of paper on which he had written:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramagne,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thanks you for agreeing to advice Sheila to carre on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next to the draft was one of his correspondence cards on which he had written (note the style, one professor to another):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramazza,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thank you for agreeing to advise Sheila to carry on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nobody was with him. Nobody prompted or guided him or even suggested he write to Caramazza, about whom I hadn’t spoken for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I will never know how much more John would have written, because on the morning of 12 August he died peacefully in his sleep next to me in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;y book, The Man Who Lost His Language, was published in 2003. For the third edition in 2006, the publisher asked for a new chapter about any recent changes in stroke care. All my contacts led me straight to one man: Dr Tony Rudd, consultant stroke physician at St Thomas’ hospital in central London. Rudd was better known in medical and government circles as “Dr Stroke” for his tireless campaigning to get the message across that stroke, like heart attack, is both a medical emergency and a treatable illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I asked him what changes he had seen in the 14 years since John’s stroke. “There has been more progress with stroke than with any other illness,” he said. “But we started from nothing. And there are still black holes.” The failure to treat stroke properly from day one continued to be a massive waste of public money. Without treatment, the survivors will be a burden on the NHS and the welfare budget. It is not only they who will remain helpless and unproductive. Their carers, usually unpaid younger relatives, will also be unable to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But lassitude was giving way to excitement with the development of techniques which restore the flow of blood to the brain (known as reperfusion), in time to limit much of the damage caused by ischaemic stroke. Rudd had begun a programme of injecting suitable patients with a clot-busting drug. The technique, thrombolysis, is by no means suitable for every stroke. And because brain cells die in their millions during a stroke, treatment should be delivered as soon as possible, preferably within four hours. Thrombolysis was first used in the UK in the 1990s. Rudd’s hospital was the first that was equipped to deliver it to all suitable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A cheerful young Scottish nurse told me that whereas stroke used to be “the dead end of nursing”, the opportunity to give quality care to people who might otherwise have died or been permanently disabled was so rewarding that she had decided to devote her career to caring for stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went away that day daring to hope that stroke treatment, which was underserved by an underfunded, over-bureaucratised health system, might receive the attention it deserved. In 2010, following recommendations by Lord Ara Darzi, eight specialised services for stroke treatment, known as Hyper Acute Stroke Units, were established across London. Six years later, St George’s hospital in Tooting, south London, was the first of them to perform thrombectomy, which mechanically removes clots too big to respond to clot-busting drugs. This continues to be the most effective procedure and allows almost half of those treated to return to their normal life within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t 11:10am on Sunday 21 November 2021 I had a telephone call from my daughter-in-law Amanda. My son Jay, who was then 55, had fallen out of bed earlier that morning. Amanda knew it was a stroke because Jay had inherited his father’s high blood pressure, along with his insouciance about his health. She rang 999 only to be told that there would be no ambulance for four hours. A kind neighbour who is, as it happened, a doctor drove them through red lights to the nearest stroke unit. Amanda was informed that Jay was not a suitable candidate for reperfusion because the stroke had happened in his sleep and they couldn’t therefore determine whether too much time had elapsed for treatment to be effective. This was incorrect. Since Jay went to sleep at 11pm and reached the unit by 4:30am he was in good time. No doubt the hospital was overwhelmed by Covid. What happened afterwards, however, was less forgivable; nor, alas, is it an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dfb9e2da-0a36-4586-bc89-87077e590720" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jay Hale.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jay was given a bed in a dedicated stroke ward. It was immaculately clean. (The lesson of the MRSA epidemics in dirty wards had been learned.) His was a right-brain stroke paralysing his left arm and leg and affecting his left field of vision, but sparing his language. The consultants who visited him in the ward predicted, presumably on the evidence of a brain scan, that he was unlikely to walk again. Although Jay was fully conscious and able to speak normally, the consultants also informed him that he would never work again. He must under no circumstances be permitted to stand up without the help of physiotherapists, who were scarce and clocked off at 4pm. The hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall and private physiotherapy was not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without the support of his family and many friends Jay might well have given in to the despair that afflicts so many stroke survivors. He couldn’t believe what had happened to him. But he was also determined to prove that the doctors were mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike his father all those years ago, Jay was allowed small doses of physio and occupational therapy every now and then. When they had time, the physios put him on a reclining static bicycle which he enjoyed because he had always been a keen cyclist, and which encouraged him to move the bad leg by pumping with the good one. After a few weeks, he charmed two of the physios into helping him to stand up and take a step, then two steps, then walk the length of the ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Jay was discharged after four months in hospital he mostly used a wheelchair, although he was able to walk around the house with a four-legged stick. He had been warned by the hospital that he must never, ever rely on a single stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Amanda enrolled him in a private rehabilitation practice in west London run by a renowned physiotherapist named Richard Sealy. Sealy asked Jay what he wanted most to achieve, and when Jay said he wanted to walk without a stick Sealy said: “Well then do it.” Jay took a few steps. In 25 years of practice Sealey has treated 4,000 patients, including the journalist Andrew Marr after his stroke. Over the next 18 months, I watched this charming and dedicated man and his team of neurophysios and occupational therapists working with Jay to reconnect the pathways between the motor cortex of his right brain with his left leg and arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First, they got him to walk chest forward and head up – with, and then without, a stick. They tried to play football as a way of encouraging an instinct to kick. He tried to put weight and balance on his bad leg and kicking with the good one; or, and this was much harder, balance on the good leg and kick with the bad one. He did one-legged squats. He used a pilates reformer and walked on a treadmill. They timed him as he walked as fast as he could around the building, each time beating his previous record. In an attempt to wake up his left hand and arm they clasped the hand around his precious phone, hoping to trigger the instinctive grasp to stop it dropping. They tried video games played with his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By no means everybody could afford Sealy’s fees (£110 for 45 minutes). Sealy regrets leaving the NHS, where he was trained and which he says still provides the best training for physiotherapists in the world. If there is a shortage of neurotherapists in the NHS, he said, the reason they leave is less about pay than about the long hours of intensive therapy they are not allowed to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I remain haunted by the people who miss out on precious rehab. Each one of &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1.3 million stroke survivors&lt;/a&gt; in the UK has a story. Last year there were &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/11/hospital-admissions-for-strokes-rise-by-28-since-2004-as-nhs-urges-the-public-to-act-fast/#:~:text=NHS%20England%20data%20shows%20an,on%20the%20nation's%20cardiovascular%20health." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;111,137 stroke admissions to NHS hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, a rise of 28% in 10 years, and this &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/26/unsustainable-uk-predicted-to-see-50-spike-in-strokes-by-2035" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;figure is expected to rise&lt;/a&gt; dramatically. Meanwhile, 39% of stroke patients are abandoned by the NHS after six months. A third remain too disabled to work, many because they believed, or had no choice but to believe, the doctors who wrote off their chances of recovery. The population of stroke survivors is as big as that of a large city, and it’s getting bigger. More than half are left with a disability and about a third are unable to live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nor, as many young people like to imagine, is stroke a faraway illness that happens in the never-never land of old age. A quarter of people who experience strokes are under the age of 65. And in the past 10 years there has been a 55% increase in strokes among people, like my son Jay, in their 50s, which is the highest increase among any age group. The reasons may be bad diet – ultra processed food and especially sugary drinks, which are as dangerous as smoking – and uncontrolled blood pressure. The poorest members of society suffer strokes seven years earlier than the better off. Some are small strokes. They may recover spontaneously in a few weeks but even small strokes may be warnings of worse to come. Many will have lost the use of an arm and a leg, a field of vision, the production or comprehension of language. They might suffer from apraxia, an inability to sequence movements in the order it requires to perform everyday tasks. Some will find it difficult to recognise what they see, touch, hear or taste, an impairment of sensory processing known as agnosia. Visual agnosia was made famous by Oliver Sacks in his classic book &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/17/profile-oliver-sacks-author-neurologist" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/a&gt;. Others will suffer from anosognosia, a denial of their own symptoms. Every stroke is different and every brain has been conditioned by a unique set of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5f442e65-69d8-4201-b11d-d67a6500a923" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&amp;quot;richLinkIndex&amp;quot;:43,&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;prefix&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Related: &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;'Is anybody in there?'

For those who need an economic justification, a 10-year study published in 2016 and led by Prof Lynne Turner-Stokes at King’s College hospital has demonstrated that intensive therapy for all neurological illnesses saves the cost of long term care and improves the rate of productivity. This is why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) now recommends a minimum of three hours of intensive therapy at least five days a week. Yet at present, most NHS stroke units provide two or three hours of physiotherapy a week, with a six-month time-limit. Nick Ward, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, an ardent defender of rehabilitation after stroke, described this as “a homeopathic dose, not worth the cost”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why does the UK waste lives and taxpayers’ money by condemning stroke survivors to dependent, unproductive lives? Three and a half years after his stroke, my son is a living example of what can be achieved by physiotherapy, and why it is so important that more people have access to it. The hole in his brain is much bigger than it would have been if he had been treated on arrival at the stroke unit, instead of being told he was not eligible. Nevertheless, thanks to intensive neurophysiotherapy, Jay now climbs up and down two flights of stairs to their bedroom at the top of the house. He dresses and washes himself, walks around the house without a stick, around London with only a single stick, gets on and off buses and trains. He has returned to teaching mathematics, five days a week, at the school where he worked before the stroke. He swims at the local gym, where he has taught the personal trainer some of the techniques of neurophysiotherapy. Not only does he lead an independent and productive life, he is still, three and a half years post-stroke, getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPY1c0NURmVmROY1hkUkV4LXNzZ0pvXzREemI3ckZadC03T1REQXdEVk9QOHJ4TXlHM0JKMEFmREItd0ZmY1Zsa0p3Q3l0a2xWTHlMVG1uOXNlSXpjcENQUnVpX2N6QnpIalFJcDJDMmxxRGtWaW1RallieG1tYTkzYzAzN2ktbmJFWklsRG8waWtOcDZfSWc</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示药丸中隐藏的毒素会引发突发心脏病--《每日邮报》 | Doctor reveals hidden toxin in pills that trigger sudden heart attacks - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPTl8zU3ZVU3BKTXVfS2s5UHhZZkxqN0Z4aDJIYWowX0VuTW5CY1ZZSzhpZGxNeEhJRUg5bFFzSG93NHBPVno1NkJGaWstanZicEdJZkpoNXd6NGdpTERPb2ZBUVo4SzJxbnVfVHFSdlhFcS1rSTI2Z0xkaEdZSkVjUm9XQWZQdF9IRWcyQjYzMzJsMUJQTUhuZHNwc05pVmdzT3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

They are commonly used for pain relievers, multivitamins, stool softeners, and cough and cold medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unknown how many Americans take such capsules, the US soft gel capsules market was valued at $2.14 billion in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top heart doctor has revealed the insidious chemical in medicine capsules that could increase your risk of a heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Phthalates [can] increase inflammation and an important risk for heart disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Environmental Pollution study found phthalate exposure was associated with a slightly higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the urine samples of 5,300 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 years old from 2001 to 2010 and tracked causes of death among.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed among the 100,000 people who died during the study period, the ones with higher levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to have died from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted further research is needed to understand the exact ink between phthalate exposure and heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Dr Levine, exposure to phthalates - especially through pills - can cause swelling and irritation in&lt;span&gt; the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can lead them to narrow or harden, potentially causing blockages or aneurysms - ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, forming plaques, along the artery walls, but excessive intake of phthalates can also lead to this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Softgel capsule shells are made of phthalates - making it easier for manufacturers to mold the capsules into their own desired shape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim the chemicals also cause oxidative stress, a type of cell and tissue damage caused by an imbalance of molecules in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to damage in the heart cells, which can impair their function and contribute to inflammation, as well harden artery walls - increasing the risk for a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, phthalates can negatively impact cholesterol levels and potentially increase levels of triglycerides - a type of fat known to cause heart attacks - and low-density lipoproteins in the organ - making a person more susceptible to strokes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your cup of coffee has health benefits, but it also interacts with some medications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee may affect how a medication is absorbed, metabolized or removed from the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An expert shares the seven drugs, like asthma and cold medications, that interact with coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the majority of people, coffee is part of their daily routine. It provides the energy boost you need to kick-start your day (hello, caffeine!), and boasts &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt; as well. The only drawback to your morning cup of joe is that it may not mix well with certain medications, especially if you take them earlier in the day.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many different ways coffee may interact with some medications. “Coffee can alter how certain medications are absorbed, metabolized or eliminated by the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjenbourgeois/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jennifer Bourgeois, Pharm.D&lt;/a&gt;. “It can speed up gastric emptying, causing the medication to move through your system before it’s fully absorbed. It also competes with medications that rely on liver enzymes like CYP1A2, potentially increasing or decreasing drug levels in the bloodstream.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you have to give up coffee completely, but you may need to adjust the timing of taking your medications and sipping on your coffee. Read on to find out which medications an expert warns may interact with your morning cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your doctor has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902827/foods-to-eat-for-better-mental-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prescribed an antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll want to make sure you aren’t drinking coffee too soon after taking one of these medications because it can make them not work as well as they’re supposed to. For example, the caffeine in coffee can form a complex with the antidepressant drug escitalopram (Lexapro), making it harder for your body to absorb the medication. Since less of the drug is absorbed, it may be less effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other antidepressants like clomipramine and imipramine are broken down by the same enzyme (called CYP1A2) as caffeine. So if you’re taking these medications with coffee, they may not be metabolized as quickly, which can lead to higher levels of the drug in your blood for a longer period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, this interaction could increase the effects of caffeine, leaving you feeling jittery and restless. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-thyroid-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Thyroid Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck) doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Without adequate hormone levels, you may start to experience excessive tiredness, joint and muscle pain, depression or weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bourgeois explains that the absorption of levothyroxine, used to treat hypothyroidism, can be significantly reduced by coffee. In fact, some studies found that it reduces your absorption of the medication by as much as 50%. “This may lead to inconsistent thyroid levels and persistent symptoms like fatigue or brain fog,” says Bourgeois. “That’s why patients are advised to wait 30 to 60 minutes before drinking coffee after taking thyroid medications.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-osteoporosis-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Osteoporosis Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications used to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;treat osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, like risedronate and alendronate, shouldn’t be taken with coffee. “Whether it’s caffeinated, decaf or even just milk or juice, these can all reduce absorption due to how the medication binds and dissolves. The safest practice is always to take this medication with plain water only,” says Bourgeois.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

Cold &amp;amp; Allergy Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is a nasal decongestant that can be purchased over the counter to help treat a stuffy nose from the common cold or allergies. Like caffeine, pseudoephedrine is also a stimulant. So when taken together with coffee, it may compound the side effects, making you feel more jittery and restless.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Those with diabetes should be extra cautious when consuming caffeine on this medication—some studies found that combining the two can raise blood sugar and increase body temperature.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-antipsychotic-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Antipsychotic Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who take antipsychotic medications like phenothiazine, clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine may need to adjust the timing of their morning coffee. Coffee can interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, clozapine competes with coffee to be broken down by liver enzymes. If the medication can’t be metabolized, it becomes less efficient. A study found that the plasma concentration of clozapine was increased by 97% after taking it with 2 to 3 cups of coffee (about 400 milligrams of caffeine). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have asthma, a condition that can make your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826579/healthy-lungs-food/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;airways inflamed and irritated&lt;/a&gt;, your health care provider may prescribe a bronchodilator like aminophylline or theophylline. These medications relax the muscles in your airways, making it easier to breathe. Common side effects of this medication include nausea, headache, restlessness and irritability. Consuming too much caffeine (from coffee, tea or energy drinks) can increase the side effects you may experience while taking this medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood-thinning medications are often recommended for those who may be at risk for blood clots after surgery or have certain heart or blood conditions. Since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blood-thinners-and-leafy-greens-8584000" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;these medications&lt;/a&gt; prevent blood from clotting, the most common side effect is the risk of bleeding. Taking these medications with coffee is risky since the caffeine in coffee can also slow blood clotting, which further increases your risk of bleeding or bruising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, research has found that coffee can lower the pH in your stomach, which can increase the absorption time of other blood thinners like aspirin. Since it’s absorbed faster, more is available to the body all at once, which can enhance the potential for bleeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us look forward to sipping on that first cup of coffee in the morning. While coffee is associated with plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-health-benefit-of-coffee-study-11726744" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth double-checking that it isn’t interfering with any of your medications. Reviewing this list is a good place to start. If you’re on one of these medications, you may need to adjust the timing of your coffee and medications. However, if you have specific questions about potential food or beverage interactions with your medications, be sure to check in with your health care provider.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers identified the EspW mutation by comparing the genetic sequences of 729 isolates of the new &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strain—dubbed REPEXH01—to genetic sequences of 2,027 other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 isolates. Of the 729 REPEXH01 strains, all but two had a single nucleotide deletion in EspW (the remaining two had ambiguous sequences), while the deletion was present in less than 4 percent of the non-REPEXH01 &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains. The finding suggests the tiny change could be a genetic signature of the strain, and its persistence in a key disease protein may offer the strain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's unclear what that advantage might be. The deletion of a single DNA base (an adenine) shifts the frame of the three-sequence protein code for the rest of EspW. This could result in a shorter protein. It could also cause the molecular machinery that translates the genetic code to slip, leading to proteins of various lengths. In any case, the deletion is likely to result in a less fully functional EspW protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers suggest this could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;when it's on lettuce and other produce. For example, EspW might spur an immune response from an infected plant that causes stomata—pores on the surfaces of leaves—to close, blocking the bacteria's ability to invade. Thus, cutting back EspW may help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;sneak in—an adaptation in the ongoing arms race between the bacteria and its host. Another possibility is that EspW could function like HopW1, leading to more severe infection in plant tissues, which could lower the chances that those infected leaves are harvested and make it to grocery stores and atop burgers. Thus, cutting back on EspW could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; move to its human victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, additional research will be needed to understand what's going on. As the CDC researchers conclude: "the role of the single base pair mutation in this strain’s colonization and survival on leafy vegetables could yield valuable insights."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants their child to get measles,” warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt; of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses—typically administered at ages 1 and 4—offer up to 97% protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feeling persistently exhausted or being in a constant state of low energy may be due to a mini-stroke you had without realizing, a study suggests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, some have reported continued challenges including reduced quality of life, thinking problems, depression, anxiety and fatigue.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed 354 people with an average age of 70 who had a mini-stroke for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete questionnaires about their level of fatigue in the first two weeks after a mini-stroke and again at three, six and 12 months later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers looked at how many participants experienced fatigue by defining it as a score of 12 or higher. Those being analyzed also underwent had brain scans to check for blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts discovered that 61 percent of those surveyed experienced increases in their fatigue scores two weeks after the mini-stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half reported fatigue at the three, six and 12 month mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists also found that participants who reported feeling fatigued were twice as likely to have a history of anxiety and/or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said that the study was observational and cannot prove that the mini-strokes were behind the persistent fatigue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Modrau said: 'Long-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found if people experience fatigue within two weeks after leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised that experts need to focus on whether mini-stroke patients are showing signs of fatigue and provide adequate care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For future studies, people diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack should be followed in the weeks and months that follow to be assessed for lingering fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care,' he concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has been published today in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not as extensively as a complete stroke, a mini stroke can cause a certain degree of brain damage when it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damage can leave a person with muscle weakness, difficulty with coordination and a general sense of weariness - which are all signs of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatigue is medically described as the persistent and excessive feeling of tiredness or lack of energy which interferes with daily activities, even after adequate rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particularly, physical fatigue can include muscle weakness, aches, pain, gastrointestinal issues and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While mental fatigue entails difficulty concentrating, learning new tasks, slowed reflexes and impaired decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain damage due to a mini-stroke can also change sleeping patterns, emotional distress and memory, all of which can contribute to ongoing tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That estimate accounts for gases released when companies drill for oil and gas, transport it to refineries, turn it into plastic and mold it into products.

Later, they die and sink — or they get eaten and pooped out by other sea creatures — falling to the bottom of the ocean in a constant flurry of organic material called “marine snow.” When marine snow settles to the bottom of the sea, it &lt;a href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/how-the-ocean-works/cycles/biological-carbon-pump-ocean-topic/"&gt;locks away carbon&lt;/a&gt; for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G4NHDVJVXT0VF20PAE7VNUTMYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But plastic can &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2478475-microplastics-could-be-hampering-the-oceans-ability-to-capture-carbon/"&gt;gum up the works&lt;/a&gt; by slowing plankton’s growth, making the little critters more buoyant so they don’t sink, or breaking up fish poop in a way that makes it less likely to settle at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YEWZBNRD92GV9P15KP1XGBWAG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s been shown that plastics can mess up the fecal pellets of these animals that are crucial for sequestering carbon in the ocean,” said Tracy Mincer, an associate professor at Florida Atlantic University who published a paper showing that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08818-1"&gt;5 percent of marine snow&lt;/a&gt; in the deep sea is now made of plastic. “But as far as how much … we’re still trying to figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DMCPBQKH6H333FU138JAHN5F8C" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the soil, plastic changes the way microbes store and release carbon, which could also warm the planet, although Kaufman said there’s not enough research yet to say how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="A5QHQB76VN47D0YUPP6XWGNR3R" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="A5QHQB76VN47D0YUPP6XWGNR3R" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How plastics may affect the Earth’s reflectivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XC4BVFCKKH1D74RUA4GQKD71YM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Normally, light-colored and reflective surfaces such as snow, ice and clouds reflect the sun’s energy back into space, keeping the Earth from warming up too much.

Once known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can lead to metabolic dysregulation, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. This advanced stage of the condition is called metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the condition's prevalence, only one drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat MASH, and it doesn't work well for everyone. So now, in a new study, scientists are exploring the effects of a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Fusarium foetens &lt;/em&gt;and their therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unique effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; are truly miraculous," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Changtao Jiang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor and deputy dean in the School of Basic Medical Sciences at Peking University in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

However, little was known about the specific microorganisms and molecules involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although gut bacteria have been studied more deeply, little is known about gut fungi. That's partly because gut fungi have diverse and complex nutritional needs, making them hard to grow in the lab, and samples are easily contaminated because the fungal spores are airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gut fungi are often termed the 'dark matter' of the intestinal microecosystem," Jiang told Live Science by email. But in their latest work, the researchers not only identified how &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;affects MASH&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but also pinpointed the molecules and metabolites involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the fungus, the researchers collected fecal samples from 100 people across five regions of China. They used a special system to grow the fungi within each sample in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system aims to mimic a real gut "as much as possible," Jiang said. It involves immersing small chips in fecal extract. Each chip contains chambers filled with a Jell-O-like substance infused with extracts from the fecal samples. Each chamber is capped with a membrane designed to allow nutrients from poo into the diffusion chamber without letting microbes escape through the same pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system was a "clever cultivation" technique for isolating different species of fungus, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" target="_blank" data-url="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kim Lewis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology at Northeastern University who specializes in microbiome therapeutics and was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing samples from China, the team studied published data from other studies of intestinal fungi that used volunteers in eight other countries. This enabled them to identify the most common fungal strains found in the gut, not only in China but worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering data from around the world helped ensure the samples covered a broad range of diets and environmental exposures, as both factors shape the gut microbiome. "Urban residents typically exhibit lower gut microbiota diversity compared to rural residents," Jiang noted, "likely due to reduced contact with natural environments and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased antibiotic use&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fungi spread through the air, the researchers compared fungal communities grown from air and from intestinal samples to spot those likely to be contaminants. The team also tested how well the fungal strains withstood the temperature of the gut — around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) — and the lack of oxygen found in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these experiments, the researchers found that across all of the fecal samples,&lt;em&gt; F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; stood out as the most common strain that was likely to thrive in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronauts to grow livers in space, where microgravity might help them thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;could influence fatty liver disease, the researchers administered the fungus to mice for two weeks. The rodents had been fed a high-fat diet designed to trigger MASH symptoms. Although the weight of the treated mice was comparable to that of the mice not given the fungus, the weight of their livers was less. The treated mice also had less liver inflammation and fibrosis and lower levels of chemicals associated with MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, Jiang and his colleagues found that the &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;treatment reduced the activity of a key enzyme for making certain types of fats. As the activity of this enzyme — called ceramide synthase (CerS) — fell, so did the levels of those fats. The researchers confirmed these effects through additional experiments on mice that had been genetically altered to either decrease or increase their CerS production, as well as on mice fed ceramide supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work "holds significant implications for developing clinical therapeutic strategies targeting gut fungi," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis agreed, adding that the "unexpected discovery" raises the idea that scientists could isolate gut microbes that "we never knew existed to fight human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers plan to study the effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;in humans. They also want to investigate the molecular pathways involved in the therapeutic effect and the roles other intestinal fungi might play in metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study, presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt;, found that even for those taking newer, higher-dose weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, people put weight back on once they stopped treatment. While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs – 16kg on average – patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers studied 6,370 adults in eight randomised controlled trials and three observational studies. Of these, 1,465 patients were taking semaglutide and tirzepatide – higher-dose jabs recommended specifically for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36239137/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; of trials into the efficacy of different diets, not including drugs, by the same researchers, found that while people also regained weight after stopping diets, the rate of regain was much slower, taking at least five years to get back to the weight they were before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,” said Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings raise issues for the NHS, as &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta875/resources/semaglutide-for-managing-overweight-and-obesity-pdf-82613674831813" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nice guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state people should not be on weight loss injections for more than two years. Additionally, many patients give up the treatment, whether because they are buying it privately so cannot afford it, because the side-effects do not suit them or because they are not losing weight any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Is it going to be worth the NHS investing in these drugs if they only have them for a short time and then they pile all the weight back on, or does the NHS have to accept that these are going to be long-term therapies?” Jebb added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Either people really have to accept this as a treatment for life,, or we in science need to think really, really hard, how to support people when they stop the drug​.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the study did not show causality, Jebb speculated that the difference in how fast people put weight back on could be due to the fact that diets are hard and people have to practise restraint to lose weight, whereas if you are taking a drug that knocks your hunger out completely, you don’t have to​ make that effort. “So when the drugs are then taken away, you haven’t got those sort of behavioural strategies in place that help keep the weight off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: “It shouldn’t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle … Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at Surrey University, said there was no point “just throwing people back out into the world of their own lives, carrying on their own behaviours from before” after coming off the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re going to need psychological counselling, behaviour change, nutritional support from that moment on to help them sustain healthier behaviour in the long term, to keep the weight off,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The NHS should introduce a stepped care approach through online support available to large numbers of people at low cost, online or in-person group support or more intensive 1:1 support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jason Halford, at the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said: “We need to ensure patients have the support to make the changes in their behaviour they need to sustain the benefits of treatment. [Weight loss jabs] are an adjunct to behavioural change, not a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxQSWhaczNKTG80T05tWDIxbG54YzZ6dWFnMFZidHVTX0JMbU95SktkY0R6OVI0QTd6dk1UN09mQjFkTjYtbmVzZy1LZlBLSFYtQ3F1aEF5UFBNdlNleVlPcjB1ZUh3UWpwdlpoVjQ5VW44eFkwUkFCa3ZNYjhlazBuX0pGUEUzNmZaNGRNdGZVMlYzdXNadGtWZFBBRkdueHhpYWhQdHUyMXVZdl9XT2lVcEJkRlRsdDZDS1JpS1I1VGxkYjZoTUJaZWR3ZExwRms</guid></item><item><title>健康专家揭示了饭后应该做的一件事--《独立报》 | Health expert reveals the one thing you should do after meals - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamR3NWlxY2luZ0pHUi1sMVNsS3VSS21ZM3pWcFZCa0xvem5MT1pVU1otbDl4Nk5kbmEyMG51RWp3LUU4cmpraHRzcUxUNHdXWXNoSk03QUQ5Zm00czE4WE10c21tZW1yWWJ5S19CbjJQbjRjYjhZblZYN2xUc29XUEtIenN6eURJdVEzbEItU2VUY29BUEVyTHkxVzAtT0Zt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-1d79dbf-0 bMBiKL"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-erjdy9-0 kGIjiJ"&gt;Thank you for registering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1ty8yds-2 cZXkPo"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-0 ekobrD"&gt;Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-1 ebpzYi"&gt;Please refresh your browser to be logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamR3NWlxY2luZ0pHUi1sMVNsS3VSS21ZM3pWcFZCa0xvem5MT1pVU1otbDl4Nk5kbmEyMG51RWp3LUU4cmpraHRzcUxUNHdXWXNoSk03QUQ5Zm00czE4WE10c21tZW1yWWJ5S19CbjJQbjRjYjhZblZYN2xUc29XUEtIenN6eURJdVEzbEItU2VUY29BUEVyTHkxVzAtT0Zt</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家发现音乐重塑记忆的隐藏力量- PsyPost | Neuroscientists discover music’s hidden power to reshape memory - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWGtBNERxbzk2bUlwR2lwR0NNOUVvWEVzc0UyX3NjWmhFS2JfSG9YOGtrSDZHY3c4eVhyM0NOeDU3VEMwN0xnWHo4SkRZR0lmTzlrdWZyRm5Ba2xDdTFoTE1QekhZOWhtMnpoU1hXWnp6UW5qdGFUT09YUFo2b1VBZ1JRMEJWVnJZeVlKZDZBcjA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroimaging study examining episodic memory found that individuals exposed to music during memory recollection were more likely to incorporate emotions associated with the music into their memories. One day later, these memories exhibited a stronger emotional tone than the original recollections. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is a powerful tool for emotional expression, allowing individuals to convey feelings that may be difficult to articulate through words. It is used therapeutically in hospitals and mental health clinics to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. In educational settings, music can aid memory retention and learning, especially when used to teach language, mathematics, or historical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socially, music fosters a sense of community, bringing people together through shared cultural experiences such as concerts, religious ceremonies, and national anthems. Athletes and exercisers often use music to enhance performance and maintain motivation, as certain tempos can regulate heart rate and energy levels. In marketing, music is strategically employed to evoke specific emotions, influencing consumer behavior and brand perception. Music is also integral to rituals and traditions, marking significant life events such as weddings, funerals, and holidays, thereby reinforcing cultural identity and continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yiren Ren and her colleagues sought to explore whether music played during memory recall could introduce false emotional elements into previously neutral memories. In other words, they wanted to examine whether listening to music while recalling memories could alter the emotional tone of those memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 44 healthy young adults recruited from the Georgia Tech School of Psychology subject pool. The average age was approximately 20 years, and the sample included 20 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed an experimental task in which they memorized and recalled several short fictional stories written to resemble autobiographical episodic memories. Episodic memories refer to personal recollections of specific events, including contextual details like time, place, and emotion. The stories were written to be as emotionally neutral as possible so that any emotional changes during recall could be attributed to the experimental manipulation. In total, 15 neutral stories were used in the main task. An additional five stories were written to be emotionally positive or negative and were included to disguise the study’s primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment was conducted over three consecutive days. On Day 1, participants read and listened to recordings of the 20 stories (15 neutral, 5 emotional). Each story was presented twice. Participants then typed out the stories as they imagined them, using as much detail as possible. They also completed standardized assessments of mental imagery ability (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Day 2, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while completing a word selection task designed to prompt recall of the previously studied stories. Each trial displayed 10 words on the screen. Four were key words taken directly from one of the original stories, and six were emotionally valenced lure words—three positive and three negative—that were semantically related to the story but did not appear in the original version. Participants were asked to recall the story associated with the keywords and to select the words that best fit their recollection. Each story was randomly assigned to one of three within-subject conditions: background music with positive emotional valence, background music with negative emotional valence, or silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Day 3, participants completed two memory tests focused on the neutral stories. In one test, participants were presented with words and asked whether each one had appeared in the original story. The word list included both the original keywords and the emotional lures from Day 2. The goal was to assess whether music-induced emotional context during Day 2 recollection would bias participants to falsely remember emotional lures as part of the original story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants exposed to music during Day 2 recollection were more likely to incorporate emotionally congruent lures into their memories. On Day 3, when recalling the stories, they were more likely to report emotional content that matched the valence of the music they had heard during Day 2. In other words, positive music increased the likelihood of recalling stories with added positive elements, and negative music increased the likelihood of negative elaborations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these behavioral findings, the fMRI results revealed that recalling stories with music led to altered patterns of brain activity compared to recalling stories in silence. Specifically, music was associated with increased activity and functional connectivity in regions including the amygdala, frontal cortex, and visual areas. These brain regions are known to be involved in emotion processing, memory, and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggest that these effects manifest through reconsolidation mechanisms and neurally may be intimately linked to amygdala and medial temporal lobe function, as well as diffuse differences in engagement of networks associated with imagery, perspective taking, attention, and control,” the study authors concluded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of music on memories. However, study authors report that participants were generally highly accurate in their recognitions of words. This may have produced a ceiling effect, limiting the magnitude of the observed effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0"&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Yiren Ren, Sophia Kaltsouni Mehdizadeh, Grace Leslie, and Thackery Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 18:15:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWGtBNERxbzk2bUlwR2lwR0NNOUVvWEVzc0UyX3NjWmhFS2JfSG9YOGtrSDZHY3c4eVhyM0NOeDU3VEMwN0xnWHo4SkRZR0lmTzlrdWZyRm5Ba2xDdTFoTE1QekhZOWhtMnpoU1hXWnp6UW5qdGFUT09YUFo2b1VBZ1JRMEJWVnJZeVlKZDZBcjA</guid></item><item><title>宠物猫的禽流感正在上升。业主需要了解的信息-全球新闻 | Bird flu in pet cats is on the rise.

					&lt;p&gt;As a deadly &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak sweeps through wild and domestic bird populations globally, researchers have identified an alarming trend that could bring the virus closer to humans: a significant increase in infections among pet &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt; and other feline species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While avian influenza — commonly known as bird flu — has long been a concern for poultry and wild bird populations, infections in mammals, especially pets like cats, have historically been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that appears to be changing fast, new research warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review, published May 7 in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261/8123920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, found a surge in bird flu virus infections among cats worldwide — both indoor and outdoor — particularly linked to the emergent &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10614208/bird-flu-strains-world-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H5N1 strain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend, experts warn, could signal an increased risk of the virus jumping from animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The review, conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland, analyzed 20 years of scientific data on bird flu in felines, from 2004 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It documented more than 600 cases across 18 countries, with more than 300 fatalities. Researchers found a sharp rise in domestic cat infections over the last few years, specifically in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more cats that get infected with H5N1, the more it creates a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of the virus to and from humans, the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed,” the researchers stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-video-id="10934726" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/10934726/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Canada has not officially reported any bird flu infections in cats, that doesn’t mean they haven’t occurred, said Shayan Sharif, a professor and associate dean with the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been at least one confirmed fatal case of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9602040/avian-flu-dog-death-canada-oshawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avian influenza in a dog in Oshawa, Ont.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has also documented bird flu infections in other domestic animals and wild mammals, fuelling concerns about the virus’s ability to spread across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“H5N1 is already known to infect cats, domestic cats, and also other feline species like tigers, mountain cats … either kept in captivity or the wild,” Sharif said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t actually know was how susceptible cats can be to H5N1, specifically this particular new clade (2.3.4.4b). It’s become quite apparent that domestic cats are, in fact, susceptible to H5N1.”&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;	
	&lt;p&gt;Given how closely cats live with humans, the researchers wanted to find out how widespread bird flu infections might be in feline populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review showed that nearly two-thirds of all known feline infections were in domestic cats, and of those, 71 per cent didn’t survive. The main culprit is the newer H5N1 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b), which first showed up in cats in 2022 and has spread rapidly since.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;It also pinpointed several ways cats are getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most caught the virus by eating infected birds or raw meat. But some cats get sick after drinking raw milk from infected dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the reported infections in felines in the review were confirmed or suspected to be a result of eating dead pigeons, chickens and other birds, as well as contaminated raw chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just outdoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b recently reported by the Colorado Health Department included two indoor-only domestic cats with no known exposure to infected animals,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This observation raises concerns regarding new and unknown transmission routes of (avian influenza) to domestic cats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="section-heading"&gt;	&lt;p class="l-article__sectionHeading c-sectionHeading "&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although very rare, cat-to-human transmission of the virus has been reported, the review stated.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2016, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/spotlights/avian-influenza-cats.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an outbreak of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; happened among cats in New York City animal shelters and more than 100 cats were infected. A veterinarian who had close, prolonged, unprotected exposure to the respiratory secretions of infected cats contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharif said the risk of transmission from cats to humans remains very low, but added it’s still important to stay vigilant during this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In case of avian influence, unfortunately, it can be quite lethal in cats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are neurologic signs, such as tremors and seizures. There have also been indications that they can go blind, unfortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your cat is showing symptoms, he recommends contacting your local vet immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the researchers of the review are calling on wider surveillance among domestic canines to determine how widespread the virus is, “in order to appropriately assess the risk of spillover to humans and other animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-video-id="11072328" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/11072328/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to early data from &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06344026"&gt;the Phase 1/2a ASPIRO (NCT06344026) study&lt;/a&gt;, an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and tolerability of ANPD001 over one year when injected at either of two doses in adults with moderate to advanced Parkinson’s. Researchers are also tracking changes in on time, or periods when motor symptoms are adequately controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this first-of-its-kind study, we are seeing clinician-reported and patient-reported improvements as well as a strong safety and tolerability profile at six months,” Edward Wirth III, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at developer &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/"&gt;Aspen Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aspen-neuroscience-announces-6-month-aspiro-phase-12a-clinical-trial-results-of-personalized-cell-therapy-for-parkinsons-disease-302448009.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were presented in a poster at the 30th World Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders, held May 7–10 in New York. An abstract for the poster, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prd-journal.com/article/S1353-8020(25)00371-2/fulltext"&gt;Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intracranial delivery of autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic precursors in moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Parkinsonism &amp;amp; Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; result from the loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in motor control, and low levels of dopamine lead to slowed or stiff movements, tremors, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Replacing lost neurons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/technology/pipeline/"&gt;ANPD001&lt;/a&gt; is designed to replace the dopaminergic neurons that are gradually lost in Parkinson’s. As an autologous therapy, it uses a patient’s own cells, eliminating the need for immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection by the immune system. The process begins by collecting skin cells from the patient, which are then reprogrammed in the lab into induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stem cells are guided to develop into precursors of dopaminergic neurons and returned to the patient by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/precision-mri-system-part-parkinsons-stem-cell-therapy-trial/"&gt;MRI-guided injection&lt;/a&gt; into a brain region called the putamen, where they’re expected to develop into functional dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRO study involves patients ages 50–70 who respond to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/#Levodopa"&gt;levodopa&lt;/a&gt;, a mainstay Parkinson’s treatment that provides the body with a molecule it can use to produce dopamine, but still have uncontrolled motor symptoms. Its main goal is to test ANPD001’s safety over one year, with patients continuing to be monitored for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the study’s &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/1st-patient-treated-trial-parkinsons-cell-therapy-anpd001/"&gt;launch last year&lt;/a&gt;, ANPD001 has been found safe and well tolerated, with no serious side effects. All patients in the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/cell-therapy-anpd001-safe-first-2-parkinsons-patients-groups-trial/"&gt;first two groups&lt;/a&gt; who received the investigational cell therapy were sent home within 48 hours as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently presented data showed that the three patients who received a low dose of ANPD001 — 5 million precursors of dopaminergic neurons each, delivered in a surgical procedure under general anesthesia — experienced no bleeding or graft-induced dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements caused by the cell therapy). The most common side effects were pain at the surgical site and tongue swelling from lying face down during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At six months, patients experienced a 45% improvement in MDS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III scores, a measure of motor symptom severity, when they were off medication. They also reported a 71% improvement in MDS UPDRS Part II scores, which measures their ability to perform everyday activities such as eating, dressing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, patients had two fewer hours each day of off time, periods when motor symptoms aren’t adequately controlled despite treatment with levodopa, and 1.5 more hours each day of good on time, when motor symptoms are adequately controlled without troublesome side effects, such as involuntary movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANPD001 has received &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-anpd001-autologous-investigational-cell-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;fast track designation&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which may help accelerate its development and regulatory review. Benefits of this status include frequent guidance, expedited approval processes, and eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a common cause of hospital infections, causing &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25164-pseudomonas-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterium is also pretty tough. Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics (known as multidrug-resistant, or MDR &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), hence it is often dubbed a "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-is-a-superbug-77773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;superbug&lt;/a&gt;". In the US, this strain is known to cause thousands of deaths in hospitalized patients each year, as well as tens of thousands of non-lethal infections. Those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to such infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a troublesome organism, but now researchers have found that it is capable of breaking down plastics commonly used in hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the United Kingdom, this research identified an enzyme, named Pap1, that was produced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; taken from a wound. This enzyme can break down biodegradable plastic called polycaprolactone (PCL), which is used in various medical packages and devices, such as sutures, catheters, ventilators, implants, and plastic packaging for medical tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, multiple bacteria have been found to produce enzymes that degrade plastic, but they have all been isolated from the environment. This is the first time one has been identified in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an important development, as it could explain why these bacteria are so persistent in hospitals. If they’re able to degrade plastic, then they may be able to contaminate surfaces and tools that are otherwise thought to be sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to identify this enzyme, the researchers took the gene that codes for the enzyme and transplanted it into &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;scherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. When &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; expressed this enzyme, the team found that it started to break down the PCL on agar plates or beads. The same was true for the &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;isolated from the wound. Finally, the team produced a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;bacterium that had the gene encoding Pap1 removed from it; they found that this version was not capable of degrading plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This poses several clinical challenges with respect to infection. PCL is widely used in medical care and is one of the materials at the forefront of biotechnological innovation due to its favorable biocompatibility profile," the team explains in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a host perspective, the capacity for a pathogen to be able to compromise the structural integrity of any medical device or implant that contains PCL is likely to cause the failure of the medical intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this ability to degrade plastic helps the bacteria survive. If they can create small pits or impressions in the plastic, they have a chance to use them as niches that shield the bacteria from the immune system, disinfectants, or antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the enzyme increases the amount of biofilm the bacteria can produce when compared to a different surface, such as glass. Generally speaking, if bacteria produce higher amounts of biofilm, they are more likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antibiotic-resistance-how-were-trying-to-win-the-microscopic-arms-race-76106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;resistant to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Biofilms are the dominant mode of growth for bacteria, and adopting this mode of growth can make pathogens particularly recalcitrant to treatment," the team explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to test whether the ability of these bacteria to form biofilms would make them more virulent, the team also implanted them into greater wax moth (&lt;em&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/em&gt;) larvae. They found that changing the presence of the enzyme-producing gene in the &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; implant impacted the larvae’s survivability; bacteria that lacked the PCL implant were less harmful than those that had it present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the results demonstrate the risks &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;poses in medical settings, as it can increase &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tiny-robots-entirely-clear-pneumonia-infection-in-mice-in-just-3-days-65528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; rates and also degrade medical plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As it can be degraded by the causative agent of an infection, the potential for increased infection risk and even accelerated degradation of implants or sutures should be considered in device design and treatment planning," they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antimicrobial components could be added to PCL medical devices to reduce the risk of infection and biodegradation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now developing tests to check whether other pathogens can produce plastic-degrading enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8" target="_blank"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 17:31:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPNnFzNHNLSWVQeGxUR3NUUEZQMXQ0NFhySXoxakhZV0h3WEwxUFVQM0NTa2lKV1piYm5zb1E5czRramV5S3NJeUVFUmJCU3EwWUlMMUp1UnlldUpYSDhJNzZaSzk1VFJ4RVNpQm55ZjcwTnczT3k1VEh0RVFneWVzSDNnaDUyZEI3aEM4Ukw1YjBBd3ZWMS0yRzYzNGNWaXMtQktMbkFlaG9VckxGM2pRR1ZwQQ</guid></item><item><title>西雅图16个热门景点，包括餐厅和酒庄，在麻疹感染游客后惊慌失措--《每日邮报》 | Panic after tourist with measles visited 16 popular Seattle hotspots including restaurants and winery - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNWnZsRldvMk1jVHlJSVFoRk5BQ0NhSDhXODdzbms2a3FuR2NJbkQ1aWVNVi03V2RxMUJYZVBZekY5MS1nY3FGTlMzb0V6NC1MVVN4c0Q5MG05TmR3ZjBLbGlwdWJkc3A2TElXZ2xhdXBrTnhjTElqVWp5aUtaM1RiVWUtMW43TkNxZFV2NnFfQTVPdXdYMFY1Qy1PclphaEFMRVR6ZUdkTkF6Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxPQ1JmaTNMWnNaRG5LQm9ISFNkWGxaQlhVLXJGWHcxTm5BY044X2lsZWQyb1ptcnRFM3l4YThYQ3NFQTJweFo4YlM1dHBodU0tM1l1N3BzSXFaNWNvY2hNVExyTU9DVm1RWS1NNUplWk9ScGVqM3pmVlMwakZXRkNyZVd3dUQxYUt1NkVUbC01a0pqR2pOQmFmTmNBTGdnOWNHUDQxclNxQmFOcUZqbkJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Canadian measles patient visited 16 public spots across Seattle while contagious — including gyms, a sushi bar, the airport and a brewery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-state/index.html" id="mol-7c4c9160-30d7-11f0-ae5c-330c6b1a1b5c"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt; are scrambling to alert the public after the tourist unknowingly spread measles across the city at more than a dozen popular destinations before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unidentified traveler spent time in western Washington in King and Snohomish counties between April 30 and May 3 while infectious, according public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health agency confirmed the individual visited 'multiple public locations across the neighborhoods of Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett and Woodinville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They included Residence Inn Northeast/Bothell, LA Fitness in Bellevue, Bellevue Market Place at Factoria Shopping Center, Chateau Ste.

It is the worst outbreak in 30 years and has already killed three people. Other smaller outbreaks bring the total number of cases recorded in 2025 so far to over 1,000. But above all, public-health experts worry that the situation now is a sign of worse to come.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tace001o3b76yshdr4kj@published"&gt;My boyfriend “Kevin” and I have been together for a year and a half, and he’s everything I could want in a life partner. His sister spilled the beans to me that he’s been looking at engagement rings, so I expect him to propose soon. However, there’s one thing that gives me reservations.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tadr001p3b76h0d9438c@published"&gt;When Kevin was in college, he … got around quite a bit. He had more than 300 encounters. The fact that he was with all these other women before he and I met doesn’t bother me. It’s the (what I think could be very real) possibility that we will get married only to have some woman show up demanding child support, or down the line, having to deal with a previously unknown son or daughter tracking him down. Given Kevin’s history, are my concerns valid, and should they give me pause when it comes to accepting a proposal from him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2taiy001s3b76ytsbl06p@published"&gt;Hypothetically, surprise children are always a risk with any man who hasn’t been celibate until marriage. The fact that Kevin engaged in hundreds of sexual encounters during college absolutely does heighten your awareness of that possibility. One really useful, yet missing, crucial piece of information would be whether he consistently used condoms (and other forms of birth control) during these encounters. Sure, they aren’t 100 percent effective, but they do drastically reduce pregnancy. It’s also worth taking into account whether he checked in with partners after any encounter where the condom may have broken or slipped. Basically, if he was having sex with half of his female classmates with no birth control in place, that’s one thing. But if he was taking precautions, it’s less likely that he has a child somewhere that he doesn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2takg001t3b76izepe4ry@published"&gt;That said, a decision to marry someone should take into account your feelings—all of them, including your worries. This concern &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; already giving you pause, and it’s worth doing some introspection around where that’s coming from. What’s behind your aversion to this possibility? Is whatever you find off-putting or worrisome about it also showing up in more subtle ways in your relationship? For instance, do you get the sense that Kevin was irresponsible during his college years, which is maybe reduced but still apparent now? Or do you have pretty rigid ideas about what structures families should have, and, if so, are you prepared for other unforeseen outcomes such as divorce, or untimely death? Are you strongly against having children in your life at all? And, in the event someone comes looking for Kevin later, would you be open to him having a relationship with them while you stay out of it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tam1001u3b76209obse8@published"&gt;I think it’s also really important to consider whether you can share this concern with him and discuss how you might navigate such a situation. If your immediate reaction is, “No, I can’t open up to him about this,” &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; the reason to reject the proposal. But if, when presented with an appropriate opening, the two of you can talk through your worries, you might find yourself more comfortable with proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2m3eg005ff0kxdn8o2q90@published"&gt;I am a recently divorced woman with two daughters. I have been working hard to have a fit body, so I was eager to try out my cute new bikini when I took my daughters to the pool. The problem (at least for some people) is that I am blessed with what is apparently called a “happy trail”: a thin line of dark hair going from my belly button to my bikini line. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/08/happy-trail-grooming-advice.html"&gt;In the past, I have shaved it, but this time I figured I should hold onto this minor vestige of bodily autonomy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:19:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养学家的说法，睡前不应该吃的食物- glamour.com | Foods You Should Never Eat Before Bed, According to a Nutritionist - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBpejhWc0VUd3lBMlE1eUpTeDRUMjZVeWlDZHN2azk0U3F6NkFRakZyOUlzVV9IYVRVNGd0LXRhaERBbGJfZU12T0NZZnFLUVF4X2Z2NzJCTG1KWGFjU0JTNmZGUEYzMXFSU1BkRWF0allNUko3aHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as satisfying as an indulgent &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/the-healthiest-late-night-snac" target="_blank"&gt;midnight snack,&lt;/a&gt; is there? A little somethin’ somethin’ right before (and maybe even in) bed. Maybe you enjoy snacking on a few pieces of chocolate before you hit the hay. Or perhaps you creep to the fridge at 11 p.m., pull out that leftover takeout, and tuck in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, we have some disappointing news—apparently, eating right before bed can cause havoc on the digestive system as you nod off. “Of course there are career or relationship considerations that could get in the way here, but ideally you should aim to have two to four hours between finishing eating and going to bed,” says Kyle Crowley, nutritionist and chief product officer at supplement retailer &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.theproteinworks.com/"}' href="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Protein Works&lt;/a&gt;. “This will give you the best chance at reducing physical discomfort from digesting the food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse? There are certain foods you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; eat before bed if you can help it. Read on for what the experts say about which foods are messing with your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spicy food before bed can sometimes lead to heartburn, which isn’t exactly a recipe for a restful night,” Crowley says. “Plus, chili peppers can raise your body temperature, something that might make it harder for your body to ease into deep sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016787609290048G" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consuming &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/spicy-foods-chilli-peppers-live-longer" target="_blank"&gt;spicy food&lt;/a&gt; can disrupt sleep and lead to more time awake throughout the night. In fact, people who eat spicy food every day have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131218/" target="_blank"&gt;4.73 times greater odds of insomnia&lt;/a&gt; than those who never eat spicy food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramen is another spicy dish that it might be best avoid before bed—no matter how tempting that takeout box in the fridge may be. Not only is ramen often spicy, it’s also made with processed noodles that can be &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles"}' href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to digest&lt;/a&gt;, often taking &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/"}' href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;longer than two hours&lt;/a&gt; to work its way through your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oranges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acidic foods like citrus fruits can increase your chances of heartburn,” says Crowley. “It might help to enjoy these earlier in the day rather than as a late-night treat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fried chicken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there—it’s 2 a.m., you’ve had a little too much to drink, and the allure of some chicken nuggets call out to you. However, as delicious as it can be (especially late at night) fried foods probably aren’t the best food for your late-night meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research shows that fatty foods can reduce sleep quality and lead to more restless nights,” Crowley says. “So avoid heavy, greasy meals like fried chicken close to bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you’ve got in the fridge is a tantalizing block of cheddar. However, it might lead to a weird night’s sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229376/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that dairy products can lead to lighter sleep. In fact, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2"}' href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many people find&lt;/a&gt; that consuming cheese right before bed can lead to vivid dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this probably comes as bad news to late-night snackers. But while it is better to avoid food altogether at night, there are some foods you should never eat before bed—and there are some foods that will probably sit a little better. Try reaching for a handful of nuts (which contain melatonin), a glass of milk (which may support better sleep), or some &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/the-sleepy-girl-mocktail" target="_blank"&gt;cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; (which helps regulate sleep hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was previously published in &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/foods-never-eat-before-bed" target="_blank"&gt;Glamour UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:53:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBpejhWc0VUd3lBMlE1eUpTeDRUMjZVeWlDZHN2azk0U3F6NkFRakZyOUlzVV9IYVRVNGd0LXRhaERBbGJfZU12T0NZZnFLUVF4X2Z2NzJCTG1KWGFjU0JTNmZGUEYzMXFSU1BkRWF0allNUko3aHc</guid></item><item><title>专家刚刚发现，阿尔茨海默氏症的症状可以在20多岁和30多岁时出现。以下是需要注意的事项-雅虎 | Experts Just Discovered That Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Surface In Your 20s And 30s.

Ultimately, 1,112 study participants who did in-home interviews were given cognitive tasks like immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span. They also provided a sample for genetic testing.

However, as a humble nutrient, fiber is often overlooked. But what if this is the missing ingredient to weight loss success? Can fiber supplements replace whole foods? In this podcast, a nutritionist answers readers’ questions about fiber and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the internet is awash with articles, charts, and recipes centered around eating more protein — anything from a 30-gram-protein breakfast to high-protein drinks and more — to naturally lose weight. And although the key to achieving good weight loss results is indeed a higher protein intake, there is a nutrient that is often overlooked: fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, statistics show that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007499?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans realistically meet their recommended daily fiber intake, which is on average up to &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;34 grams (g)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for adult men and about 28 g for adult women. So, how can we eat more fiber?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/in-conversation-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;In Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll be tackling burning questions such as: What is fiber, and why is it important for our bodies? How can we tell whether we are eating enough fiber? Is it right to call fiber nature’s Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll differentiate between soluble and insoluble fiber while discussing the ideal daily intake for different people. We’ll also touch on how fiber supplements like psyllium husk compare with whole foods, weighing their benefits for our well-being. We will also look at how fiber plays a crucial role in fighting insulin resistance and its potential role in supporting weight management goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discuss this and more, we’re joined by registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/authors/lisa-valente" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lisa Valente&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD.

And when you buy them frozen, they’re just more affordable and easier to have on hand. [T]hey don’t go bad on you in a day — so, you can add those to smoothies or mix them into oatmeal or yogurt,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa said her second choice would be whole wheat pasta and shared a fun fact about fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brown rice only has one gram more of fiber than white rice, but whole wheat pasta has significantly more than white pasta. [It creates] like this nice fiber-rich carbohydrate base to your dinner to add some vegetables or protein to,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her third choice was chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sprinkle them on oatmeal, but you can also make chia seed pudding where you soak them with some milk or non-dairy milk and add a little bit of fruit. They’re very filling and they not only have fiber, but they also have omega-3 and a little bit of protein. So I feel like they’re sort of this tiny but mighty little seed where you can check off a lot of nutrition boxes at once. So if I had to pick three, that’s a good starting place for me,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please listen to our podcast episode in full below or on your preferred streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our podcast has also been shortlisted in two categories — Best Health, Wellbeing &amp;amp; Food Podcast and the Best Science &amp;amp; Medical Podcast — at this year’s &lt;a href="https://publisherpodcasts.com/2025/en/page/shortlist2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Publisher Podcast Summit and Awards&lt;/a&gt;.

But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELdIBtgFBVV95cUxNT3ZwUlhKTHhXMGJqVDVwSmZGbC1YZXNVSHRqaW56SVFNbEF5dTJYeEp4bTFjSDE4LUk5eTFqSEsxellJY2tqalNndTl3Y1lNSE5tbkVUOU5aMHljMld6NUYxQ1JqLUhFTVUwcHZONElDb282dWtweFdWLXo5bzVyUXlsRS1xNDI5RnZ3ZUVUQXdWNHVKRnlxUmhaTFJTd1VYOHhlSVR3ZEROa2FXQzVoR0xoX1E4dw</guid></item><item><title>人类“超级免疫力” –被蛇咬超过100次的男人有助于创造革命性的抗蛇毒血清- SciTechDaily | Human “Super Immunity” – Man Bitten by Snakes Over 100 Times Helps Create Revolutionary Antivenom - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR</guid></item><item><title>高效RRMS疗法可能有助于保持工作能力-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | High-efficacy RRMS therapies may help maintain capacity to work - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxQeXRwQ09JcnBvZHpMMkxCaUR2cGZ6Qk83ZGQxQlV5Sjd1aGlHZzNvNG02VWRmV3NBbHdUS3d5TXQzRFlGamV2aU9hWGFkWG1RaFBvaVAya21ySzE4ZlV1OTI5c1M3QlYwRThScGVxeENEekJ4cmk4eVBmZVR5ZDFtdXlucV9IZ3FzdXYzV1VFbkNTaWRtVVBLQUhHWWp0UjAySm5kTkMxLS00NFZreE8ydWdoaTFGOWFjNXF6NjNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of high-efficacy &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; (DMTs) among &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) patients may aid their capacity to work on the economy — and put them at a lower risk of needing protected employment programs — than those on moderate-efficacy DMTs, according to a new study from Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that people with RRMS who are started on high-efficacy DMTs may be less likely to enter such protected programs than patients initially prescribed moderate-efficacy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the use of more effective &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) treatments may have a socioeconomic impact on patients and their capacity to do work, per the researchers. However, the team highlighted that the category of DMT did not significantly affect the proportion of people who received disability pensions from the Danish government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Initiating [high-efficacy treatment] as the first DMT was associated with a lower risk of becoming employed in a protected employment scheme. … [But] we found no difference in disability pension risk between the two treatment groups,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, among MS patients, “treatment strategy can influence labor marked affiliation,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034825002081"&gt;Socioeconomic Impact of Initial High vs. Moderate Efficacy Disease-Modifying Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis: Effects on Labor Market Affiliation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;. The work was funded by the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Society, a patient organization in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Investigating DMT type on patients’ capacity to do work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS, a progressive disease, is known to affect the brain and spinal cord, and often leads to problems with movement and thinking. A common form of the disease, RRMS is marked by episodes of new or worsening &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; followed by periods of recovery. Several approved treatments for RRMS are DMTs, which work by suppressing or altering immune system activity to slow or prevent disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMTs can be highly effective or moderately effective: High-efficacy DMTs tend to reduce disease activity more than their counterparts but also carry a greater risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been widespread study of the effects of high- and moderate-efficacy DMTs on RRMS symptoms. However, the researchers noted, “evidence of DMTs’ impact on socioeconomic outcomes, such as working capacity, is limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, most people with MS begin on a moderate-efficacy DMT, then move to a high-efficacy therapy if they don’t respond. In recent years, though, more patients — particularly those with high disease activity — have been prescribed high-efficacy therapies as their first DMTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter approach is now most frequently used for new cases of RRMS in Denmark, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the type of DMT can impact employment, the researchers looked at two programs in Denmark intended to help people with long-term disabilities, such as those caused by RRMS. Disability pensions are stipends that can provide income without employment when a person’s ability to work is severely reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another program, called &lt;a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/flexi-job-scheme"&gt;flexi-jobs&lt;/a&gt;, offers more flexible employment opportunities for people whose capacity to work has been reduced by at least 50% and are therefore unable to get a job under other circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Flexi-jobs … often serve as an intermediate step for individuals whose condition may later necessitate a transition to disability pension,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;No differences found on disability pensions, however&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used a national MS registry to identify people with RRMS on DMTs. They cross-referenced this with a database of disability pensions and flexi-jobs using the personal identification number assigned to each person in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, they matched pairs of individuals on moderate- and high-efficacy DMTs with similar demographic characteristics like age and sex to create comparable treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly different populations were used to analyze the disability pension and flexi-job programs, as people who were participating in the program of interest before they started DMTs were excluded. Both analyses included slightly more than 1,000 participants, evenly split between the categories of DMT. The patients’ average age  at treatment start was 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statistically significant difference between the groups was found when it came to flexi-jobs, according to the researchers. Specifically, after accounting for participants who died, emigrated from Denmark, or reached retirement age, there was a 16.2% probability of enrolling in the flexi-job program within three years in the moderate-efficacy DMT group. In the high-efficacy DMT group, this probability was significantly lower, at 9.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Since labour market affiliation significantly impacts the patient-perceived quality of life, socioeconomic outcomes are meaningful, patient-centered outcomes that regulators and researchers should consider in future studies evaluating the effectiveness of treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disability pensions did not differ significantly between the groups, but were slightly more common in the moderate-efficacy DMT group. With adjustments, 9.1% of those on high-efficacy therapies and 11.8% of those on moderate-efficacy therapies received disability pensions within three years of initiating treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that high-efficacy DMTs may minimize the effects of RRMS on working capacity compared to moderate-efficacy DMTs. However, “it is worth noting that disability pensions and flexi-jobs are complex outcomes subject to political and social legislation,” rather than objective measures of working capacity, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both programs are also specific to Denmark, so the team cautions against generalizing their findings too broadly, though some of their findings may also be applicable elsewhere. But, “we believe that extrapolations, to some extent, are valid in different countries,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, per the scientists, these findings highlight the need for clinicians to consider work ability among patients when prescribing treatments for RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since labour market affiliation significantly impacts the patient-perceived quality of life, socioeconomic outcomes are meaningful, patient-centered outcomes that regulators and researchers should consider in future studies evaluating the effectiveness of treatment strategies,” the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

The workout itself was fine, but it was an offhand comment the instructor made about bone density that got me. Hers, she said, was exceptionally good. She’d recently gotten a bone scan and had been told by her doctor that she had &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; bone density for her age (she is in her early 30s). She attributed her wonderful bones to Pilates and moved on, but I didn’t. We were all told as children to drink our milk for strong bones, but I’d never really thought about my bone health beyond that. Suddenly, I was worried that I’d been neglecting it. When was the last time &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; chugged a tall glass of milk?&lt;/p&gt;

Rebekah Rotstein, who founded the bone-health exercise platform &lt;a href="https://buff-bones.com/"&gt;Buff Bones&lt;/a&gt;, attributes bone density’s newfound popularity, at least in part, to the boom in menopause awareness (which we can also trace to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; boom, this one in &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/menopause-celebrity-business-stacy-london-naomi-watts-judy-greer.html"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/perimenopause-gold-rush-healthcare-companies-treatments.html"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;-related businesses in recent years). “&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/millennials-midlife-crisis-money-job-security.html"&gt;Midlife is having a big moment now&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “There’s a lot more attention to menopause, and one of the silent &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/what-is-perimenopause-symptoms-explained.html"&gt;symptoms of menopause&lt;/a&gt; is bone loss. Osteoporosis is considered a silent disease in the sense that you have no sensation or feeling that you’re losing bone. It’s painless unless you’ve had a fracture.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z0tn001f3b7844c0iuwi@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;From social media, I eventually formed a vague understanding that lifting weights would make my bones … denser? Still, I didn’t totally understand what bone density was or how it was relevant to me. Was it even? (Spoiler: It absolutely was.) I spoke with four experts to answer these questions and all of our FAQs about what bone density is and how to maintain it. I’m happy to report that the answers were simpler and more whimsical than you may think — and, personally, I’ll never think of my bones the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z0x9001h3b78yz43tqg6@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;It’s a pretty straightforward term; bone density is the density of your bones. But what does that look like, exactly? &lt;a href="https://www.nyarthritis.com/index.php/meet-dr-stella-bard/"&gt;Dr. Stella Bard&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical rheumatologist, uses the analogy of a honeycomb to explain bone structure to her patients: It’s a latticelike network. “It has empty spaces where the bone was resorbed,” Bard explains. And that honeycomb is constantly remodeling itself. “Bone is not what you think it is,” she says. “You have living cells inside the bone called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The way I remember it is the osteoclast chews — the C stands for “chewing,” and it chews up old bone. And then comes along an osteoblast that builds it back up.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ab001i3b787o8kfklg@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drvondawright.com/"&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright&lt;/a&gt;, an orthopedic sports surgeon and researcher and the author of &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt;, says that, in addition to being the structure that gives shape to our muscles and organs, bone is itself a metabolic organ system. “Bone is where our blood cells are made,” she says. “We think of it as just dry bones, right? But it is a living dynamic organism that replaces itself every ten years.” If you have good bone density, it means that your bone structure is rebuilding itself at approximately the same rate as it is being resorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1d1001j3b78p4kjnkyn@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;Bone density isn’t the only component of your overall bone health, but it is the easiest to measure. “We talk about bone density as this discrete entity, but we know now that it’s not just about the density itself,” says &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_serota-alana.asp"&gt;Dr. Alana Serota&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine doctor who specializes in metabolic bone disorders, osteoporosis, and women’s health. “It’s not just the quantity, but the quality of the bone, which is a little more nebulous. So bone density is not the only factor, but it’s an important factor in bone health. It’s sort of a blunt instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1e7001k3b787vjo1fqe@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;And it accounts for about 60 to 70 percent of bone strength, says Rotstein. “The hard mineralization within bone is what makes it dense,” she explains. “But if bone is only that side of the scale, it also is problematic, and there’s pathologies when bones become too brittle. On the other side, you do want resilience and flexibility within the bone. That’s where collagen comes in. You want a good balance of these.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ja001l3b78j5yat6ol@published" data-word-count="122"&gt;When our osteoclasts are chewing up our bones more quickly than our osteoblasts can rebuild them, our bone density starts to lower — eventually leading to osteoporosis, a condition of weak and brittle bones. Going back to Bard’s honeycomb analogy, “With less of the lattice and architecture available, it’s more likely to shatter,” she says. “Like an eggshell — it’s very fragile and it’s very easy to crack and break. Osteoporosis really means holes in the bones. The bones already have holes in them; it just means more holes in the bones, bigger holes in the bones.” That means your bones are significantly more likely to break or fracture, and have a much harder time repairing themselves in the case of injury.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1oa001n3b78ygns27zl@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;Well, everyone is. As we age, we start breaking down bone faster than we’re building it. In particular, those of us born with ovaries are at a higher risk, especially once we hit menopause. “We lose up to 20 percent of our bone mass in the first five to seven years after menopause,” says Rotstein. “In menopause, we don’t have estrogen anymore; we’re still building bone through the osteoblast,” explains Wright. “Estrogen helps control the osteoclast, the bone-breakdown cell, and so there’s a mismatch and we’re breaking down more than we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1py001o3b78domxeqp2@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;You don’t go straight to osteoporosis, though. Rotstein says we should also be looking out for its precursor, osteopenia. “More than 80 percent of fragility fractures actually occur in women with osteopenia,” she says. That’s at least partially because significantly more people have osteopenia than osteoporosis, but it’s worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ts001p3b782hkrcaxr@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;“The risk of death after a hip fracture is higher than the risk of death after a heart attack,” says Serota. “It’s just we don’t have a cute ribbon; we’re not good with our PR. It doesn’t seem as dramatic as it is.” And because of factors like menopause and longer lifespans, people with uteruses have a much higher incidence of osteoporosis, about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1yu001q3b78i34ge93j@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;There’s a range of other risk factors to think about, too, says Wright. “We build bone across our lifespan, and our peak bone mass is supposed to occur in our early 30s,” she explains. But many of her patients have had to take medications that break down bone throughout their lives, are smokers or vapers, have lived sedentary lifestyles, or were athletes who didn’t eat enough. A full list of risk factors can be found &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If any of them apply to you, it’s probably a good idea to get a bone scan early. Recommendations vary, but Wright says that you should get your first one by age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z20n001r3b78sved3ymt@published" data-word-count="32"&gt;Bottom line: “Everybody has the potential to lose bone,” says Wright. “Not everybody &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lose bone, because you can get in front of this, which is what I want people to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z23x001t3b78ucyib7nm@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;The longtime gold standard scan is a DEXA scan, which uses X-ray technology to measure bone density. Bard describes it as “the easiest test you’ll ever take.” It involves lying down on a table while a scanning arm scans your bones. “A lot of it depends on the machine that’s doing the scanning, and we tell people to pick a place that’s close to home, that’s convenient for you, because it’s better to use the same machine to scan you every two years,” says Bard. “Your insurance will normally pay for every two years unless you’re osteoporotic, in which case it might pay for annual bone-density screenings.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z25j001u3b78dnv77zhy@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.aaos.org/aaosnow/2024/dec/clinical/clinical02/#:~:text=Radiofrequency%20echographic%20multi%2Dspectrometry%20(REMS)%20is%20an%20ultrasound%20technology,a%20predictor%20of%20fracture%20risk."&gt;REMS scan&lt;/a&gt;, which uses ultrasound technology to evaluate bone density &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bone quality, says Wright. But while there’s a lot of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10217295/'"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; for this type of scan, since it’s still very new, it’s not as widely recommended or widely used as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z28n001v3b78e8ydnkfq@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;Bard, Wright, Serota, and Rotstein all recommend getting scanned early, while you have time to improve your bone density if your results aren’t what you expected. Wright says every patient who comes into her clinic gets referred for a bone scan, and they generally aren’t too difficult to come by — you can even pay to get one at some gyms. If you want your insurance to cover it, though, you will need a referral from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2ff001x3b78ssl1l01y@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;I’ll be honest: I was a little skeptical that Pilates was the key to my bone health, and at the idea that my workout routine (or lack thereof, most of the time) would affect my bones at all. On this, I was once again &lt;em&gt;dead wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2ki001y3b78qjq6ccn4@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;There are three types of exercise most important for bone health. The first is the one you’ve probably heard about: weight-bearing exercise, which can mean anything from strength-based movements that take advantage of your body weight to lifting heavy in the gym. That could include Pilates. “I count Pilates as strength training,” Wright says. “You’re engaging your muscles, you are working on strength.” But while some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251391"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/BMR-150604"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; indicate that Pilates can help improve your bone density, Serota, Wright, Bard, and Rotstein all say that lifting weights is the most effective, proven form of strength training you can do to target bone health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2pl001z3b7817vym7xh@published" data-word-count="113"&gt;More surprising for me was the importance of simply jumping around. Turns out being fun and whimsical has a side effect of increasing your bone density. “We must impact our bones,” says Wright. “Every jumping exercise that could possibly be will help build better bone: Jumping 20 times a day, or doing ten minutes of dedicated jumping, as simple as skipping, jumping rope, hopscotch, literally jumping up and down at your desk and landing hard with impact, can help build bone.” Rotstein says explosive movements that train your ability to rapidly produce force are also important: Kickboxing, medicine-ball throwing, and any performance or athletic training that involves speed would fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2rc00203b788knsgq3h@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;The last expert-recommended form of exercise is not as directly related to building bone density but is essential for protecting your bones over time. That’s right, give it up for balance. The sooner you start thinking about it, the better. “You want to integrate balance into your life, because even the most elite athletes, an injury will undo their balance,” says Serota. “Stand at the sink and brush your teeth and stand on one leg. Make that part of your practice and your life.” If you’re looking to target your balance more intentionally, Rotstein says yoga, tai chi, and Pilates are all great options that will help with neuromuscular control, balance, proprioception, and fall prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2t100213b78mgf8t1ew@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;Ultimately, says Bard, “whatever exercises the muscle also exercises the bone and encourages bone building.” It’s not always realistic to maintain the perfect, multimodal fitness routine, but taking ten minutes to jump up and down or stand on one leg can make a difference. “The goal is,” Serota says, “you’re sweating more days of the week than not.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2uv00223b78h7f2d3vg@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;“All the things that are good for your health anyway will be good for your bones,” Serota adds. That’s true for exercise and for nutrition, too. Most of us have heard our whole lives that calcium is essential for strong bones, but so is vitamin D (and K2 along with it). “Vitamin D is the vitamin that makes sure that calcium is pushed in and builds the bone,” Bard explains. But make sure you’re getting enough calcium for the vitamin D to do its work: “If you don’t provide your body with the brick, it’s not going to have the materials to build up the bone,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2wb00233b7802parrnk@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;The ideal is always to get your nutrition through your diet, says  Serota. “I always prefer that people eat rather than swallow.” To her, supplement mania is deeply troubling. “If you’re worried about Big Pharma, I’d like to introduce you to Big Vita,” she says. “They have a lot less skin in the game and less to prove, and they can kind of give you anything.” If you do need to take a supplement, though, she recommends the brands &lt;a href="https://www.solgar.com/"&gt;Solgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bluebonnetnutrition.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopvg_iy8nI2HThTIMke5gfx_qwujPoUZU7tGwvLh6c4861CmkVn"&gt;Bluebonnet&lt;/a&gt;, and any others that have USP certifications, which basically means they undergo third-party testing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2y100243b78s7qbet8n@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/06/should-i-be-taking-calcium-supplements.html"&gt;calcium supplements&lt;/a&gt;, make sure they’re actually necessary before you take them, since it is possible to get &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/a-gummy-vitamins-healthy.html"&gt;too much&lt;/a&gt; of it. “For younger people, it’s 1,000 mg a day for skeletal needs; for older people, it’s between 1,200 and 1,500,” says Serota. The best source is, as we all know, milk and other dairy products. But many people are lactose intolerant (including myself), and while there are plenty of plant-based foods that contain calcium, like leafy greens and tofu, Serota says those who don’t eat dairy should probably be taking a supplement. She recommends non-dairy milks and other drinks, like orange juice, that are supplemented with calcium or encapsulated calcium citrate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z31x00253b784erjl0rd@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;“It’s better to prevent loss of bone than to treat loss of bone, but you can build bone at any age,” says Wright. So no matter what your bone-scan results are, there are steps you can take. As for me, I’ll be digging out my jump rope from the depths of my closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning. We’ve got a lot going on today. A bunch of my colleagues are in San Francisco for our &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/stat-summit-west/" rel=""&gt;Breakthrough Summit West&lt;/a&gt;, which is focused on the impact of AI on health innovation. Among those taking the stage: Robert Califf and Reed Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also today, health secretary RFK Jr. will be testifying in front of lawmakers about cuts to HHS. More on that below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-know-this-morning"&gt;The need-to-know this morning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSK is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/14/gsk-mash-liver-disease-boston-pharmaceuticals/" rel=""&gt;paying $1.2 billion upfront&lt;/a&gt; to Boston Pharmaceuticals for an experimental drug to treat the liver disease known as MASH. The deal for the “Phase 3 ready” drug, called efimosfermin, includes another $800 million if certain milestones are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rfk-jr-set-to-defend-hhs-cuts-on-capitol-hill-today"&gt;RFK Jr. set to defend HHS cuts on Capitol Hill today&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bill Cassidy, the Republican leader of the Senate’s health committee, plans to question health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today about his overhaul of HHS, according to excerpts of his opening remarks at a hearing scheduled for later today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy plans to encourage reforms at the agency — saying “bureaucratic bloat and regulatory hurdles” are impeding the agency’s core work — but also push for Congress to be included in the plans for reform, according to the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is going before the health committee to discuss the Trump administration’s budget request, which — if approved by Congress — would reduce HHS’ budget by nearly a quarter from its current levels. Kennedy is also scheduled to testify before the House Appropriations Committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/14/cassidy-to-question-robert-f-kennedy-hhs-cuts-overhaul-senate-hearing/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from STAT’s Daniel Payne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-novo-signs-deal-with-septerna-to-develop-obesity-pills"&gt;Novo signs deal with Septerna to develop obesity pills&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk said this morning that it will work with the biotech Septerna to develop oral GLP-1 obesity drugs, as it races to catch up to Eli Lilly’s efforts to bring a more convenient weight loss treatment to the market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Septerna, which specializes in making small molecule drugs, is eligible to receive about $2.2 billion from Novo, including more than $200 million in upfront and near-term milestone payments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The companies said they’ll start with four development programs for potential small molecule treatments directed at targets within a class of receptor called G protein-coupled receptors — including commonly targeted receptors like GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon hormone receptors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/14/novo-nordisk-septerna-wegovy-obesity-weight-loss-pills/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-patient-treated-with-prime-editing"&gt;First patient treated with prime editing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From my colleague Jason Mast&lt;/em&gt;: The first ever patient has been treated with prime editing, a powerful technology for making precise changes to DNA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harry Malech, an NIH researcher and investigator on the study, announced the news yesterday during an award speech at the American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy meeting, apparently against the wishes of Prime Medicine, the company that devised the experimental therapy. “They’ll probably throw bricks at me,” he joked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The therapy is for chronic granulomatous disease, a very rare genetic disorder that impairs the immune system and leaves patients vulnerable to deadly infections. Researchers are attempting to insert two missing DNA letters into patients’ blood cells — a genetic surgery that can only be done with prime editing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prime, which has been struggling financially, received FDA clearance for the trial last August. But the rarity of the disease and the complication of the procedure – blood cells have to be removed, edited, and then returned – has likely made recruitment slow. The company has promised to release data this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-tucks-nbsp-a-nbsp-subtle-threat-in-his-nbsp-drug-pricing-order-nbsp"&gt;Trump tucks a subtle threat in his drug pricing order &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embedded in President Trump’s executive order this week is a sentence that appears to threaten that the Food and Drug Administration could withdraw drug approvals if pharma companies don’t lower their prices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The order specifically gives drugmakers 30 days to agree on lower prices with the government, with the aim of bringing prices down to what other countries pay. Notably, the order says that if “significant progress” is not made on lowering prices, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary would be empowered to “review and potentially modify or revoke approvals granted for drugs… that [may be] unsafe, ineffective, or improperly marketed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and legal experts question the legality of that provision, though, since the FDA can only withdraw approval of a medicine if certain statutory criteria are met, like if the drug is unsafe or if there is a lack of data on effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/05/13/trump-fda-medicines-pharma-biotech-withdrawals-illegal-safety-pricing-executive-order/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from STAT’s Ed Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-the-u-s-get-europe-to-raise-drug-prices"&gt;Can the U.S. get Europe to raise drug prices?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of Trump’s plan relates to his goal of getting other developed regions like Europe to pay more for drugs, in order to narrow the discrepancy between drug prices in the U.S. and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have suggested that they could raise the issue of drug prices as part of ongoing trade negotiations with the European Union, but it won’t be easy to get European countries to budge, my colleague Drew Joseph reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Europe, drug prices are negotiated and determined country by country, making it harder for the U.S. to exert influence on regions it deems to be bad actors. Additionally, European countries have already been spending more on medicines over time as prices rise, leaving them little room to pay even more for medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

Surgical masks help protect patients from potential bacteria and other microorganisms from health-care workers’ noses and mouths.

In contrast, disliked vegetables like beets or sprouts are typically rejected due to distaste, an aversion based on taste or texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that meat rejection involves deeper psychological and evolutionary mechanisms, possibly linked to avoiding pathogens. Researchers believe this emotional response strengthens with intentional meat avoidance, such as during Veganuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust vs. Distaste:&lt;/strong&gt; Meat is rejected with disgust, while vegetables are rejected due to distaste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathogen Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; Disgust toward meat may have evolved to help humans avoid disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior Reinforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; The disgust response can strengthen with deliberate meat avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many vegetarians who reject meat feel disgust which closely matches the aversion others feel to the idea of eating human flesh, feces or dog meat, new research has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by the University of Exeter set out to investigate whether there is a difference in the psychological mechanisms by which people reject meat compared to vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an online study involving 300 people (mostly vegetarians), researchers found that people who reject vegetables they dislike do so because they feel ‘distaste’ – a simple aversion to taste, texture, or smell of a food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when people dislike and reject meat that would be considered appetising by omnivores (such as roast chicken or beef steak), they feel the more complex emotion disgust, in a similar way that meat-eaters were disgusted by the idea of eating human meat, feces, or dog meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Natalia Lawrence, of the University of Exeter said: “This is the most robust evidence to date that we reject meat and vegetables that we find repellent based on different underlying processes. Obviously finding meat disgusting can help people avoid eating it, which has health and environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we’ve conducted suggests that these feelings of disgust may develop when people deliberately reduce or avoid eating meat, such as during Veganuary ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Appetite,&lt;/em&gt; recruited 252 people who reject meat and 57 omnivores who eat meat. Researchers tested responses to images of 11 different substances (palatable meat; vegetables which are commonly disliked, such olives, sprouts, raw aubergine, and beetroot. Participants were asked several questions about how eating each of the foods would make them feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each question was linked to either disgust (e.g. ‘&lt;em&gt;I would dislike any dish which contained even the tiniest amount of this food, even if I could not taste, smell, feel, or see it.’&lt;/em&gt;) or distaste (e.g. ’&lt;em&gt;I would dislike the taste, smell, or texture of this food.’&lt;/em&gt;) which allowed the researchers to make a distinction between what people felt (disgust or distaste) when they rejected different foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare reactions, the meat-eating participants were also shown images of substances which everyone considers disgusting to eat: human flesh, dog meat and faeces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded 557 rejections of meat (up to three rejections from 252 people), and 670 rejections of vegetables (up to 2 rejections each from 309 people). Where participants said they would not eat the item pictured, they completed questions to investigate the grounds for rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently, people rejected vegetables they did not like based on distaste, and rejected meat and disgust elicitors in a strikingly similar disgust pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Elisa Becker, who conducted the work at the University of Exeter and has since moved to Oxford University, said: “Meat eaters responded to the idea of eating these truly disgusting substances like faeces in the same way that vegetarians responded to images of meat that they didn’t want to eat, and this was very different from the way they responded to vegetables they rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we may think we’re rejecting a food simply because we don’t want to eat it, we showed that the basis for this rejection is quite different – and we think that’s evolved to protect us from pathogens that can lie undetected in meat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this food aversion and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f282809781819d94949b9197b2978a97869780dc9391dc8799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2025.108033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalia Lawrence et al. &lt;em&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may reject foods due to distaste (an affective reaction to undesirable sensory properties) or disgust (an emotive response to the idea of what a food represents). Disgust can further be classified into sub-types: core, animal-reminder, and moral disgust, all of which could influence food rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research suggests different rejection mechanisms for plant and animal foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested this in an online study in a meat-rejecting sample (mostly vegetarians, n = 252), and a meat-accepting sample (omnivores, n = 57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants rated foods they rejected for consumption on criteria related to distaste (e.g. objection to taste), general disgust (e.g. contamination potential of the food), and specific disgust sub-types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings across these criteria created unique response profiles for commonly disliked vegetables, meats, universal disgust elicitors, and accepted food (control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual inspection of response profiles, correlations, and a multidimensional scaling analysis all revealed that plant foods were rejected based on distaste, whereas rejection responses to palatable meat closely matched responses to human meat, faeces, and dog meat (disgust elicitors), both rejected based on disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspecting disgust response profiles suggested that core disgust was the primary disgust type, with animal-reminder and moral disgust sometimes experienced in addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study confirms differential rejection mechanisms for plant-based foods (rejected via distaste) and meat (core disgust).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests different evolutionary strategies humans had to adapt to cope with plant toxins detectable through distaste and pathogens found in meat not detectable by taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such adaptations could be leveraged in future interventions to reduce meat consumption or increase vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:42:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DcjZsYzBfb3pfTktCWjBpckNPcmEzaHdBOFdldlhvSGc3dFNoeXMtNC1VSmJqdVh4c1NVSEluTkttM2p2eVJ4Uk82UjBnR0J6UThGSEhSWHgwb3JRV0JuajZJSDkxcHBxdHZqbW5INA</guid></item><item><title>这种疾病会杀死最脆弱的婴儿。我们可以阻止它。- vox.com | This illness kills babies at their most vulnerable.

Countries where poverty was once near-universal, like India or Indonesia, &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=ID-IN"&gt;are now considered middle-income&lt;/a&gt;. Some populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, like Kenya or Nigeria, are, if not completely politically stable, now possessed of enough real state capacity to try &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00369-2/fulltext"&gt;ambitious projects&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/kenya-is-overhauling-its-national-healthcare-scheme-after-58-years-what-would-make-the-transition-less-painful-240963"&gt;universal health coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The resources available to these nations are still highly limited by rich-world standards.

Sepsis is a catch-all term for infections that provoke an overwhelming immune response, damaging internal organs, and in the worst cases, leading to death. Sepsis can in principle be caused by anything — a virus, a fungus, a protozoa — but in practice, most infants who get it get it from a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15371-sepsis-in-newborns"&gt;bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In one way, that’s good: We have antibiotics! In another way, it’s bad: The &lt;a href="/future-perfect/353420/drug-resistant-bacteria-are-killing-more-and-more-humans-we-need-new-weapons"&gt;risk of antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; means you don’t want to overuse them.

The main technique is “&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-a-blood-culture-test"&gt;blood culturing&lt;/a&gt;,” which involves taking blood from the patient, putting it in a liquid “culture” that reacts if bacteria are present, and waiting to see the reaction show up. This is expensive and often takes two to three days, potentially delaying life-saving treatment. It also has very high “false negative” rates, with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article-abstract/61/1/1/1647506?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;studies showing that a large share of neonatal sepsis cases&lt;/a&gt; occur in babies who test negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

The estimates we have on the toll of neonatal sepsis aren’t precise, but the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/334216/9789240010789-eng.pdf#page=25"&gt;best figure I’ve seen, from the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), is a range of 400,000 to 700,000 deaths a year. That’s in the same ballpark as malaria (&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-death-estimates-from-who"&gt;600 to 700,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;) and HIV/AIDS (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics"&gt;630,000 deaths in 2023&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/diseases-injuries-risks/factsheets/2021-neonatal-sepsis-and-other-neonatal"&gt;studies go lower&lt;/a&gt; (more like 200,000) but, because they &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8311109/#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20most%20studies%20that%20we%20included%20in%20our%20review%2C%20cases%20of%20pneumonia%20are%20captured%20in%20the%20GBD%20modelling%20of%20pneumonia%20as%20a%20separate%20entity%2C%20but%20not%20as%20neonatal%20sepsis%20cases"&gt;exclude infant deaths&lt;/a&gt; from pneumonia-caused sepsis, underestimate the number of deaths that could be saved by better targeting antibiotics to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The team behind NeoTest — which includes physician and global health research Akhil Bansal, Center for Global Development head Rachel Glennerster, economist and House of Lords member Jim O’Neill, and Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer — aims to improve that targeting by getting a better test, one that gives results within minutes and is cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="if-you-fund-it-they-will-come" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;If you fund it, they will come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The NeoTest team does not, itself, consist of medical test manufacturers. But in Glennerster and Kremer, it includes two of the inventors of a tool called an “&lt;a href="/future-perfect/21439799/covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-priority-access-covax-who"&gt;advance market commitment&lt;/a&gt;” (AMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;AMCs are a way to communicate to companies that there’s a big market for a product which doesn’t yet exist. The participants, which can include governments or other businesses or philanthropists, commit to buying a set amount of the new product, at a set price, from any manufacturers who meet the deal’s specifications. The hope is that this provides an incentive for manufacturers to develop the product, because they know for a fact there will be demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s worked before. The &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/five-nations-and-the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-launch-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines"&gt;first AMC&lt;/a&gt;, for better vaccines against pneumococcal bacteria at a time when that &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/240895/WER8212_93-104.PDF#page=4"&gt;disease was killing as many as 1 million children a year&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in three new vaccines being developed, and in the number of vaccine doses &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/evaluations/Gavi-PCV-AMC-pilot-2nd-Outcomes-and-impact-evaluation-Final-report.pdf#page=50"&gt;growing from just 3 million in 2010 to around 150 million in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. By one estimate from Kremer and co-authors, the &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26775/w26775.pdf"&gt;new vaccines enabled by the AMC&lt;/a&gt; saved some 700,000 lives between 2010 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More famously, Operation Warp Speed, the US effort that got effective vaccines against Covid-19 on the market less than a year after the pandemic began, used a purchasing mechanism that worked quite a bit like an AMC. The government &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200722152445/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/22/us-government-engages-pfizer-produce-millions-doses-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;purchased hundreds of millions of doses&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200707124316/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/07/hhs-dod-collaborate-novavax-produce-millions-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-doses-commercial-scale-manufacturing-demonstration-projects.html"&gt;vaccine manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200521122749/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/05/21/trump-administration-accelerates-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-available-beginning-in-october.html"&gt;months before&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200418081325/https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-award-us-government-agency-barda-483-million/"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were in fact approved — giving the pharma firms confidence to start producing doses in large numbers, and encouraging them to keep up their R&amp;amp;D work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test. Test manufacturers who are willing to sell for $8 per test ($5 funded by the AMC, $3 by the government of the country receiving the tests) would be guaranteed at least 24 million subsidized orders. Ideally, the test will settle at around $3 as a final price, with the initial subsidy helping fund initial costs associated with developing the tests and setting up manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A rapid test is not some outlandish dream. Neonatal sepsis experts have been saying we need better diagnostics for years; there’s a whole &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/9/e015862"&gt;Neonatal Sepsis Diagnosis Working Group that puts out papers&lt;/a&gt; explaining the problem. The WHO has put together a detailed description of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/call-for-public-consultation-target-product-profile-for-tests-of-neonatal-sepsis"&gt;what a useful rapid test for sepsis might look like&lt;/a&gt;, including elements like the size of the blood draw required and the ideal wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Rapid, point-of-care tests that can give answers in minutes are common at this point for viruses like Covid and the flu, and already exist for some &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/first-to-know-syphilis-test-kit-1-ct-prodid-625207"&gt;bacterial infections like syphilis&lt;/a&gt;. But in part because neonatal sepsis is so concentrated in poor countries, developing a test for it hasn’t been a priority for profit-driven firms to date. Dangling $120 million in front of them might change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-is-a-problem-developing-countries-could-solve-as-a-group" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;This is a problem developing countries could solve as a group&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of NeoTest to me is that Akhil Bansal, the physician who first devised the idea, is pitching it first to governments of middle- income countries (India, Kenya, South Africa, etc.) that might actually use the test in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;$120 million is a decent sum, but not enormous for a global health project. The pneumococcal AMC, by contrast, was for $1.5 billion. And it’s totally within the budgets of some middle-income countries to contribute a portion of that $120 million, especially when the result is a product that will save the lives of thousands of babies every year in their country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, money is money, and if any foreign aid professionals in upper-income countries or philanthropists reading this piece want to support NeoTest, they should — they’re still actively fundraising and are in need of support. The most important thing is that the problem gets solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But I found the approach of going first to countries directly benefiting for funding intriguing, and surprisingly heartening at what is otherwise a dark time for global health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For one thing, it’s remarkable and encouraging that enough middle-income countries have gotten to the point where funding an initiative like this is within their budgets. That wasn’t true 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More importantly, though, it serves as a reminder that the work of development will continue with or without Western governments’ support. That support is invaluable, and I hope it returns. But the Global South is resilient, and increasingly shows an ability to solve big problems for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNQjR1ZUhmMWxkVnlOOFh2dFRTR2tKOUw1R1E1OG9ON09wQzEtYktMd1g4Yk5GVW4yS0pBS29YMi1Kb0liZmtyQ2FpWW9meTJ1NW9wVk9yTzFBdEVxcERCcGRJVU9QZG4wekViR2NwemxPTl95bHNYRi1BZFRBMHVzeUc3N1Y0alV5ZENPUTI2bVU</guid></item><item><title>您的基因与环境的相互作用如何改变您的疾病风险-新的研究计算方式-对话 | How your genes interact with your environment changes your disease risk − new research counts the ways - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNMUUtZHpfdHNuaFplWTVtR3lBc3ZSemV4ZXowdmViS1VaRHBaeHFUSmEwV1BSaTJiM1IxbGhuZFhSbG5SU1NaUi1YS04ydVo0OGtNNjdmTmVfbENRNDdNSzE4ZVJEbGpSdW9OMFdmbVN4RzY1bmkzTUNwMGtCMXZUTWlEUk16RFhjbVlFSDNwYmlqSTlsSHc0cmRPWlNRVTFod2h1YXV4NlU0bEREeTVPR3NvTU9NZmNnVmJTekU4T0N2NVlyTlluUXFfUng3WUVM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting in my doctor’s examination room, I was surprised when she told me, “Genetics don’t really matter for chronic disease.” Rather, she continued, “A person’s lifestyle, what they eat, and how much they exercise, determine whether they get heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a researcher who &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;studies the genetics of disease&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t fully disagree – &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-tracking/php/data-research/lifestyle-risk-factors.html"&gt;lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt; play a large role in determining who gets a disease and who doesn’t. But they are far from the entire story. Since scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-human-genome-project-pieced-together-only-92-of-the-dna-now-scientists-have-finally-filled-in-the-remaining-8-176138"&gt;mapped out the human genome&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, researchers have learned that genetics also play a large role in a person’s disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies that focus on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3941"&gt;estimating disease heritability&lt;/a&gt; – that is, how much genetic differences explain differences in disease risk – usually attribute a substantial fraction of disease variation to genetics. Mutations across the entire genome seem to play a role in diseases such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01058-3"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0241-6"&gt;17% heritable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-02293-8"&gt;80% heritable&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Tay-Sachs-Disease"&gt;Tay-Sachs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis/causes"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, where mutations in a single gene cause a disease, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi8206"&gt;chronic diseases tend to be polygenic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they’re influenced by multiple mutations at many genes across the whole genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every complex disease has both genetic and environmental risk factors. Most researchers study these factors separately because of technical challenges and a lack of large, uniform datasets. Although some have devised techniques to overcome these challenges, they haven’t yet been applied to a comprehensive set of diseases and environmental exposures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our recently published research, my colleague &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JX656y0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Alkes Price&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; developed tools to leverage newly available datasets to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;quantify the joint effects&lt;/a&gt; that genetic and environmental risk factors have on the biology underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aspirin, genetics and colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the effect gene-environment interactions have on disease, let’s consider the example of aspirin use and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were studying how &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11325819/"&gt;regularly taking aspirin&lt;/a&gt; decreased the risk of colon cancer. They wondered whether genetic mutations that slowed down how quickly the body broke down aspirin – meaning aspirin levels in the body would stay high longer – might increase the drug’s protective effect against colon cancer. They were right: Only patients with slow aspirin metabolism had a decreased risk of colon cancer, indicating that the effectiveness of a drug can depend on a person’s genetics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of how genetics and different &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-environment-affects-how-well-your-medications-work-identifying-exactly-how-could-make-medicine-better-246476"&gt;combinations of environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, such as the medications a patient is taking, can affect a person’s disease risk and how effective a treatment will be for them. How many cases of genetic variations directly influencing a drug’s effectiveness are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Rather than ‘nature versus nurture,’ a more accurate way of describing gene-environment interactions is ‘nature through nurture.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gene-environment interaction of colon cancer and aspirin is unusual. It involves a mutation at a single location in the genome that has a big effect on colon cancer risk. The past 25 years of human genetics have shown researchers that these sorts of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08494"&gt;large-effect mutations are rare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an analysis found that the median effect of a genetic variant on height is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038"&gt;only 0.14 millimeters&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, there are usually hundreds of variations that each have small but cumulative effects on a person’s disease risk, making them hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could researchers detect these small gene-environment interactions across hundreds of spots in the genome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Polygenic gene-environment interactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by looking for cases where genetic variants across the genome showed different effects on a person’s biology in different environments. Rather than trying to detect the small effects of each genetic variant one at a time, we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;aggregated data across the entire genome&lt;/a&gt; to turn these small individual effects into a large, genome-wide effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; – a large database containing genetic and health data from about 500,000 people – we estimated the influence of millions of genetic variants on 33 complex traits and diseases, such as height and asthma. We grouped people based on environmental exposures such as air pollution, cigarette smoking and dietary patterns. Finally, we developed statistical tests to study how the effects of genetics on disease risk and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker"&gt;biomarker levels&lt;/a&gt; varied with these exposures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found three types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;19 pairs&lt;/a&gt; of complex traits and environmental exposures that are influenced by genetic variants across the genome. For example, the effect of genetics on white blood cell levels in the body differed between smokers and nonsmokers. When we compared the effects of genetic mutations between the two groups, the strength of gene-environment interaction suggested that smoking changes the way genetics influence white blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we looked for cases where the heritability of a trait varies depending on the environment. In other words, rather than some genetic variants having different effects in different environments, all of them are made stronger in some environments. For example, we found that the heritability of body mass index – the ratio of weight to height – increased by 5% for the most active people. This means genetics plays a larger role in BMI the more active you are. We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;28 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including HDL cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption, as well as neuroticism and self-reported sleeplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we looked for a type of gene-environment interaction called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;proportional or joint amplification&lt;/a&gt;. Here, genetic effects grow with increased environmental exposures, and vice versa. This results in a relatively equal balance of genetic and environmental effects on a trait. For example, as self-reported time spent watching television increased, both genetic and environmental variance increased for a person’s waist-to-hip ratio. This likely reflects the influence of other behaviors related to time spent watching television, such as decreased physical exercise. We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;15 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including lung capacity and smoking, and glucose levels and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke and the medications you take, can interact with your genes in unexpected ways.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked for cases where biological sex, instead of environmental exposures, influenced interactions with genes. Previous work had shown evidence of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00912-0"&gt;gene-by-sex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt;, and we found additional examples of the effects of biological sex on all three types of gene-environment interactions. For example, we found that neuroticism had genetic effects that varied across sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also found that multiple types of gene-environment interactions can affect the same trait. For example, the effects of genetics on systolic blood pressure varied by sex, indicating that some genetic variants have different effects in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New gene-environment models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we make sense of these distinct types of gene-environment interactions? We argue that they can help researchers better understand the underlying biological mechanisms that lead from genetic and environmental risks to disease, and how genetic variation leads to differences in disease risk between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes related to the same function work together in a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Biological-Pathways-Fact-Sheet"&gt;unit called a pathway&lt;/a&gt;. For example, we can say that genes involved in making heme – the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen – are collectively part of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537329/"&gt;heme synthesis pathway&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting amounts of heme circulating in the body influence other biological processes, including ones that could lead to the development of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17705-low-hemoglobin"&gt;anemia and cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Our model suggests that environmental exposures modify different parts of these pathways, which may explain why we saw different types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, these findings could lead to treatments that are more personalized based on a person’s genome. For example, clinicians might one day be able to tell whether someone is more likely to decrease their risk of heart disease by taking weight loss drugs or by exercising.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results show how studying gene-environment interactions can tell researchers not only about which genetic and environmental factors increase your risk of disease, but also what goes wrong in the body where.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/03/27/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has mapped the neural activity underlying lucid dreams with unprecedented precision. The researchers found that lucid dreaming produces a unique pattern of brain activity that includes altered communication between brain regions, increased gamma activity, and signatures linked to self-awareness and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreaming occurs when a person becomes aware that they are dreaming, sometimes even gaining control over the dream’s content. Though vivid and immersive, this state is neurologically complex and still poorly understood. Previous studies had proposed possible brain markers of lucid dreaming, but results were often inconsistent. Many used small samples and lacked standardized methods to clean up confounding signals such as those produced by eye movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The team led by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay-demirel-93bb50b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Çağatay Demirel&lt;/a&gt; at Radboud University Medical Center sought to overcome these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a PhD candidate nearing completion, and this project represents the largest chapter of my dissertation,” Demirel explained. “Lucid dreaming felt like a strange crack in reality—a moment where you could witness your mind from within and perhaps even take control, even when nothing else felt truly graspable. That paradox—being awake inside a dream—captivated me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, that existential curiosity evolved into a scientific pursuit. Moreover, the inconclusive results regarding electrophysiological correlates in several studies using distinct, small-sample EEG datasets highlighted the need for refinement in the field—specifically, through an EEG mega-analysis by combining various datasets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assembled a large dataset from multiple laboratories in the Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and the United States, bringing together a final sample of 26 lucid dreamers who contributed a total of 43 usable sleep recordings. These included both low-density and high-density EEG recordings, with up to 128 electrodes monitoring electrical activity across the scalp. Participants were instructed to perform a distinct sequence of eye movements (left-right-left-right) once they realized they were dreaming. This standard signal allowed the researchers to pinpoint the moment lucidity began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major innovation in the study was the development of a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline to clean the EEG data. This was essential because both spontaneous and voluntary eye movements during REM sleep can introduce artifacts that mimic brain activity, especially in the gamma frequency band (30–45 Hz). The team implemented techniques to identify and remove these saccadic artifacts using signal processing methods that worked even on low-density EEG setups. This preprocessing ensured that the signals analyzed truly reflected neural activity and not muscle movements or other noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared brain activity during lucid REM sleep to that during regular REM sleep and relaxed wakefulness. These comparisons used both broad frequency band analyses and more advanced techniques that measured brain signal complexity and functional connectivity. They found that lucid dreaming had a distinctive neural profile. While some features overlapped with normal REM sleep, such as lower alpha power and higher delta activity compared to waking, other features set lucid dreams apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key finding was a reduction in theta and beta power in certain brain regions during lucid dreams, particularly in the posterior and right temporoparietal regions of the brain. These areas are involved in attention and self-awareness, suggesting that lucid dreaming might engage neural circuits similar to those used during reflective or metacognitive thinking. At the same time, the researchers observed increased gamma activity—especially in the 30–36 Hz range—around the moment the lucid dreamer became aware. This activity was most pronounced in the precuneus and prefrontal cortex, areas linked to consciousness and internal monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses revealed that lucid dreaming was associated with greater long-range communication between brain regions, particularly in the alpha and gamma bands. These patterns involved areas of the brain known to support sensory integration, internal attention, and memory—functions likely involved in recognizing and maintaining lucidity within the dream. Notably, alpha connectivity during lucid dreams formed a network that included the superior temporal and superior frontal gyri, suggesting coordination between auditory, sensory, and executive systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signal complexity analyses also distinguished lucid dreams from other sleep states. Measures like Lempel-Ziv complexity and entropy, which quantify the unpredictability or richness of brain signals, were higher in lucid dreaming than in regular REM sleep. However, these values were still lower than in the waking state. This suggests that lucid dreaming represents an intermediate state of consciousness—one that is more organized and self-aware than typical dreaming, but still distinct from being awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t approach with any specific expectations (there is no null hypothesis in this project), as this is an almost entirely exploratory study due to the merging of large datasets from different labs,” Demirel told PsyPost. “However, the findings that captivated us most were in the source-level analyses (cortical estimation), which differ from the more traditional sensor-level EEG analyses we also applied. Sensor-level EEG patterns during lucid dreaming regarding power spectral density (PSD) analyses resemble REM sleep in statistical sense. However, source-level findings revealed heightened alpha connectivity during lucid dreaming that lies between REM sleep and wakefulness (there are evidences in the literature regarding alpha connectivity changes related to psychedelics).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also studied how brain activity changed in the moments before and after lucid dreamers signaled their awareness with eye movements. In the seconds surrounding this signal, gamma activity spiked, and large-scale increases in connectivity were seen across the cortex. These changes began just before the eye movement signal, suggesting that the brain prepares for lucidity even before the dreamer communicates it. These moments may capture the emergence of self-awareness from a non-conscious dream state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gamma activation in the precuneus around the onset of lucidity eye signaling was quite a surprising finding,” Demirel said. “Considering that this activation occurs in comparison to a baseline temporally close to the onset itself, it provides potentially conclusive patterns suggesting that the brain may simulate its own reality, reflecting self-referential awareness and possibly motor awareness. This could be interpreted as a potential sensory awakening into a simulated reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the neural mechanisms behind lucid dreaming by addressing previous methodological challenges and using both sensor-level and source-level analyses. The findings show that lucid dreaming is not simply a hybrid of dreaming and waking, but a distinct state of consciousness with its own brain dynamics. By tracking both spectral activity and functional connectivity, the researchers provide a more complete picture of how the brain supports self-awareness within a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still several open questions. Lucid dreaming remains difficult to induce in experimental settings, which means that researchers often rely on naturally occurring instances. Dream content also varies widely between participants and sessions, making it harder to isolate what aspects of the experience are most responsible for the observed brain patterns. The study also relied on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution and cannot definitively rule out the influence of residual artifacts—especially in high-frequency bands where eye movements are most disruptive. Future studies using methods like fMRI or intracranial recordings could help resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rarity of very high-density EEG combined with fMRI data—or the lack of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data—on lucid dreaming poses a major limitation for performing volumetric estimations of deep brain structures,” Demirel said. “While interesting patterns can be captured at the source level, we had to restrict our analyses to cortical estimations. Although we can detect the onset of lucid dreaming through eye signaling via electrooculogram (EOG), the actual experience likely begins earlier, and we still don’t know exactly when lucidity truly emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The limitations are shaping the goals. I am working on the development of more in-depth mathematical models to decode EEG patterns and improve sensitivity to phase shifts in non-stationary state decoding. Considering that lucid dreaming is seemingly a transient brain state, methodological reconsideration is essential to distinguish it from stationary signals. This could enable a more precise segmentation of the lucid state. I also view lucid dreaming as a tool for developing methods that could ultimately help redefine the dynamics of sleep and wakefulness, which will also indirectly support research into disorders of consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just happy that the study has finally been published after years of very draining work that, at times, felt like it would never end,” Demirel added. “I’m really excited to finally share these findings with the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Electrophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming: sensor and source level signatures&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Çağatay Demirel, Jarrod Gott, Kristoffer Appel, Katharina Lüth, Christian Fischer, Cecilia Raffaelli, Britta Westner, Xinlin Wang, Zsófia Zavecz, Axel Steiger, Daniel Erlacher, Stephen LaBerge, Sérgio Mota-Rolim, Sidarta Ribeiro, Marcel Zeising, Nico Adelhöfer, and Martin Dresler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:15:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOWkxrWFJ4N2t5ZkV5WkJ2dDRkSVVJQVVRZ0t2cTYwT1I0OE9zZWk3a2NhVTlZd1BaczdYSXhhUEJWSXIzT0FjWURRV2daQ0tRNXVjTnNWWF9ibDlhYThkbGJid3pZWjM1QnlFMXFkamtsdUlIUXdVZjU0aHRkc3R5QUtlQWQ1R192TnB6LTMySC1CVl9aNG94WVBn</guid></item><item><title>地球海洋中没有“充足的鱼”来养活100亿人，必须有所改变- Earth.com | There are not "plenty of fish" in Earth's oceans to feed 10 billion people, something must change - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNQWJIcmp1UHFQYVc3Z0NhZkc0SzFWVlZQMVNiV1JsMjhyRG90c3NJenh4ajdaQm9QMldudkgwS0hTR0xqaVFvbXdPcEgtbW9IVXh4NVFnR3hwTGRCeV9EM2RCbU9FQzUxYmZtR1M5WFRYdHhZMFlKdkdXZHJzNnJrSW1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative seafood is emerging as a vital solution in the fight to protect marine ecosystems. As pressure from overfishing, pollution, and climate change intensifies, scientists and policymakers are exploring new ways to reduce strain on the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many marine mysteries remain, one issue is clear – traditional fishing practices are pushing the ocean toward ecological collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-global-impact-of-overfishing"&gt;The global impact of overfishing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers point out that nearly 90% of marine fisheries today are either fully exploited or already overfished. On top of that, pollution and habitat degradation are erasing biodiversity across oceans, rivers, and coasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/global-industrial-fishing-footprint-spd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that commercial fishing operations now cover more than 55% of the ocean surface – four times more than the land used for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This crisis impacts people as well as marine life. Around 3 billion rely on the ocean for food and jobs. With the population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050, seafood demand is rising twice as fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wild fisheries can only do so much. Even under perfect management, there’s a ceiling on how many fish can be caught each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that reducing the burden of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/overfishing-and-habitat-degradation-have-devastated-marine-ecosystems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overfishing&lt;/a&gt; through better fishery management is possible, but it requires setting limits on how much can be caught, where and when, and with which methods. There’s another way forward – one that doesn’t get as much attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alternative-seafood-as-a-sustainable-solution"&gt;Alternative seafood as a sustainable solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative seafood – like plant-based fish or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sushi-of-the-future-the-first-ever-lab-grown-eel-is-a-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lab-grown&lt;/a&gt; (cultivated) tuna – is emerging as a powerful tool to meet demand without draining the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products can help shift consumer choices away from wild-caught fish and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/farmed-seafood-supply-is-at-risk-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;farmed seafood&lt;/a&gt; that contribute to environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers explain, plant-based and cultivated fish hold enormous potential for feeding a growing population the fish they love while easing pressure on the conventional fishing industry and, in turn, reducing harm to our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reshaping-the-seafood-industry"&gt;Reshaping the seafood industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fishing-communities-cooperate-to-survive-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just affected by climate change – it’s also a contributor. Fuel-intensive vessels and aquaculture feed production release greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But climate change is striking back. Rising ocean temperatures are pushing fish populations toward the poles, leaving tropical waters increasingly empty. Some regions could see up to a 40% drop in seafood catch potential by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, warming waters are also making seafood riskier. Infections from Vibrio bacteria, which can be deadly, are increasing worldwide. Still, there’s hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2705-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant-based and cultivated seafood&lt;/a&gt; – especially when produced using renewable energy – could offer a more climate-resilient alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diversifying-the-seafood-supply"&gt;Diversifying the seafood supply &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent whitepaper titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/climate-benefits-of-accelerating-global-production-of-alternative-seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Building climate policy momentum for alternative seafood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; highlights the potential environmental benefits of diversifying the seafood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Renewable energy is critical to realizing the climate benefits of cultivated meat and seafood. Life-cycle assessments project that emissions from cultivated meat produced with renewable energy will be in the lower range of aquaculture emissions and less than the emissions of most wild-capture,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, cultivated seafood is expected to require even less energy than cultivated red meat and poultry, in large part because seafood can be cultivated at lower temperatures than terrestrial meats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seafood-and-biodiversity-loss"&gt;Seafood and biodiversity loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ocean does more than provide seafood – it helps regulate the climate, generates oxygen, and supports global food systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But marine biodiversity is rapidly declining. A 2019 report found that human activity has significantly altered two-thirds of marine areas, up from 40% just a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollution, overfishing, climate change, and ocean acidification are driving this loss, leading to ecosystem collapse, food insecurity, and rising disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even aquaculture, which now accounts for half of global seafood production, can harm coastal habitats and disrupt ecosystems when poorly managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some fisheries and farms have adopted more sustainable practices, they haven’t kept pace with environmental pressures. Diversifying the seafood supply with alternative proteins is becoming increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New Blue Foods for Biodiversity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/New-blue-foods-for-biodiversity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; outlines how plant-based and cultivated seafood can help ease the strain. By reducing overfishing and bycatch, these alternatives give wild stocks a chance to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also help prevent habitat damage and pollution, since they require less land and don’t disturb the ocean floor. And unlike many aquaculture systems, they minimize antibiotic use, supporting microbial diversity and slowing the spread of resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-high-cost-of-tuna-popularity"&gt;The high cost of tuna popularity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bluefin-tuna-a-sushi-delicacy-will-likely-be-extinct-within-50-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuna&lt;/a&gt; is a favorite across the globe, especially in the U.S. where canned tuna is second only to shrimp in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans eat nearly one billion pounds a year. Worldwide, more than 7 million metric tons of tuna and similar species are harvested annually. That demand has consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven out of 61 known tuna species were labeled as threatened in 2011. Tuna fishing also harms other marine animals, like turtles and sharks, that get caught in the same waters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, innovation is catching up. Several companies are now creating tuna alternatives without fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alternative-seafood-companies"&gt;Alternative seafood companies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, Aqua Cultured Foods raised $5.5 million to expand its production of fungi-based seafood. Using a special fermentation process, the company creates whole-muscle seafood cuts like scallops, shrimp, and tuna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their products offer a sustainable and allergen-free option, and the new investment will help launch them in restaurants this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Canada, Konscious Foods received a $5 million investment through the PacifiCan Business Scale-up and Productivity program. This support will help the company increase production, grow exports, and create over 40 new jobs in British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company makes frozen sushi meals – including tuna avocado rolls – using Canadian-grown ingredients like quinoa, carrots, and tomatoes. They’re also working on new items, such as plant-based smoked salmon, crab cakes, and shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Austria, Berlin-based BettaF!sh partnered with supermarket chain BILLA AG to launch the TU-NAH sandwich, now available across BILLA and BILLA PLUS stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collaboration reflects a shared focus on sustainability and aims to bring plant-based seafood to more consumers across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alternative-seafood-as-a-global-opportunity"&gt;Alternative seafood as a global opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article once suggested that if you can’t find anything good from the sea, it might be better to cook something else. Thanks to alternative seafood, that “something else” no longer means compromising on flavor or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By scaling plant-based and cultivated seafood, it’s possible to feed a growing population without pushing marine ecosystems to the brink. As the researchers emphasize: “Building a better food system will require a diversity of solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternative seafood is the future of sustainable seafood. To scale this industry, we need bold innovators and committed champions – across climate, biodiversity, public health, and food security – who are ready to make it a global priority. An ocean of opportunity awaits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/"&gt;The Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt; for providing the background research for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:07:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNQWJIcmp1UHFQYVc3Z0NhZkc0SzFWVlZQMVNiV1JsMjhyRG90c3NJenh4ajdaQm9QMldudkgwS0hTR0xqaVFvbXdPcEgtbW9IVXh4NVFnR3hwTGRCeV9EM2RCbU9FQzUxYmZtR1M5WFRYdHhZMFlKdkdXZHJzNnJrSW1n</guid></item><item><title>他在56小时的手术中接受了别人的脸的礼物。接下来发生的事情很复杂-《独立报》 | He received the gift of someone else’s face in a 56-hour surgery.

It was the duration: the surgery had taken 56 hours — far longer than he’d expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talked about 36 hours,” he recalls, “so I was shocked.” He couldn’t imagine the drama that had played out in the operating room while surgeons worked against the clock to remove his existing deformities and then transfer another man’s face onto his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness had trained for years for this moment, lifting weights and doing dips and cardio so that his body would be strong enough to undergo such an extensive surgery. And yet, it would be months before he had the strength to hold a conversation without tiring, years before he felt at home in his own skin. The complications that had arisen during his operation were nail-biting. The plastic surgeon who led the operation, Dr. Samir Mardini, had tried to take a short break during those 56 hours that Andy was under, but with the adrenaline pumping and the scenes running through his mind, he found that he couldn’t switch off — so he went straight back down to theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness, now in his late thirties, remains one of only a few people in the world to have received a full face transplant. In 2006, at age 21, he attempted to take his own life with a rifle shot to the face. He survived, barely. The damage was devastating. For a decade he lived with a face that had been reconstructed, piece by piece, in a series of surgeries — functional, but far from natural. Children would point at him in the street or ask their parents what they were looking at. Adults would widen their eyes then quickly look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 eeQqqU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Andy Sandness (right, with Dr Samir Mardini who led the 56-hour surgery) has married and had children since the face transplant.

That milestone belongs to Isabelle Dinoire, a French woman mauled by her dog in 2005. But Sandness’s surgery, performed in 2016 at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, marked a quiet milestone in the American history of facial transplantation: a pivot from possibility to permanence. It was a test case not just of surgical technique, but of ethics, identity, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini says the team trained for over three years before they even had a recipient. Fifty weekends were spent in the cadaver lab with doctors, nurses and even medical photographers, painstakingly transferring the faces of dead people onto the bones of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as they prepared, they didn’t know if their efforts would come to anything. A face is not like a singular organ, where the tissue is all the same and the major veins and arteries are obvious. A face has skin; muscular tissue; parts of bone; tiny blood vessels; nerve pathways crucial for touch, sight, and the ability to swallow and eat. Eyelids, nostrils and lips come in certain sizes. Hairlines have to match up. Skin color and tone needs to be close to the recipient’s. All of these factors mean that finding a match on the donor list is close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, not far away in rural Minnesota, 21-year-old Rudy Ross compulsively took his life in earshot of his wife, Lilly, following an argument. Lilly called an ambulance immediately, but it was clear that Rudy could not be saved. What made Rudy’s death so tragic is abundantly clear — he was young and healthy, with his whole life ahead of him and no history of major disease — but it’s also what made him an ideal candidate for organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Race Against Two Clocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Rudy Ross’s body arrived at Mayo Clinic, everything was in motion. Gravely sick people who had been waiting at the top of the transplant list across the country were told that the organ they needed was on the way. In these kinds of situations, a kidney can be headed to Alaska while a liver is earmarked for Texas and a heart is needed in Pennsylvania. Each hospital sends a team to take the organ back to their waiting recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you add face transplantation into this mix, things get complicated. Rudy’s wife had been suddenly widowed. She was eight months’ pregnant. And while Rudy had agreed to donate his internal organs by ticking the requisite boxes on his drivers’ license, his face had never been promised. That had to be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families who “might be approached by the organ procurement organization to talk about the face” are usually those who already know their loved one wanted their internal organs to be given, says Dr. Mardini. “So there’s already a sort of open discussion… Your loved one has signed off on their drivers’ license that they would like to give the gift of heart donation, lung donation, kidney donation — but we have a patient at Mayo Clinic that is in need of a face. Is this something you would consider?” That topic is introduced only if the donor is a clear match, which was clearly the case for Rudy and Andy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got chills,” says Dr. Mardini, recalling how he felt when he saw Rudy’s face. The two men “could have been cousins.” After a difficult period of reflection, Lilly agreed that her late husband’s face, as well as his internal organs, could be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 IDsGF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Two side-by-side operating theaters were set up over the weekend for the face donation and transplantation.

The surgery began on Friday and continued until Monday morning&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two operations were required to be undertaken at the same time in order to transplant Rudy’s face onto Andy, and Mardini was in charge of both. The two men were placed in side-by-side operating theaters — Rudy, braindead but stabilized, and Andy, anesthetized and closely watched — and Mardini carefully removed Rudy’s face before running it into the adjoining theater and attaching it to Andy’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully removing all of the tissue surrounding the face is delicate. And preparing the recipient to receive all those veins, nerves and muscles is a procedure in itself, one that borders on the horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy’s was a significant surgery in that it involved the entire upper jaw, lower jaw, the cheekbones, the mandible and the nose and teeth and all the overlying structures,” says Mardini. “So you're talking about the nose and then lower eyelid and below, and then deep from the skin all the way down to the bone. You need to remove everything that's remaining there. That's to accommodate the donor to come in. So you're at the end of it, and you're staring at the greater vessels, the carotid and the jugular. You're staring at the tongue and the eyeballs, and everything else is gone.” It’s something that he and the rest of the team had to prepare for, not just in terms of “the technical part, but the emotional and mental part.” No one is used to seeing a living human without a face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that all this work has to be done to remove the underlying tissues also means that the operation is extremely high-pressured. There’s no going back in a face transplant, no putting the old organ back in and trying again next week with something else. Failure is quite simply catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack El Hai is an author who spent five years with Andy Sandness and his medical team, and was in the operating theater as the pioneering surgery was performed. He got to know the process intimately and interviewed multiple members of the medical team as it had happened. He remembers a moment where things got particularly tense in the operating room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a moment in the placement of the donor's face onto Andy when an important blood vessel narrowed or collapsed or went into spasms,” he says. “And it took a long time — or it seemed like forever, it was probably just a matter of minutes — but it took a while for the surgical team to figure out what was going on and why, and how to fix it. They noticed that while that blood vessel was constricting, Andy's face went white. It was obvious it wasn't getting proper blood flow. And that had to be fixed immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team struggled to work out what was happening, El Hai felt the mood in the room shift. Andy’s old, reconstructed face had been cut away. There wasn’t really a Plan B, beyond “a gaping opening in his face that somehow would've had to be patched using skin from other parts of his body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Painful Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another issue with taking a face from a donor who also has healthy organs that are waiting to be procured for other people in dire health situations: “The way it works best is to have the face donation go first,” says Dr. Mardini. “And that makes it very tricky, because you're dealing with a ‘life-giving’ operation versus a ‘life-saving’ operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, only around 50 face transplants have ever been performed. The rarity isn’t due to a lack of demand. Patients with devastating facial injuries — most often from trauma, cancer, or infection — face profound physical and social barriers. A functioning face is not just about appearance; it governs speech, eating, blinking, and expressing emotion. Traditional reconstructive surgery can require dozens of procedures and still fall short of restoring those functions. A transplant offers, in some cases, a faster route to a more complete face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the barriers are steep. These operations require staggering surgical precision: connecting those nerves, blood vessels, and bone with millimeter-level accuracy. Then there’s the immunological gauntlet. Patients must commit to a lifetime of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection — medications that can cause serious side effects, from kidney damage to cancer. Isabelle Dinoire died of a cancer related to low immunity 11 years after her own partial face transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo’s team had to prove to the organ procurement organization — and to their peers — that their procedure wasn’t a vanity project. It was an operation that could restore breathing, eating, speaking, the ability for a person to live a normal life. It was reconstructive and transformative, not simply cosmetic. Still, the optics were fragile. There was no precedence in the U.S. for prioritizing a face over a lung. And the team also had to convince their own hospital that Andy Sandness, a man who had previously attempted suicide, would work hard to make the transplant worth it, complying with a regimen of immunosuppressant drugs throughout his life and continuing the work he’d put in for years previously. That meant psychiatric assessments and social workers on top of all the other medical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different organs have different rates of depreciation, but all have a small amount of time when they remain viable after death. Keeping Rudy Ross stable enough that those other organs stayed healthy was a huge undertaking in itself. Ordinarily, the heart and lungs need to be taken within four to six hours of death, the liver within eight to twelve, and the kidneys within 24 to 36, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.donoralliance.org/newsroom/donation-essentials/what-is-the-time-frame-for-transplanting-organs/"&gt;according to the nonprofit Donor Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the face from Rudy “took longer, I think, than [Mardini] expected, more than 20 hours,” says Jack El Hai, “meaning there were other surgeons waiting in the wings to remove the other organs that the donor had given permission for them to take, and it got tense. They were getting impatient. They were worried about the health of those organs that they were waiting for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 efPIYE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="When Andy woke from the surgery, he didn't have functionality in his new face.

He had also assembled an in-house team to remove the organs immediately if Rudy Ross destabilized, who were ready to step in at a second’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the surgery was long and delicate, it worked out in the end. Rudy’s organs went on to save the lives of a number of desperate people, something that was especially important to his widow, Lilly. The details surrounding exactly how many organs were taken have not been released, to protect the privacy of the patients who received them. However, we do know that no organ was compromised by the face transplantation going ahead. That, in itself, is close to a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s Left Behind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miracles in medicine are earned, not bestowed. And Mardini’s team had worked hard to earn theirs: during their weekends in the cadaver lab, they had transferred the biggest possible face onto the smallest possible skull and vice versa; they did CAT scans and drew complex plans of bone and blood vessels in the way an architectural team might put together plans of concrete structures and plumbing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new story began for Andy Sandness when he woke up with Rudy Ross’s face. But first, Ross’s story had to come to a dignified close. Four years earlier, an expert team in developing silicone facial prosthetics had agreed to come down to the cadaver lab sessions and learn how to construct a mask of an entire face. The team had previously made lifelike prosthetic noses, eyes and ears for people with deformities or serious injuries; in the lab, they molded masks that were indistinguishable from the original faces, “with the freckles and the wrinkles and the hair,” says Mardini. Once Rudy Ross’s body arrived at the clinic, they were called in to do the job they’d trained for over a number of years. Fourteen delicate layers of material were carefully woven together and shaped, in order that his body could return to the funeral home looking recognizable, in a process that took 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly Ross had planned for a closed casket funeral after she’d agreed to her husband’s face to be transplanted onto Andy Sandness. But when the Mayo Clinic released Rudy’s body, complete with silicone mask, Mardini says they received a call from the funeral director: “He kind of paused then said: ‘I think you sent me the wrong body, because there was going to be a face donation’. And when it turned out it wasn’t the wrong body, he called up the wife and the mom and said: ‘You might want to come and visit with the body’. And they did an open casket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking Like Yourself, As Someone Else&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he has Rudy Ross’s face, Andy Sandness doesn’t look like his donor. That’s because one’s underlying bone structure is just as important for how a person’s face looks as the individual components. That was a relief for Rudy’s widow Lilly — who met with Andy a few times, although they eventually lost touch as they both moved on and had further families — and for Rudy’s mother, who Andy stayed in touch with until her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy is one of the rare people in human existence who has had three faces during his life,” says Jack El Hai. “The one he was born with, the reconstructed face, and then the transplanted face.” Such huge aesthetic changes can be a shock to the system, and psychological issues with carrying someone else’s face or limbs have led to people requesting removal in the past. “So the social workers and the psychologists led him through what they called a gradual reveal,” El Hai continues, “which meant seeing pieces, portions of his face in the mirror, a bit at a time, gradually, from a distance and up close. And this helped Andy become reconciled to his new appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 bNCEqj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-17996"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of Mayo Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Hai’s opinion, Andy — who he describes as a thoughtful and quiet man who came out of his shell after the face transplant — “looks great” these days. “I always tell people that I think he looks like Matt Damon,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness remains a private man, however, who prefers to do media interviews over email rather than in person or over the phone. Eight years after the surgery, functionality, he says, is good. He’s legally blind in his left eye but has some peripheral vision. “My nerves and feeling in my face improve daily,” he says. “But there is more I could do as far as exercises to improve what I have.” His progress has been steady but incremental, often invisible to outsiders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal work has required just as much effort as the external. When I ask him what’s overlooked about his experience, he says it’s a “complicated” question, because at first he thought he should mention the time and dedication from everyone involved that goes into a face transplant. “But the more I think about it, it’s definitely not repeating suicide to my friends, family, and doctors,” he says. When he woke up after attempting to take his own life, “I was embarrassed, humiliated, and depressed.” Over the years, he’s accrued a whole team “of psychiatrists, psychologists, and family and friends that all believed in me,” and that’s been humbling. He keeps in mind that he would never want to let them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a hard shell but a big heart,” he continues. “I will go out of my way to help people out. But I will never ask for help in return, even when I know I need it. I’m stubborn as a mule and do things how I see fit.” It’s a mentality that may have led him to suicidality when he was younger. But it’s also a mentality that he believes helped him pre-transplant: he kept going, even in circumstances many would have found unbearable. Asked if he’s an organ donor himself, he replies simply: “Of course I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini never thought he’d perform such a complex operation as a plastic surgeon. But the change in Andy Sandness’s life is clear: “He is able to swim. He is able to eat and drink in a restaurant. He is able to interact normally with people,” he says. Recently, Andy described a quiet moment that signaled, to Mardini, that he and his medical team had achieved everything they’d wanted to when they first set out, years prior, to perform the pioneering transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When he walked in an elevator, this kid and his mom walked in after him,” Mardini recalls. “The kid looked at him, looked away and kept talking to his mom. And everything was fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack El Hai’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFace-Transplant-Medical-Restored-Identity-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0C9TPLY32&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Face in The Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is published on May 20th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are based in the U.S. and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

            Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanew0gx00013b6n9gdwor07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It kept him alive, but it didn’t feel like living.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00043b6m3t98ittx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00053b6mz8gxb2yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/health/pig-kidney-transplant-clinical-trials/index.html"&gt;experimental cross-species transplant&lt;/a&gt; of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, he’s the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00073b6m67359izc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it — for him and for fellow patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00083b6m8foh7j82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will do something for humanity,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000a3b6m2szf47wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2½ years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure — his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000b3b6msczywxmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrews’ kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000c3b6m38wqpa0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a “huge burden” on the body, Andrews’ doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/702274#:~:text=Bethesda%2C%20MD%E2%80%94Patients%20with%20advanced%20kidney%20disease%20who,removed%20by%20hemodialysis%2C%20increase%20heart%20attack%20risk." target="_blank"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000d3b6mw8zvtcrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,” said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000e3b6mgr7h4b0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should “pick a box.” With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000f3b6m4t6h8t12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, he’d sleep. By the time he woke up, he’d have to start the process all over again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000g3b6mwxew95am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000h3b6mqg2kdxnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldn’t eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000i3b6mg61t1v83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the hours ticked past, he couldn’t think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000j3b6mol95kpqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldn’t let him. He also kept hearing his father’s voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000m3b6muwm2xh6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000n3b6m34na9r5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://unos.org/news/90000-people-are-waiting-for-a-kidney-heres-one-way-to-get-them-a-kidney-faster/#:~:text=Dialysis%20is%20a%20lifesaving%20treatment,day%20waiting%20for%20a%20kidney." target="_blank"&gt;Nearly 90,0000 people&lt;/a&gt; are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most don’t get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000o3b6m5xzxsd14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews’ chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000q3b6mfmcv3szq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little short there,” Andrews said. “I know what end-stage means.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000r3b6mfbnmk5j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000s3b6mu1migh6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they first met, Andrews was “very frail,” Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned what’s known as xenotransplantation — transplants using genetically modified pig organs — Andrews’ eyes “sparked.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000t3b6mx21pyge9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He said ‘Tell me what I need to do.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000v3b6m5rc5oniq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella told Andrews he’d need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000w3b6m4t7f8xht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They said, ‘Prepare your body for battle,’ ” Andrews’ wife, Karen, remembered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000x3b6mu0w9aobo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000y3b6m09f5bksv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was “almost running around the room.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmandkmvj00003b6mb5p39kcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, she’d be exposed to it, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00123b6mnbvk30gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little taken aback by that,” Karen said. But she didn’t have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00133b6muz8yae08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to be better than dialysis,” she said. “He was just feeling so awful all the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00153b6mz6vnmfzj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In January, it was finally time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00163b6mfrop1fya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00173b6mgehl3q19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went “unbelievably well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00193b6mo8eeynjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/mgh-performs-second-xenotransplant-of-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-into-living-recipient" target="_blank"&gt;team of doctors&lt;/a&gt; told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrews’ nonfunctioning organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001a3b6mjtm5s3vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,” Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001b3b6m99wl94rr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, I started bawling like a baby,” Karen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001c3b6m4mwjjubb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001d3b6m8qa25yiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001e3b6ml5hfezgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/role-hospitals-massachusetts-general-hospital-team-performs-second-xenotransplant-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-living" target="_blank"&gt;“reenergized and revitalized.”&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001f3b6m6fmfrbwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was alive, and I hadn’t been in a long time,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001g3b6m8bk9xgag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001h3b6mvrcka5bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a miracle,” Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001i3b6ml4vkhpun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said ‘look at me, it’s like I’m like a new man,’ ” he said. “It’s like new birth. I said, ‘I’ve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001j3b6mmt7enzkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001k3b6mci843jr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the months since, he’s had a few “small bumps in the road,” including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001l3b6mnq7xe1gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001m3b6m2y5z915d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications he’ll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001n3b6ms5wxs3lh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001o3b6m128588nc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He even lets himself picture a future. He can’t wait to see his grandkids again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001p3b6mbo87vneu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They saw me at the lowest, and now they’ll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001q3b6mkdjn1eid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said they’ve put it off far too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaned9de000z3b6m35ut0cwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. He’s still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first — and a success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001w3b6mvyb5rfej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he won’t be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;United Therapeutics Corp&lt;/a&gt; – the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys – announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanv2g6f00033b6nzvnkrz0b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2412747" target="_blank"&gt;March 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/pig-kidney-transplant-patient-home/index.html"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt; at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001y3b6mgnzd3kb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and it’s probably important to get patients like Andrews, who haven’t needed dialysis as long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmantqqty00003b6nnua2387k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removal/index.html"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the next month. She died in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001z3b6m4mf9tsiz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/third-pig-kidney-transplant"&gt;Towana Looney&lt;/a&gt; with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removed-longest-in-living-patient/index.html"&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; it in April when her immune system started to reject it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00203b6m5pb5qb04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looney’s had fewer. Doctors say they still don’t know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00213b6mn3jydp5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00223b6melm7sxdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is a learning curve,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00233b6mxk6poum0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the world’s organ shortage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00243b6mffsi70wv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,” he said. “Without them willing to take the risk, we wouldn’t be able to move this to the clinic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00253b6m9j2g5psa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00263b6mjkv94irk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ‘ah, I can handle that’ and everything, but it’s tough,” he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. “It was very tough to realize that was it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00273b6mndkr1yym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was going to die in this building.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00283b6mu67b6cva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00293b6mvsmye15u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I see way too many people give up,” Andrews said. “Don’t give up.”

Pictured a scan showing how the unnamed man's neck and spine had become deformed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken by his doctors revealed the vertebrae of his neck had become distorted and dislocated with scar-like tissue developing in the spine over time as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics initially tried to correct his dropped head syndrome with collars— medical devices worn around the neck that support and stabilise the head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as the patient complained of numbness while wearing the devices, this treatment was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors instead opted for a series of surgical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They first removed small segments of his vertebrae and some of the scar-like tissue that had developed in his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics then inserted a series of screws and metal rods into the bones of his neck to correct his posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months following the surgery the patient was found to be easily able to hold his head in a horizontal position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man's problems with lifting his head and swallowing had not returned during a follow-up a year later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics eventually inserted a series of screws and metal rods into the bones of his neck to correct his posture (left). The results are six months after the procedure (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts concluded that their patient's condition had likely been triggered by a combination of the long term effects of holding his neck in an awkward position while playing games on his phone and an 'underlying developmental disorder'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they urged for increased awareness of the dangers of excessive smartphone usage, paticularly as it is rising among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772964823000369#fig1"&gt;JOS Case Reports&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, the team said the patient and his family had consented to his case being published. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dropped head syndrome—also known as floppy head syndrome — is characterised by severe weakness of the neck muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most commonly associated with neuromuscular disorders such as motor neurone disease it can be triggered by other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14703851/Man-dropped-head-syndrome-addiction.html"&gt;substance abuse&lt;/a&gt;, with Iranian medics recently detailing a case involving a 23-year-old man who developed the condition after using amphetamine for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shandong researchers suggest that edible and medicinal fungi contain bioactive components with therapeutic potential for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Findings offer evidence for the potential of these fungi to serve as novel pharmaceuticals or functional foods in the treatment of CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) diseases involve complex pathophysiology, gradual symptom onset, and significant challenges in therapeutic evaluation. Aging populations and increasing life and work stress have contributed to a rising incidence of conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and depression, which are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological development in CNS diseases remains limited, with existing treatments that do not halt disease evolution but only relieve symptoms. Adverse effects and incomplete mechanistic understanding further complicate drug discovery efforts in this area, resulting in lower success rates compared to other therapeutic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edible and medicinal fungi have been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Certain fungi contain polysaccharides, steroids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids with documented antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Recent studies have examined these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bioactive+components/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bioactive components&lt;/a&gt; as potential therapeutic agents for CNS diseases, with specific compounds reported to target oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "New Dawn of Edible and Medicinal Fungi: Unlocking Central Nervous System Diseases," &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.70230" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review of an untold number of previous studies to assess the therapeutic potential of bioactive components in edible and medicinal fungi for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Studies on Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps militaris, and Hericium erinaceus were reviewed, focusing on reported neuroprotective effects, antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory activities, and gut-brain axis interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects were reported for bioactive components in Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps militaris, Hericium erinaceus, and Antrodia camphorata. Studies on Ganoderma lucidum addressed the role of deacetyl ganoderic acid F in regulating microglial and astrocytic activity. Selenium peptides from Cordyceps militaris were linked to modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in preclinical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antrodia camphorata alcohol extracts (AC-AE) were reported to reduce infarct size and increase antioxidant levels in ischemic stroke models. Hericium erinaceus was associated with regulation of monoamine neurotransmitters and anti-inflammatory pathways in studies of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi connected to traditional Chinese medicine were found to contain bioactive components that could serve as candidates for the development of pharmaceuticals and functional foods targeting CNS diseases. Neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects suggest potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize the need for further studies to validate the efficacy of specific compounds, and dosage optimization, under controlled experimental conditions. Standardization of extraction methods and comprehensive safety assessments are recommended to advance the clinical applicability of these fungi-derived bioactive components.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, "As the global health business continues to grow and human health awareness gradually increases, edible and medicinal fungi are becoming more and more popular due to their special benefits, increasing medicinal value, and steadily rising industrialization level."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As additional context from the ever-skeptical writer of this article with an admitted blindspot for believing supplement health claims (i.e., a medicine cabinet full of unverified mechanisms in edible wish form), the Chinese government continues to promote the strategic integration of the traditional Chinese medicine industry with Western pharmaceuticals under the "Healthy China 2030" initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy emphasizes combining traditional Chinese medicine with Western pharmaceuticals as an adjunct treatment for chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and various other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach this goal, a nationwide traceability system has been established, covering seeds, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/raw+materials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;raw materials&lt;/a&gt;, herbal production, documenting formulations and finished products along with advanced manufacturing and testing facilities to better adhere to Western Good Manufacturing Practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has put a great deal of support into research with a specific predetermined goal of finding applications for traditional Chinese medicine; essentially, starting with an existing compound, finding its Western therapeutic value, and linking it to a disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional medicinal compounds cultivated for thousands of years will likely be found to contain useful bioactive components, it is just as inevitable that the research pipeline as constructed will include selection or confirmation biases. All research funded within this pipeline will require outside experimental verification, mechanistic understanding and registered clinical trials to confirm the existence of any potential effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from the &lt;strong&gt;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)&lt;/strong&gt; has shown that long-term retinal regeneration in mammals is possible. This development holds the potential to restore vision for millions suffering from retinal diseases, a condition that affects over &lt;strong&gt;300 million people&lt;/strong&gt; globally. For years, retinal degeneration, such as that seen in &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, has been a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Now, researchers have taken a significant step toward reversing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A breakthrough in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists at KAIST, has successfully demonstrated the regeneration of retinal cells in mice, a species that shares many biological traits with humans. This study, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58290-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, builds on decades of research into the regenerative abilities of animals like zebrafish. Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regrow retinal cells after an injury. However, the challenge for mammals, including humans, is that their central nervous system lacks the capacity for such regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers focused on &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which support retinal neurons. In zebrafish, these cells are able to reprogram themselves into retinal neurons after an injury. Unfortunately, mammals do not possess this regenerative ability. The breakthrough at KAIST involved manipulating a protein called &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, which typically prevents the development of new retinal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By suppressing PROX1 in mice, the team was able to stimulate the growth of new retinal neurons, effectively bypassing the limitations that have long hindered mammalian retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo courtesy of KAIST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The role of PROX1 in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt; plays a crucial role in preventing retinal cell regeneration in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/this-80000-year-old-tool-shouldnt-exist-neanderthals-werent-supposed-to-build-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79904" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;. It had been known that this protein accumulates in &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; after retinal damage, where it suppresses the development of new retinal cells. Interestingly, this inhibitory process does not occur in zebrafish, which explains their ability to regenerate retinal tissue. By blocking &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers were able to override this suppression in mice, leading to sustained retinal regeneration for &lt;strong&gt;six months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This long-term regenerative response was a first in the field of mammalian retinal regeneration. The results of this study could have profound implications for treating retinal diseases such as &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, where the photoreceptor cells in the retina deteriorate over time, leading to blindness. If this method can be adapted for human use, it would mark a major advancement in regenerative medicine and provide new hope for people affected by these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo courtesy of KAIST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing zebrafish and mammalian retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery builds on the remarkable regenerative capabilities of animals like zebrafish, which are able to reprogram their &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; into functional retinal neurons following injury. Zebrafish and other animals, such as amphibians, have been known to regenerate parts of their central nervous system, including retinal tissue. This ability has made zebrafish a model organism for studying retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, mammals have evolved to lack this regenerative capacity. The difference between these species lies in the molecular pathways that govern tissue regeneration. For years, scientists have been trying to identify which proteins or pathways could be manipulated to trigger similar regenerative processes in mammals. The work at KAIST, which targets &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, offers a potential solution to this problem, showing that a simple genetic alteration can lead to the regeneration of retinal neurons in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving forward with human applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study offers a promising direction for future research into retinal regeneration and vision restoration. Scientists have already begun exploring ways to apply the findings from this study to human retinal diseases. With conditions like &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/strong&gt; affecting millions, the ability to regenerate retinal cells could provide a revolutionary treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also considering how this technique might be integrated with other advancements in retinal treatment, such as &lt;strong&gt;gene therapy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;stem cell therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;laser-based technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. The progress made in this study is a significant step forward, and it brings hope that one day, it may be possible to regenerate retinal tissue in humans and reverse the effects of blindness caused by retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Delicious, right? Now imagine that same treats doing wonders for your heart by lowering your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers from the University of Surrey, these tasty treats seem to be more than indulgences – they could help maintain blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, zeroes in on flavan-3-ols – plant compounds found in cocoa, tea, apples, and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings? Regular consumption of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-chocolate-survive-dna-research-may-help-save-cacao-trees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; may lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function. Who knew heart health could taste so good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-foods-that-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Everyday foods that lower blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols may sound like something you’d find in a chemistry lab, but they’re actually hiding in your kitchen. These natural compounds are abundant in everyday foods like tea, dark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, and apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 145 randomized controlled trials, and the results were intriguing. People who consumed more flavan-3-ols had lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist – in some cases, the effects of these compounds were comparable to certain blood pressure medications. Imagine getting a similar result from a cup of tea as you would from a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-tea-and-chocolate-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Can tea and chocolate lower blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hot mug of tea, a piece of dark chocolate melting in your mouth  – it sounds too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t suggest swapping medicine for a snack. But it does raise an interesting point: Certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; could play a supportive role in managing cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high blood pressure saw the most significant benefits from flavan-3-ols. The takeaway? The foods you love might just love you back – if you consume them in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-beyond-blood-pressure"&gt;Benefits beyond blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure wasn’t the only focus of this study. The researchers also took a closer look at the endothelium – the inner lining of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the gateway for blood flow. When the endothelium functions well, blood flows smoothly. When it doesn’t, the risk of heart disease rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols seemed to strengthen this crucial lining, even in participants whose blood pressure didn’t budge. That means a square of dark chocolate or a few apple slices could potentially protect your heart in ways you can’t see but your body will feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Christian Heiss, a cardiovascular medicine expert at the &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt; and the study’s lead author, is cautiously optimistic about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes,” said Professor Heiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tea-and-chocolate-won-t-replace-meds"&gt;Tea and chocolate won’t replace meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start piling up chocolate bars or guzzling gallons of tea, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tea-bags-release-millions-of-plastic-particles-during-brewing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caveat&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Heiss emphasizes that this study doesn’t give the green light to ditch your prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-too-much"&gt;How much is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how much flavan-3-ols do you need to see a benefit? The study doesn’t provide a magic number. A cup of tea, a small square of dark chocolate, or a handful of grapes might do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep it real – too much of anything can backfire. More chocolate doesn’t mean more health benefits. Balance is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark chocolate and tea might get all the attention, but other foods are just as rich in flavan-3-ols. Apples, grapes, and even cocoa powder pack a punch. The trick is to incorporate a variety of these foods into your diet – not just the ones that taste like dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study might open the door, but it doesn’t close the case. The researchers are far from finished – they’re just getting started. They want to keep peeling back the layers, uncovering how flavan-3-ols really work over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these compounds have the same impact on people with various health conditions? How much is enough to make a difference without overdoing it? And could something as ordinary as a cup of tea or a piece of dark chocolate eventually earn a spot in public health recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions hang in the air, unanswered but compelling. The study may have given us a glimpse, but the full picture is still coming into focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, every sip, every bite, every moment of mindful indulgence could be another clue in the unfolding story of how simple foods might carry profound possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea and dark chocolate – not miracle cures, yet far more than mere indulgences. This study reveals how ordinary foods might carry extraordinary benefits for our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf173/8092214?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 11:35:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNR1JmcmlQeDdOYWpyQi11UTRMSkNnLXIwSWRscnMyNWF6MmxGU21tS2ZmMkNOOXZfTy10TVEwdzZZV25LQWN6b1V5RmZTWEM2alJXSVJfVVNKcFNiZVRWeUcyQ0pzVzVnRlg3M2lwMFItdFhod0FrczZwU3FFUm1fWVQ2NnQ3YVQ0RFI2a0M0SFRvS2Jm</guid></item></channel></rss>
