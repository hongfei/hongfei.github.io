In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a brand of pedometer was launched called the manpo-kei, which translates as "10,000-step meter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this figure was "taken out of context" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Lancet study analysed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cardiovascular disease - down 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cancer - down 6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;dementia - down 38% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;and depression - down 22%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For most health conditions, the benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps although there were additional advantages to walking further for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person is holding a smartphone displaying a fitness tracking app while wearing white headphones and a smartwatch." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Counting daily steps has become a popular pastime with fitness trackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most exercise guidelines focus on time spent doing physical activity over step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to the dentist, you’re likely focused on matters like cavities and gum health. But dental experts can detect a lot more from your exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot about someone’s overall health can be observed just by looking in their mouth,” &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk&lt;/em&gt;, told HuffPost. “In fact, over 100 systemic conditions and many medications can have oral manifestations. This means that what happens in the mouth can often be a window into broader health issues, helping to identify problems before they escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the mouth is considered the “gateway” to the body, it can also be the origin of problems in many different bodily systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth’s microbes “can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or open root canals and travel to other parts of the body, causing infections or inflammation,” Hoss noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why routine dental checkups are so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comprehensive oral examination can provide valuable insights into a person’s overall health and lifestyle habits, helping dental professionals identify potential issues and provide appropriate care and recommendations,” said cosmetic dentist &lt;a href="https://mymanhattancosmeticdentist.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael J. Wei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly can a dentist infer about you from the state of your mouth? We asked some professionals to share what they’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Floss Regularly... Or Rarely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxORjB5WjkteWZ1NjVQTnA1ai1nVUgzVWpXNUQ5d3dXQ0k5X1FmVVNpdV9qaFdoU0lOQVU4bVZyZ05vcVFGVEFsdUFPeUd3OVJTNlI0LU9lUWhOMldidUZhYWxLaG5vaWpvc1V1aHZnS2lTVEhSYjdUekpERmZNaUZyTHE4aGlrMGtvaEEybGpKZTg2Z2pGTlJrNjBLdENzQ0NWcGJkdUExWURLS2ctQ3ZWTEdrN1c</guid></item><item><title>香蕉和苹果都没有：科学家揭示了最健康的水果，以及为什么你应该每天吃它。- evidencenetwork.ca | Neither banana nor apple: scientists reveal the healthiest fruit of all and why you should eat it every day. - evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxOY0VteTNLR2c3Wm9GVVJ5WUxUZTlkcTVoUS1odDZzMFNpQ2N3LVBxQ1NFTGN4M3JsVmExV3VYNTZJTGZYNkc1ZjctRnpONG41amE2MU12MmRhLUVWcHlnbllsdGZGU2x5TGNDbk9CVXprSGlzbUlBRmxrODNiZjdtTmdrR21oN0VhVkR4WW1CaUF1SUxOay1ZV3pvWlNFamtrZHhOTDF1ZjZuRGUxQ0VmdmcyZmRtUE5pNkRBTWkwXzdqZXB3MjhiVTlST181Qm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A small quantity of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an asset. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some people are put off by the acidic taste of lemons, there are simple ways of incorporating them into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional in the event of digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, anti-microbial and even anti-cancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/minimum-amount-exercise-prevent-cancer-100000993.html" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says.

This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-thing-never-ever-long-175000702.html" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you. For example, for some people that may involve taking the stairs over the elevator or &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/one-change-walks-more-effective-192500444.html" data-ylk="slk:going on walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;going on walks&lt;/a&gt; with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Kowey, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/simple-hydration-trick-wish-knew-110000260.html" data-ylk="slk:staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,&lt;/a&gt; is important to prevent increased blood viscosity that can increase the chances of a clot.

"The effect of the medicine goes away, and people tend to go back to where they started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Patients who had taken GLP-1s tended to lose more weight during treatment, which meant they had more weight to gain back afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It’s not that the medicine didn’t work,” Aronne said. “It’s that they lost more weight, so they had more weight to regain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Even participants who continued healthy eating and exercise habits after stopping medication experienced weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That doesn’t mean those efforts weren’t worthwhile, Aronne further explained, but rather that obesity is a chronic disease with complex biological drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You wouldn’t stop insulin and expect a person’s blood sugar to stay low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers noted several limitations, including a small number of included studies and a focus on weight and BMI without tracking other health markers like blood sugar or cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These medications may not right for everyone, and decisions about starting or stopping should be made with your doctor, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html" target="_blank"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People with certain medical conditions, including a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer, may not be good candidates, and should speak with their doctor to decide what management strategies are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Alexandra-Elise Dakaud Patterson, MD, MS, is a general surgery resident at &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.utoledo.edu/policies/utmc/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Toledo Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOSlhQSk51Q3o3Nml4T2hTSFJqRVR0cTUzVUFoXzhtT0s4MWNnZFlaNlcxYm9kX1BfbVBBdTBXeEtlY19ualRiUk5ZeWhSRUZqeVlyZy1Qb016N19jREpCSG5zMVEtQnlSMUs4VzhTOGFRZ3VCYThuOVRyZDZidjVZT01XdW80a3BJVkxsUTllRndmZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxQbmlWcUs5emRzQ3BWaFdWTm5MSWhsal8tVUtFeGdWbk9MTVJrdGdvdVc1Y3phcUU0ZjF0cXo3Z1pTb1R3YnlXbHJLZzlSYnRvWFYwYTZUQ2t6NGJ0QmdXOExRdjkwcVd5UDBNc2o5eDB0OUI0MlpORjlPY0x2ZVgyUkRHS1M5NFQ5Um0tZEtmZkdYbWwtRXg4</guid></item><item><title>几个月来，医生对女性的常见症状不屑一顾......直到他们发现她患有致命的结肠癌-每日邮报 | Doctors dismissed woman's common symptoms for months... until they discovered she had a deadly colon cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-5372d5f0-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; woman was diagnosed with deadly &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5369d540-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; after being dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rylie Toomey, 27, was in the midst of planning her wedding and training for a half marathon when she was struck with unbearable abdominal pain in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She rushed to the hospital, where doctors performed a CT scan and insisted she was just constipated before sending her home.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told her the same thing when she returned every few months for testing, until she ended up in the emergency department screaming in pain this past April. She was also suffering from a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'In my head I was like, I think I'm going to die - that's how much pain I was in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I was being stabbed, and my belly was super bloated, too. It felt like I was just going to explode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey had suffered a perforated bowel, meaning there was a hole in her intestinal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that hospital visit, another CT scan detected stage four colon cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs - and she became one of the thousands of young Americans who have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;been diagnosed with colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; despite living healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rylie Toomey, pictured here with her fiance, was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer at 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey is one of the thousands of healthy Americans under 50 to be struck by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/woman-colon-cancer-symptoms-dismissed-rcna219654"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'When you hear, "You have cancer," you're just like, that can't be right. That can't be me because leading up to this, I was so healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To hear that I had colon cancer just didn't make sense, just because you feel like colon cancer is linked to unhealthy people or people who eat unhealthy or the elderly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just was not expecting that at all.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1999 to 2018, the rate of colorectal cancer in the under-50 population rose from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses in 20- to 34-year-olds is set to increase by 90 percent between 2010 and 2030, and rates for teenagers have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14623503/common-healthy-superfood-cancer-link-surge-rates.html"&gt;diet, lack of exercise and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; have all been blamed, though these causes fail to explain why physically fit people like Toomey have increasingly been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest evidence, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;published in April&lt;/a&gt;, also suggests childhood exposure to a toxin released by E. coli bacteria could increase the risk of colorectal cancer by triggering inflammation and altering the balance of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14659567/habit-millions-daily-colon-cancer-death-rate-study.html"&gt;linked to colorectal cancer &lt;/a&gt;in a recent study, as it is thought to block tumor-suppressing cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told TODAY.com that she regularly plays lacrosse, runs and cycles and sticks to a healthy diet. She also has no family history of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey, here with her fiancé, is having treatment and has pushed her wedding back a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed like Toomey, after a bowel-related emergency often caused by the tumor growing, recent research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is now receiving chemotherapy every two weeks and regular immunotherapy infusions, with eight treatments left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment forced her to push back her wedding, which was supposed to take place last month, and schedule it for June 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It's definitely something that keeps me going right now. It's kind of hard to stay positive in situations like this, but this is something that's bringing me joy and keeping me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Friends have &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rally-for-rylie-support-rylies-fight-against-colon-cancer"&gt;set up a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is also urging other young people with symptoms to get checked out immediately and push for answers, even if doctors are dismissive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I just don't want anybody to ever go through something like this.

              &lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;What if you could lose weight with a drug that won’t make you lose your lunch at the same time? New research shows it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Kentucky, and other institutions say they’ve found a potentially novel way to suppress people’s appetite and treat obesity—without causing the nausea or vomiting commonly experienced with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy). In early animal experiments, the team’s experimental drug appears to be working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs&lt;/a&gt; mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which is important to regulating our insulin production and hunger. As effective as these medications are at helping people lose weight, they have their tradeoffs—most notably a high chance of gastrointestinal side effects. So there’s clearly still a need for improved obesity treatments, according to lead study author Caroline Geisler, an assistant professor at UKY’s College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geisler and her team have been exploring one particular strategy for treating obesity, involving a protein called octadecaneuropeptide, or ODN. ODN is produced by the brain’s glia, specialized cells that support neurons. But glia aren’t just the brain’s support troops, and ODN seems to be important to controlling our sense of hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Now we know that [glia] play a large role in sensing and communicating the status of the body, and we hope that by targeting a glial signaling molecule, we can engage many energy-regulating pathways in the brain and avoid the side effects of nausea and vomiting,” Geisler told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers first tested their hypothesis by delivering ODN directly to the hindbrain of rats. Once treated, the rats lost weight and improved their blood sugar control. And when they blocked ODN signaling in rats, the animals exhibited a weaker response to GLP-1 treatment (suggesting its effects are at least partly tied to ODN).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, they indirectly dosed mice, rats, and shrews with an experimental drug derived from ODN, called TDN. In mice, TDN improved blood sugar control; in rats, it caused weight loss without nausea or vomiting; and in shrews (animals commonly used to test motion sickness and vomiting), the drug triggered no puking at all. The drug also appeared to not have any noticeable effects on the animals’ heart rate, movement, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This paper shows for the first time that giving a smaller version of ODN in the periphery is still effective to improve body weight and metabolic control without side effects,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu6764"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine, are only a proof of concept for now. There remain many questions about exactly how ODN works in the brain to tamp down our appetite and control blood sugar. It’s also possible that ODN-based drugs can be further optimized for medical use, though TDN seemed to produce steady weight loss in animals for at least over a week without waning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers are hopeful this potential new drug class can match or even surpass the effectiveness of today’s GLP-1 therapies while being less of a hassle to take. And they’re now planning to develop such drugs for testing in people. “We have an optimistic timeline that we could be ready to start clinical trials within 2 years,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers are hardly the only ones working to introduce the next generation of improved obesity and diabetes treatments. But it’s likely plenty of people would sign up for a safe weight loss drug that comes without the need for a barf bag.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

This caused mice to suffer MS-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness, loss of movement and the ability to coordinate muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This mirrors the process observed in individuals with multiple sclerosis, where the myelin sheath also degrades because the immune system misfires and starts to attack the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say their findings could indicate a link between HSV-1, which is different from the HSV-2 virus that causes genital herpes, and MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deepak Shukla, a professor of molecular virology at UIC and the study’s lead, said: 'Our findings enhance our understanding of how viruses develop and offer potential avenues for mitigating viral-induced [nerve cell] damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are infected, then your immune system is constantly locked in battle with the virus. And if for any reason you become immunocompromised, the virus can escape and damage your brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have warned over a potential connection between oral herpes and multiple sclerosis (stock image, there is no suggestion that the above patient has herpes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral herpes is an extremely common condition that infects about 47 percent of adults, according to the CDC, or 124million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread via sexual contact, such as kissing and oral sex, and is incurable, normally lying dormant and triggering occasional flare-ups of sores on and around the mouth and lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cells, it is controlled by the protein optineurin, which stops an infection from spreading and protects against any potential myelin sheath damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have previously established that one of the biggest risk factors for MS is an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a virus that has infected 95 percent of adults and which is estimated to raise the risk of MS by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And other herpes viruses, like the ones that cause chickenpox, shingles, and human herpes virus 6, have also been linked to the onset and worsening of MS, which affects 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And MS is a debilitating, incurable autoimmune condition that affects the brain and spinal cord and leaves people with mobility issues, memory loss and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In earlier studies, Dr Shukla’s team found that HSV-1 triggered a strong immune response in the brains of mice, causing memory problems, poor coordination, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that the protein optineurin helps fight the virus by slowing its growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest study, researchers infected mice that could not produce the protein with the oral herpes virus in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers only tested herpes simplex virus-1, or the virus that causes oral herpes. This differs from the one that causes genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As seen in earlier cell tests, mice without optineurin had higher infection rates after four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that a protein called MLKL, or Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein, which is made by the body during cell death, boosted HSV-1 infections in the absence of optineurin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the protein facilitated the transportation of the virus into a cell's nucleus, speeding an infection, and optineurin controlled HSV-1 infection by triggering the deterioration of MLKL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Imaging studies revealed extensive clumping, or aggregation, of MLKL in the brains of optineurin-lacking mice, but not in control mice, in response to HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, these clumps appeared to trigger the death of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, or cells that create armor, or the myelin sheath, around neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the sheath, the nervous system was left vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting damage disrupts the communication between the brain and the rest of the body, leading to the various symptoms associated with MS, such as weakness in the legs, fatigue, coordination problems, cognitive changes, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Identifying this protein offers a new target for multiple sclerosis therapies. Already, Shukla’s lab has demonstrated that necrosulfonamide, which inhibits optineurin, can preserve nerve function in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies like these provide hope for the future of MS, and bring about the potential to enable earlier intervention or a possible cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Goode will compete in October in Chicago. As part of his preparation, he has focused more on lifting and less on cardiovascular exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c2f8e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Instead of doing 45 minutes of strength training and 30 of cardio, it’s more like an hour strength training and maybe 15 minutes cardio,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d4c9d" class="body-graf"&gt;This caused him to gain some weight, and he’s now at 210 pounds, but it’s “more muscle.” His diet has changed, too, and he focuses on counting macronutrients. He still eats a lot of protein, but with lower-fat foods and now incorporates complex carbohydrates into his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad7ca6" class="body-graf"&gt;Losing fat while gaining muscle has changed his outlook on calories and how important they are for energy, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2fd10b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1759"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg" alt="Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Goode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-768d16" class="body-graf"&gt;Since losing weight and transforming his body with lifting, Goode feels he’s become “more emotionally intelligent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b147" class="body-graf"&gt;“I share a lot more about myself,” he says. “I’m 20 times more confident than I have ever been in my life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9397c2" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead, Goode shares what worked for him when it came to transforming his body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-122586" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Nutrition Is Going To Be Your Biggest Thing’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b4ee1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating fewer calories than he burned, what’s known as a calorie deficit, helped Goode shed the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7e8d6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Nutrition is going to be your biggest thing,” he says. “The biggest advice as far as actually losing weight is just (being in) a calorie deficit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-90506a" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Fall in Love with the Small Wins’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13713b" class="body-graf"&gt;Focusing too much on the scale can feel overwhelming.

But of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the 70 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the United States over the past 18 months, only a single death occurred, leaving experts &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/02/bird-flu-h5n1-mild-cases-mystery/"&gt;puzzled at how to explain the phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study published Wednesday adds weight to an argument that the immunity people have developed to the virus that caused the most recent flu pandemic, an H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009, has induced some cross-protection that may be making it harder for H5N1 to infect people, and mitigating the severity of the ensuing disease when such infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw4856" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, reports on a number of studies done in ferrets, the closest animal model for what happens when humans are infected with influenza. It showed that while H5N1 is lethal to ferrets with no immunity to influenza, animals that have previously been infected with influenza A — either H3N2 or H1N1 — appear to have some protection when they are later exposed to the bird flu virus. The protection is particularly strong with H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seema Lakdawala, one of the authors of the study, said the findings provide hope that, should H5N1 — long considered a major pandemic threat — acquire the ability to spread easily to and among humans, the resulting pandemic might not be as disastrous as people have feared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, most people will not die when they come into contact with the virus because they have some prior H1 immunity from infection or an H3N2 immunity from infection,” Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology and co-director of Emory University’s Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens, told STAT in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Traditionally influenza research in ferrets has been done in naive animals — those that have never been exposed to flu viruses. But increasingly scientists are using animals that have experienced previous flu infections, because they more closely resemble what might happen with humans during infection. People experience numerous exposures to flu viruses — or flu vaccines — over the course of a lifetime, building up an array of immune defenses to the ubiquitous viruses. But flu viruses evolve constantly, acquiring the ability to evade human immunity in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this study, which was done primarily by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University, blood from ferrets that had recovered from infection with one type of flu virus — H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B — was studied to see if the animals had developed antibodies that would react to and potentially protect against H5N1 viruses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, animals were sequentially infected with various combinations of two of the three types of viruses, to see if some combinations developed more robust immunity to H5N1 than others. Influenza B viruses appeared to offer no protection, but ferrets infected with the two influenza A viruses fared better against H5N1, which is also a flu A virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the surface proteins of H1N1, the neuraminidase or N in its name, bears some similarities to the neuraminidase carried by H5N1 viruses, leading some experts to theorize that it might offer some cross-protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/1/23-0756_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A study published last year&lt;/a&gt; by scientists in Hong Kong explored the idea, looking for antibodies that recognized H5N1 in the blood of people who had been infected with the H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009. Most of the samples tested had high levels of cross-reacting antibodies. By comparison, fewer than half of blood samples stored from before the 2009 pandemic had low levels of antibodies that responded to H5N1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of that paper, said the new research and other recent studies support the idea that previous infection with H1N1 induces some protection against H5N1. But this study cannot determine what the mechanism for that protection is, he noted. More research on this is needed, Peiris said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Troy Sutton, one of the senior authors of the new paper, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say to you ‘This is the protein. This is the magic one,’” Sutton, a virologist and associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State, said in an interview. “When you get infected with a flu virus, there are multiple immune mechanisms involved in clearing that virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While all of the experts who spoke with STAT about the paper described the research in glowing terms, not everyone is convinced human immunity to the seasonal flu virus H1N1 explains the relative lack of severe disease in the H5N1 infections in the U.S. over the past year and a half, as the virus has moved through dairy cattle and poultry operations in multiple parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a leading influenza scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is among those who are skeptical, pointing to H5N1 infections in Cambodia, which has reported &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON575#:~:text=Between%201%20January%20and%201,influenza%20A(H5N1)%20virus." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;27 cases since 2023&lt;/a&gt;, 12 of which have been fatal. The version of the virus circulating in that country is different from the one that has been infecting cows and poultry in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawaoka believes a number of other factors may explain differences in the severity of cases, including differences in the viruses, the way dairy workers and poultry cullers are being infected — often, it seems, with virus entering their eyes — or the ages and underlying health of the people who are being infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, a flu expert who heads the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/global-impact/influenza-research-response/world-health-organization-collaborating-center-influenza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collaborating center on influenza in animals&lt;/a&gt; at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, shares Kawaoka’s views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to downplay the study because it’s an important study. But it’s just explaining a part of the puzzle. It’s absolutely not explaining everything we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that seasonal influenza viruses transmit just fine in the human population where there is a lot of preexisting immunity. So preexisting immunity in its own right is not enough to prevent an influenza virus from transmitting through the population.” &lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/div&gt;
						
					&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;Still, Webby acknowledged that some protection from H1N1 may be helping to keep H5N1 from making more inroads into humans. “It may be critical at this early stage where there’s a very high barrier that the virus has to overcome to infect humans. And having this preexisting immunity just makes it that little bit higher than it would be in its absence,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study as well as experts who were not involved with the work all agreed that regardless of whether immunity to H1N1 is helping to protect people from H5N1, it would be unwise to assume the threat from the bird flu virus has been vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Sutton and Peiris noted that the last two flu pandemics — the 1968 H3N2 pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic — emerged at a time when most humans had some immunity to either part of the pandemic virus or to a related virus. Prior to 1968, H2N2 viruses circulated. And prior to 2009, different H1N1 viruses circulated for 80 of the previous 91 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pandemics — the 2009 pandemic and the 1968 pandemic — both those pandemics occurred in the context of widespread preexisting immunity,” Sutton noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lakdawala also pointed out that while ferrets can answer some questions about influenza, they cannot fully replicate what would happen if a new flu virus entered a population of humans, infecting the old and the young, people battling cancer, or chronic illnesses like diabetes or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Sutton noted that flu viruses are always changing, which could mean something seen now, with contemporary versions of the virus, might only be true now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this work to me says, yes, preexisting immunity seems to be a factor in protecting against infection and disease, the virus with a few changes could potentially get around that,” he said. “These viruses have very clearly shown an ability to expand their host range.

Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor (if possible), followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The disease &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/john-mccain-brain-cancer-journey-glioblastoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is considered a highly invasive tumor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;is considered a highly invasive tumor&lt;/a&gt; in the central nervous system because its cells reproduce extremely quickly. Those who are diagnosed with the malignant tumor have a median survival rate of about 14 to 14.5 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his diagnosis, Trotman was referred by a friend to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at University College London Hospitals (UCLH). There, Dr. Paul Mulholland, a consultant medical oncologist, recruited Trotman to be the first patient in his clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved him receiving the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab to treat his glioblastoma before undergoing any standard treatment. Afterward, Trotman began radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” Mulholland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Ben and Emily Trotman&lt;/p&gt; Ben and Emily Trotman on their wedding day in 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months after being the sole participant in the clinical trial, Trotman, now 43, is tumor-free, and his scans have come back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumour that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland explained. “We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumour at bay, and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulholland added that his goal is to find a cure for the “devastating disease” that is glioblastoma, and he’s hoping to move forward with additional patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trotman is now married to wife Emily, and the couple welcomed daughter Mabel in April. The couple told the hospital that the clinical trial gave Trotman his life back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” Emily said. “We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. Had we not met Dr. Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We obviously don’t know what the future holds, but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,” Trotman added. “We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new father said he’s hoping that his brain cancer journey will give others hope and inspire more patients to participate in the next clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/p&gt; Dr. Paul Mulholland and Dame Siobhain McDonagh&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/people/id6740392789" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The PEOPLE App&lt;/a&gt; is now available in the Apple App Store!

I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret’s Trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullholland recalled meeting Margaret. “When I met Margaret, she said to me, ‘What can I do to support you to cure this disease?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am incredibly grateful to her and to Siobhain, whose campaigning and fundraising in her sister’s memory has led to this new clinical trial opening for patients with this most aggressive form of brain cancer that has such a poor prognosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-s-deadly-brain-tumor-vanishes-after-taking-breakthrough-drug-11776891" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5MWWp3UXNxazkwU2dXQmlialVmSWNueVNBcUgzZHFXZmZNdEFVQWJFQ2VvR1dtb3BCeHg1TGVMSm93Ymp5ZGgxdVExcmtUTURqTGdGb001cHV1OHphdVkxYTZKZEdLNS1TREsyQ3RoODh0Sk5qOVBBVmJQOFY</guid></item><item><title>医院表示，儿童在感染脑吞噬变形虫后死亡- WSB-TV | Child dies after contracting brain-eating amoeba, hospital says - WSB-TV</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSB-TV</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:56:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生发现最致命癌症之一的新预警信号--《每日邮报》 | Doctors discover a new early warning sign for one of the deadliest cancers - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have discovered a new marker of one of America's deadliest cancers - opening up the opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-1f0a5f30-67cf-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - San Diego looked at mice who were genetically engineered to mimic the early stages of pancreatic cancer, which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14832361/oregon-man-symptoms-terminal-cancer-fatigue-weight-loss.html"&gt;kills nearly nine in 10 patients within five years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at cells under a microscope, they found cell stress and inflammation could be early warning signs of the disease as it can cause cancer cells to activate the protein STAT3, which has been shown to help tumors survive and resist treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;STAT3 then turns on the protein Integrin β3 (ITGB3) in mouse and human cells, which fuels the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes PDAC to spread faster and become more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation and cellular stress cause by chemotherapy also activated STAT3, increasing ITGB3 expression and further spreading the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the findings, researchers believe blocking STAT3 could stop tumors from forming while pancreatic cancer is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because most pancreatic cancers are only diagnosed after they have already spread, this could improve the overall survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Dwars of Iowa (left) and Holly Shawyer of North Carolina were both diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David Cherish, study author and pathologist at UC San Diego, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/pancreatic-cancer-early-warning-sign-screening-treatment-2102247"&gt;told Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Given the fact that STAT3 plays such an important role in many cancers and the fact that it controls so many genes prompted us to drill down on which genes in particular are associated with cancer development, progression and drug resistance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also noted the findings could lead to early treatments fo lung, breast and skin cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a857a910-67c9-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-a85dc390-67c9-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time it reaches stage four, the five-year survival rate is just three percent, making it virtually incurable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00781-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007818%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;, researchers genetically engineered mice to have a mutation in their KRAS gene, which raises the risk of lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was done to help mimic early pancreatic cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found in the presence of inflammatory proteins and stress induced by low oxygen levels - which makes cancer cells more invasive and treatment resistant - STAT3 activates ITGB3 in both mouse and human pancreas cells, which accelerates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This created a harmful loop between STAT3 and ITGB3, which caused tumors to become more aggressive and spread more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart shows survival rates for pancreatic cancer, per the National Cancer Institute &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, when researchers used cancer drugs to target STAT3 early, cancer development slowed and became less aggressive, keeping it from spreading to other organs and becoming more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In total, STAT3 induces the expression of 10 genes, including ITGB3, which form a gene signature the researchers dubbed 'STRESS UP.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes detecting the STRESS UP signal early can help predict whether precancerous cells will turn into pancreatic cancer and determine how aggressive a tumor may become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cheresh said: 'Having knowledge of this gene signature in patients could be valuable since there are known drugs on the market for other diseases that block STAT3 activation and thereby inhibit the expression of the STRESS UP genes in cancer cells.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted STRESS UP could be used to help develop early screening tools for pancreatic cancer, as there is currently no way to test for it until symptoms develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team now plans to explore molecules that could stop inflammation from activating ITGB3 not only in pancreatic cancer but also other forms of the disease that can affect the surface of tissues. These include lung, breast and skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s an offshoot of the XVD.1.5.1 strain, a descendant of the omicron variant. N.B.1.8.1 was responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in China earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e4162" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat,” as there have been anecdotal reports of some people getting painful sore throats, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

LP.8.1 currently accounts for 31% of all new cases, per the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c5fc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The new shots won’t be available until the fall, and are expected to be approved only for adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness. Healthy kids and adults who want a shot may have to find an older version or pay out of pocket. A single dose can cost &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;as much as $140&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44b44b" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say, however, that population immunity — whether from vaccination, prior infection or both — may shield much of the public for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-948229" class="body-graf"&gt;“While we don’t have a lot of high level of immunity in the population right now, because it’s been so long, we may have enough low level immunity to just make it a little bit harder for that virus to transmit easily from person to person,” said Andy Pekosz, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bb3ea" class="body-graf"&gt;Indeed, weekly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/covid-net/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalization rates&lt;/a&gt; have remained low, suggesting that the new variant may not be leading to severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed611c" class="body-graf"&gt;The number of cases are still drastically lower than those this time last year, when the test positivity rate &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_select_testpositivity_00" target="_blank"&gt;peaked in August &lt;/a&gt;at 17.9%. The 2025 season has yet to scrape 5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-161d4f" class="body-graf"&gt;Pekosz said it isn’t unusual for cases to rise during the summer time, when people are likely to crowd indoors to escape the heat. However, he believes that if there is a summer surge of cases, it will be a small one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4b288" class="body-graf"&gt;“The variants have been around for a while and haven’t caused any major surges up until date,” Pekosz said. “So again, I’m hopeful that if we see a surge, it’ll be a low level surge compared to previous years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7993af" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said people who are at high risk of severe illness still may want to consider getting a Covid shot, if they can find one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfc73" class="body-graf"&gt;High risk groups include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-cea065" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with weakened immune systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16672e" class="body-graf"&gt;Getting a shot is especially important, Levy said, for those who haven’t had one in over a year and whose immunity has likely waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-012f4d" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re in a high risk group and you’re in a state where cases are rising, you may want to just get the first available appointment and get a shot to protect yourself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ca792" class="body-graf"&gt;People at high risk can then consider getting an additional Covid shot when the updated vaccines are distributed in the fall, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ba9f53" class="body-heading"&gt;Covid has two waves a year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75b348" class="body-graf"&gt;Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said people in the high risk groups may also want to consider wearing a mask during indoor activities, such as the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f60a1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Healthy adults and children may be able to wait longer before getting another shot, Levy added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69cb06" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re in a lower risk group, that’s where things get fuzzy,” he said. “I mean if you want a vaccine and your health care provider concurs and you can get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6110ec" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Michael Phillips, an infectious disease doctor at NYU Langone, said that he sees mostly immunocompromised and older adults test positive for the virus. For those who haven’t gotten a Covid shot in years, Phillips said he doesn’t think they should worry just yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-601d61" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re younger, otherwise healthy, I think you’re OK,” Phillips said. “If you have underlying pulmonary disease, you know, if you’re an older age group, now that’s a time when you should be really talking to a doctor and saying, ‘Gosh, should I be getting a booster for Covid?’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2799a7" class="body-graf"&gt;He said that the amount of positive Covid tests NYU Langone has seen has decreased 40% since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c09b37" class="body-graf"&gt;Fatima Amaeka, a senior analyst at the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins, said she expects the current wave to peak around September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-557ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;Schaffner said to expect another wave in the late fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc0def" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“[Covid] has two increases each year,” he said. “Everyone is familiar with the winter increase that goes along with flu and RSV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:18:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNc0xPYV80N2ZYc1I2VFZCdkphNVBsTElCN2JrTWVwYzZLaWlmaGEwZWhESEFXS0ZvT0I2ZzB5cFpFSkdSbkRvLUpmMS1mWFE5aDVGSkxPMTVCNmVHX0ZqckQ1bjR3REl0X2NPVzk2OGdSQ1lEZThHU25VLVM1N1J0YmhoM0JtMzBDZkd5WjdtOTNGdGpKcGcwa29PRUxXR1dfejc1TlhLc2F2eGk0V2lLbExBVdIBVkFVX3lxTE9Vb1JMUTU0MVZqSy1FTVA0emxhM1R1dDVwRDF0UzZrY3M2ZTdkUlUtd21zSjY2dUVoNjR1cWdsVlQ5THlYbjNnWC1ydnY2ZEVkVk03ZHZn</guid></item><item><title>基因调整可以防止蚊子传播疟疾：山羊和苏打水- NPR | A genetic tweak could prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria : Goats and Soda - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPenVvY2FSaHU0NjFFLWw3ZzVweTJMOHdJelAzSnJuMTNacmk4bHUtR2dYT192UFBmU1B6OVdFQ1JqNEtWdkNxbldlUVc4ckMyWFRzUFZXTVZNM3ktQ0VUYmVkWTJNNTN4a3Jja2Z1NjJOX1NGYzdyU1lTaTdKOUhiNmhrdE5TU2RMUVlES3hLU0ZnWXdXc2NFUkU4SU55azJ1R1BBeXJ6RGw0Zmw4RkFrWDV4RVR0dDg2OEM2eTFGZGhjRk5udDIyVHRXVlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09283-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;highly resistant to spreading malaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal," says &lt;a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/entomology-and-plant-pathology/people/fgould/" target="_blank"&gt;Fred Gould&lt;/a&gt;, an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. "It's really exciting."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/11/05/451216596/powerful-gene-drive-can-quickly-change-an-entire-species" target="_blank"&gt;Gene drives&lt;/a&gt; are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1215/george-dimopoulos" target="_blank"&gt;George Dimopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What about consequences?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But gene drive technology is controversial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences," says &lt;a href="https://foe.org/team-members/dana-perls/" target="_blank"&gt;Dana Perls&lt;/a&gt;, senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, "the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/09/24/650501045/mosquitoes-genetically-modified-to-crash-species-that-spreads-malaria" target="_blank"&gt;suppress mosquito populations&lt;/a&gt; by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/07/20/1188631213/mosquitoes-spread-malaria-these-researchers-want-them-to-fight-it-instead" target="_blank"&gt;new genes&lt;/a&gt; that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called &lt;em&gt;FREP1&lt;/em&gt;. It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt; groups, one with the normal &lt;em&gt;FREP1&lt;/em&gt; gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that small change had big effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests "something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect," says &lt;a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/ebier" target="_blank"&gt;Ethan Bier&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. "I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really excellent work," says &lt;a href="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2154" target="_blank"&gt;Anthony James&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be "marginally more acceptable" to people wary of genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's good to have more than one approach available," he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(WSET) — &lt;/span&gt;A woman from Bedford County is recovering after a rabid fox attacked her while she was on her porch, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Virginia Department of Health, a fox tested positive for rabies on July 21 after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fox was killed when it attacked a woman while she was on her porch in the Thaxton area of Bedford County near the intersection of Pendleton Road and Quarterwood Road," VDH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VDH said anyone in the area who may have been exposed to a fox or any other animal in the area, whether by a bite, scratch or saliva, should go to the doctor and contact the Bedford County Health Department at 540-586-7952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/natural-bridge-zoo-giraffe-valentine-dies-during-attorney-generals-office-seizure-gretchen-mogensen-july-2025" target="_blank" title="https://wset.com/news/local/natural-bridge-zoo-giraffe-valentine-dies-during-attorney-generals-office-seizure-gretchen-mogensen-july-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Natural Bridge Zoo giraffe Valentine died during Attorney General's Office seizure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This incident is a reminder that rabies is present in Virginia and sometimes infects domestic animals like dogs and cats," VDH said. "Rabies is caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system and is lethal if proper medical care is not given following an exposure to the virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common way rabies is spread is through a bite, but it can also be transmitted by saliva from a rabid animal contacting open wounds, the mouth, eyes or nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some steps you can take to prevent rabies for you and your pets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure that your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with wild animals or stray animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals. Contact a licensed wildlife rehabber if you have concerns about sick or injured wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not try to trap or handle stray and wild animals. If a bat is found indoors and may have had contact with someone, do not release it. Call your local animal control officer or health department to determine if the animal should be picked up and tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report all bites to people to the local health department for investigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSET</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:40:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQWWt5eWxkQTJKd20xa0FBTE0xQ25wWHRBaldOV0M5OUhOOHlocXN3dWxhWmNYQkNBMnJ1WXRsWk0wckZiTmtOSTUzcW55ejdQOXNyQXRmT242Si1IRl9paDRwVXd0Um9DY2dOVHZYeUYxRThib0JaMHFWT3RrakNLdDFIblhBaFhmd3I0alNFWjkzM1psdUpfNzBHVTREUXlvRTRJNVV4eXNiRWhITGw0OUN2dC10RDQ3akxvSlNsY3dTc0FKUTVLdzZsSXNmSVhvRlRB</guid></item><item><title>尼安德特人的基因可以解释大脑从头骨中凸出的疾病- Live Science | Neanderthal genes may explain disorder where brain bulges out of the skull - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxPYVNvUmhMR241SWZvRHVGRWlkalRUVTdxdC1ISVcyQ0F0Z25OQ0xFTlV4azhHbUM0eHJsVEF4RFBrY0F4dEpqTm5SajVjN0ZEVXV4NWRJYnJRNTdoMnczRW5EZGs4ZEExSTA5aEowVG40VlE0cXJkY3RKVnVNMXNoWUhDVXVfb2taMnlSWVZaSng0anlqQk5NdmJuOGNCN1dBSVNsdXZhbEJkMVZPN2c3c3JydFpvT3kwcS1EaldzN0xjeDdlYkdBM2N3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

Symptoms may include headaches, neck pain and dizziness, and if too much of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bulges out, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mild cases, the symptoms may be treated with muscle relaxants, whereas in severe cases, doctors may treat the condition by removing chunks of bone from the braincase or vertebra, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/about/people/faculty/mcollard.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/about/people/faculty/mcollard.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Collard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleoanthropologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovered in the 1800s by Austrian pathologist Hans Chiari, the disorder is thought to affect about 1 in 1,000 people. However, recent imaging research suggests it may be significantly more common, potentially occurring in more than 1 in 100 people — it's just that most cases escape notice because they do not manifest major symptoms, Collard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 happens when the occipital bone at the back of a person's skull is not big enough to hold the brain properly, leading the bulging portion to become pinched.

The 2013 study suggested Neanderthal DNA might influence modern human skull development, leading to a mismatch between the size and shape of the brain and the skull — especially the base of the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this idea, the new study examined 3D &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CT scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the skulls of 103 living people — 46 with the disorder, and 57 without. The researchers compared these skulls with eight fossil skulls of close relatives of modern humans, including Neanderthals, &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; and prehistoric &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archaeology.upd.edu.ph/people/kimberly-plomp" target="_blank" data-url="https://archaeology.upd.edu.ph/people/kimberly-plomp" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kimberly Plomp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an osteologist at the University of the Philippines Diliman, and her colleagues found that the skulls of modern humans with the disorder were more similar in shape to Neanderthals than people without the malformation. All other fossil skulls were more similar to modern humans without the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study may mean we are one step closer to obtaining a clear understanding of the causal chain that gives rise to Chiari malformation type 1," said Collard, a co-author on the study. "In medicine, as in other sciences, clarifying causal chains is important. The clearer one can be about the chain of causation resulting in a medical condition, the more likely one is to be able to manage, or even resolve, the condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collard stressed these findings do not definitively prove a link between this disorder and Neanderthal genes. "Scientific research is rarely, if ever, conclusively based on a single study," he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work could analyze more skulls, especially fossil ones, Collard said. Researchers can also focus on collecting data from Africa. "What we know about the occurrence of Neanderthal DNA in the living human gene pool suggests that we should expect higher prevalence of Chiari malformation type 1 in Europe and Asia than in Africa," Collard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research does confirm a link between Neanderthal genes and this disorder, "then it might make sense to add screening for such genes to early childhood health assessments," Collard said. That way, individuals with a higher-than-average risk of developing Chiari malformation type 1 could be identified and then monitored and managed by health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists detailed their findings June 27 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/13/1/154/8175225" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/13/1/154/8175225" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives"&gt;Neanderthal quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about our closest relatives?&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;According to new research, communication between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-one-more-link-between-our-gut-and-our-brain-that-could-help-avoid-dementia"&gt;the gut and the brain&lt;/a&gt; is sophisticated enough to be classed as a new and distinct sense – one capable of affecting our appetite and even our mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This two-way link has previously been associated with a variety &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-intestinal-changes-result-traumatic-brain-injury"&gt;of health issues&lt;/a&gt;, though the physical processes at work have never been clearly identified&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on what we already know about our digestive and neurological systems, a team from Duke University in the US traced a series of biochemical actions from the digestive tracts of mice to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091941"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Diego Bohórquez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Yo-Yo Dieting May Trigger Long-Lasting Changes in Gut Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers looked closely at the protein flagellin, which is found in gut bacteria and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.167.4.1882"&gt;already known&lt;/a&gt; to trigger immune system responses. What the team wanted to see was if flagellin could also send direct messages to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By giving mice small doses of flagellin after fasting, the researchers identified mechanisms connecting gut bacteria and the brain via colon cells called neuropods and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;. These mice ate less than they normally would, with flagellin apparently acting as a type of messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that when the flagellin-sensitive receptors were turned off in mice, those animals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-happens-in-your-body-when-you-overeat-just-once"&gt;kept on eating&lt;/a&gt; – further evidence that this signaling operated the way the researchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168770" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits.jpg" alt="Eating habits chart" class="wp-image-168770 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168770" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flagellin affected the eating habits of mice. (Liu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has previously been established that the brain's response to cues in the gut &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-fat-junk-foods-might-be-messing-with-your-brain-s-appetite-control-study-finds"&gt;regulates our appetites&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argue the fact gut bacteria trigger communication that is responded to in real-time through a complex series of mechanisms qualifies the process as a novel sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies will be needed to confirm that this same sensing and signal processing is happening in humans, but there's a good chance that it is considering similarities between our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-bacteria-found-to-soak-up-toxic-forever-chemicals"&gt;digestive systems&lt;/a&gt; and those in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors are keen to expand their research to look at other types of bacteria-driven communication between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tweaking-our-gut-bacteria-could-help-protect-our-brain-from-strokes"&gt;the gut and the brain&lt;/a&gt; that might be working in the background, and to analyze how these signals might change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line – as with all research looking at how our guts and our brains are connected – the study may prove useful in understanding and treating eating disorders &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-there-are-two-types-of-obesity-and-one-is-worse-for-our-health"&gt;and obesity&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, we might be able to control this distinct sense in beneficial ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091941"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bohórquez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut. That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like obesity or psychiatric disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Tumours are normally slow–growing but can kill by compressing the brain and nerves if they grow too big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2,000 and 3,000 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with a meningioma and it’s more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest study, scientists at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, compared meningioma rates in 72,181 women on the jab with more than 247,000 women on oral contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, in the journal Expert Opinion on Drug Safety, showed the risks were more than trebled in long–term users of the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researcher Dr Mahyar Etminan said the dangers did not appear to increase the more years women spent on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added: ‘I do believe the evidence is now robust, with three large studies showing pretty much the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Women concerned about this risk may want to consider opting for alternative contraceptives.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is estimated  there are 10,000 prescriptions for the jab issued in England each month &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear why the jab triggers tumour growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One theory is the synthetic hormone it uses – progestogen – binds to meningioma cells and helps them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research suggests certain versions of the Pill made with progestogen can also heighten the risk of meningioma but only in a small proportion of women who take it for more than five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK drug safety watchdog—the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency—last October called on Pfizer to include a warning about the heightened risk in patient information leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer also wrote to NHS doctors urging them to immediately stop women from using Depo Provera if they were diagnosed with a meningioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia Buchanan, partner at Levin Papantonio—the law firm handling the case in the US—said: ‘This new study reinforces the need for legal action against Pfizer, with the hope of bringing justice for the women who have never been warned about the increased risk of developing a brain tumour from using Depo–Provera and who have gone on to develop meningiomas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the psychologist says some of the walking styles could be much subtler, especially among those with mild autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Research has also identified more subtle differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A study summarizing 30 years of research among autistic people reports that gait is characterized by walking more slowly, taking wider steps, spending longer in the 'stance' phase, when the foot leaves the ground [and] taking more time to complete each step.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Rinehart says research has shown that the autistic gait 'persists across the lifespan' and some walking styles can become more distinctive with age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe a different gait pattern could potentially be a 'game changer' for autism diagnosis, particularly in young children, because it can be observed early and objectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with severe autism, characterized by significant challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior, might have more pronounced gait differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If someone with autism is exhibiting an altered gait, Professor Rinehart says there is often no need for intervention unless it is interfering with someone's ability to participate in everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says if the walking style could increase the risk or frequency of falls then it is advisable to seek support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the gait is preventing someone from participating in the physical activities they enjoy, they could also benefit from intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therapy for autistic gait, particularly toe walking, often involves a variety of approaches including physical therapy and occupational therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical therapy focuses on improving muscle strength, flexibility, and range of motion, while occupational therapy helps with motor skills, balance, and coordination, often incorporating sensory integration techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other options may include serial casting, orthotics, or even surgical intervention in more severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it come to children, Professor Rinehart says that rehabilitation doesn't have to occur in a clinical setting and sports and dance classes have been shown to be beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'Given children spend a large portion of their time at school, programs that integrate opportunities for movement throughout the school day allow autistic children to develop motor skills outside of the clinic and alongside peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our community-based intervention studies show autistic children's movement abilities can improve after engaging in community-based interventions, such as sports or dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Community-based support models empower autistic children to have agency in how they move, rather than seeing different ways of moving as a problem to be fixed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, one in every 31 children aged eight or younger had autism in 2022 - a rate of 32.2 per 1,000. That's up from one in 36 in 2020, and one in 44 in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, early studies from the 1960s and 1970s estimated autism rates to be as low as 1 in 5,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-eaa52260-672f-11f0-9795-0749cc429f4c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report found wide geographic variation, with diagnosis rates ranging from roughly one in 100 in parts of south &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-c86f5cb0-1a2c-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to a striking one in 19 in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say the sharp rise in recent decades can be partially explained by improved screening, increased public awareness, and better access to services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some blame an ultra-processed diet, chemicals and pesticides for the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for an autism diagnoses is five, though the vast majority of parents notice odd quirks in their children, particularly around social skills, as early as two years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking ahead, Professor Rinehart says more research needs to be done to better understand the autistic gait. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will be particularly beneficial to children so that treatment plans can be tailored for their individual movement styles as they develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study in mice, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01380-1" target="_blank"&gt;published in Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, showed that an experimental mRNA vaccine boosted the tumor-fighting effects of a common cancer drug called immune checkpoint inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anticancer reaction," Dr. Duane Mitchell, a co-author of the study and professor of neurosurgery at the university's College of Medicine, said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRK/"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, developing &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/moderna-and-ibm-to-use-ai-quantum-computing-on-mrna-vaccines.html"&gt;personalized vaccines&lt;/a&gt; tailored to each patient's specific tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universal vaccine has the potential to be used broadly across cancer patients, "even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine," Mitchell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UF researchers are still working to replicate the findings in humans. If they do, a one-size-fits-all vaccine could provide an alternative to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells. Those cells often use PD-L1 to hide from immune attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by boosting PD-L1, the vaccine can actually make tumors more vulnerable to immune checkpoint inhibitors that block that protein, helping the immune system recognize and destroy the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed promising results on treatment-resistant tumors in skin cancers by combining the mRNA vaccine with a monoclonal antibody, a common immunotherapy drug that attempts to alert the immune system that a tumor is foreign and should be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also showed positive results when tested on mouse skin, bone and brain cancers as a solo treatment. In some cases, the tumors were eliminated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper describes a very unexpected and exciting observation: that even a vaccine not specific to any particular tumor or virus – so long as it is an mRNA vaccine – could lead to tumor-specific effects," said senior author Dr. Elias Sayour, a UF Health pediatric oncologist, in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Digital health earnings season is approaching, here's what to watch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're just days away from the peak of digital health earnings season, and this quarter is sure to be an interesting one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies that went public earlier this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health, will report results for the first time since their debut. And since President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending bill passed and his Aug. 1 tariff deadline is approaching, we'll get some insight into how digital health companies have been operating against a volatile macroeconomic and policy backdrop.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the reports CNBC will be watching for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 5 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digital physical therapy company Hinge Health will release its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 5, its first report since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in May. Shares of Hinge opened at $39.25 on May 22, and they're trading above $46 as of intraday trading on Wednesday. During its first quarter this year, Hinge &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/hinge-health-says-it-had-50percent-revenue-growth-over-last-year-in-first-quarter.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; revenue climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-10"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/OMDA/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omada Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 7 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual chronic care company Omada Health will report second-quarter results on Aug. 7, which will be the first time the company has disclosed financials since its June debut on the Nasdaq. Shares of Omada opened at $23 on June 6, and they're trading around $19 as of intraday trading on Wednesday. Omada's revenue increased 57% in its first quarter to $55 million from $35.1 million a year earlier, according to its prospectus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-11"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HIMS/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hims &amp;amp; Hers Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers Health reports second-quarter results on Aug. 4, and executives will likely face questions about its short-lived collaboration with &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-12"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In April, Novo Nordisk said it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/novo-nordisk-wegovy-telehealth.html"&gt;offer Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; through several telehealth companies, including Hims &amp;amp; Hers, to expand access to the blockbuster weight loss injection. But by the end of June, the deal collapsed over Hims &amp;amp; Hers' sale and promotion of cheaper knock-offs. Shares of Hims &amp;amp; Hers had soared more than 100% this year as of intraday trading on Wednesday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/DOCS/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doximity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; –  Aug. 7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doximity, a digital platform for medical professionals, was one of the few breakout stars of 2024 when the company's stock price more than doubled. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can sustain its momentum when it reports fiscal first quarter 2026 results on Aug. 7. Doximity shares are up more than 13% this year as of intraday trading on Wednesday.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-15"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/TDOC/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teladoc Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – July 29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teladoc Health CEO Chuck Divita has been working to turn the once high-flying virtual care company around after four straight quarters of revenue declines and an extended stock price slump. The company will release second-quarter results on July 29.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms can extend lifespan and reduce cellular aging by 50% in human cells and 30% in elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments reveal another potential therapeutic use of the compound—called psilocybin—which has already been studied as a treatment for a myriad of other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team from Emory University are calling it the first ever long-term study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice. The animals were the equivalent of 60 to 65 in biological human years, and exhibited hair loss and greying, as well as reduced physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were dosed with psilocin, the active ingredient in psilocybin that appears once the latter is broken down during digestion. The mice received a low level at first, and eventually with a higher dose of 15 milligrams once a month for 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first 3 months, the mice receiving psilocybin exhibited signs of youth, including fewer instances of greying and hair loss—including a reversal of these symptoms—and a general improvement in physical activity. By trial’s end, the mice that received psilocybin had a 30% increased lifespan on average than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, more than 150 clinical studies have been completed or are ongoing for examining psilocybin in the treatment of various clinical conditions, including anxiety, depression, addiction, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, chronic physical pain, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cite a study from 2020 which found that a single-dose of psilocybin can improve debilitating physical and psychological symptoms with improvements lasting up to and beyond 5 years post-dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Method behind the magic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This literature has firmly established that psilocybin acts strongly on a particular serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A, as well as several other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Notably, the 5-HT2A receptor is expressed in multiple organs and cell types, including fibroblasts, neurons, cardiomyocytes, endothelial, epithelial, macrophages, and T-cells, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are skin, brain, heart, and various immune cells in layman’s terms. In the brain, 5-HT2A stimulation was followed by the activation of one of the body’s most important determinants in aging, a pathway called SIRT1. This is heavily involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, a process by which cells that old become redundant, nondividing, and inflammatory, before eventually being cleared away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, we demonstrate that psilocin increased SIRT1 expression in cells, suggesting a potential mechanism by which psilocybin delays senescence and promotes longevity. This study provides the first experimental evidence suggesting that psilocybin may impact multiple hallmarks of aging, including delayed senescence, preservation of telomere length, [and] enhanced DNA stability,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote in their study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Partner Journal’s Aging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beyond its neurological and psychological benefits, our findings suggest that psilocybin influences systemic aging processes, potentially explaining its long-lasting therapeutic effects across multiple disease indications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also tested the effects of psilocin on human fibroblast cells from the lung &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, continually dosing them with the psychoactive compound or a placebo until they reached replicative senescence, or the point at which the cell has divided around 50 times and then stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psilocin treatment of 10 micrograms resulted in a 29% extension of cellular lifespan, characterized by delayed exhaustion of proliferative potential, increased cumulative population doublings, and decreased population doubling time. Strikingly, when increased to 100 micrograms, 29% lifespan extension became 57%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psilocin-dosed fibroblasts were also observed to have increased SIRT1 activity, and a preserved telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded their paper by describing psilocybin as a potentially “disruptive” pharmacological agent—an all-too-real suggestion considering the depth of therapeutic potential that has already been established in non-psychotic individuals using psilocybin for all manner of ailments, the reluctance of major pharmaceutical companies to explore psilocybin as a potential produce ingredient, and the sweeping illegality of psychedelic mushrooms in most of the world. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WaL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;There really is something to the concept of having a gut feeling. New research out today suggests our bodies can directly sense and communicate with the many bacteria lining our digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Duke University led the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. They found that nerve cells can respond in real time to bacterial signals from the gut—including signals that tell us to curb our appetite. The findings suggest the relationship we have with our microbial neighbors is even more complex than thought, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans are well known for having five basic senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). But according to the study researchers, growing evidence points to other senses that react specifically to cues from our digestive system, the “gut sense.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the researchers had previously discovered that certain cells lining the gut can sense specific stimuli and directly communicate with nearby nerve cells that lead back to the brain, called &lt;a class="qbe-widget qbe-widget" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat5236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;neuropods&lt;/a&gt;. And they reasoned that one type of stimuli these cells detect would be the gut microbiome, the trillions of normally harmless, often helpful bacteria and other microbes that live inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We had previously found that neuropod cells in the small intestine sense and rapidly respond to nutrients,” co-lead author Maya Kaelberer, a sensory neuro-gastroenterologist, told Gizmodo. “It seemed natural to think that neuropod cells of the colon could sense the gut microbiome; therefore, we set out to find out how.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team focused on an ancient protein found in the tail, or flagella, of many gut bacteria, aptly named flagellin. Gut bacteria appear to produce more flagellin when we eat, and neuropods can detect flagellin through a receptor called the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), the researchers found. In experiments with mice, they also showed that this interaction seems to be key to regulating our hunger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the researchers gave fasting mice flagellin directly through the colon, for instance, the mice ate less than usual. They then knocked out the TLR5 receptor in neuropods and ran the same experiment, finding that the mice now kept eating and gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that increased levels of bacterial flagellin act as a real-time signal for the brain to tamp down our hunger. Neuropods catch this signal through the TLR5 receptor and then quickly transmit it to the brain via the vagus nerve. If the neuropods’ ability to detect nutrients could be considered a sixth sense, then its detection of gut microbes might be a distinct, seventh sense, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We discovered that our colon has a sense for microbes, the neurobiotic sense,” Kaelberer said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More research is needed to confirm and better understand how this neurobiotic sense operates in people, of course. But assuming it’s genuine, the discovery would have important scientific and medical implications. Certain health conditions might alter the communication between gut bacteria, neuropods, and the brain, for instance, as might things like our diets or environment. And perhaps someday, we’ll be able to safely influence this sense to treat or prevent such conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you lived in a world where everything you saw was blue—blue walls, blue ground, blue computers, blue cars… Then you come home to see a yellow/orange peach on your blue table; it would have a profound effect on your experience. Knowing this, can we target this sense to have that same profound experience without the peach?” Kaelberer said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This is still just the beginning of the team’s exploratory work. They next hope to uncover whether neuropods can also detect immune-related signals. In the meanwhile, I’ll be sure to thank my gut bacteria from now on for helping me have at least some restraint when it’s time for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Four additional suspected cases are currently being tested. Rabies has not yet infected any people in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Gelman declared an ‘imminent public health threat,' which means the county can allocate more resources to disease mitigation and prevention efforts. The virus, public health officials believe, has migrated from New York City, where funding for rabies infection prevention in animals in the area has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies is estimated to cause 59,000 human deaths annually in over 150 countries, with most cases occurring in Africa and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-defa2f20-67cd-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-def9e100-67cd-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, this number is likely a gross underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human infections are rare in the US, with fewer than 10 cases reported annually, largely due to widespread animal vaccinations, effective public health measures, and the availability of post-exposure care that can save patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without prompt treatment, though, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13576711/rabies-warnings-attacks-multiple-states-rabid-racoons-bats.html"&gt;nearly 100 percent of patients&lt;/a&gt; infected with the virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There have been 25 cases of rabies in animals over the past 12 months. Four additional suspected cases are currently being tested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid infection, health officials advise against feeding or touching wild animals, stray cats, or dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, they recommend keeping pets up-to-date on rabies vaccinations and keeping puppies too young to receive the vaccine indoors, only allowing them outside if someone is supervising them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also told residents to spread the word about avoiding wild animals, especially those acting abnormally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a wild animal gets onto your property, they advise people to bring pets and young children inside until the animal is removed and contact an animal control expert to safely remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they said not to touch dead or dying animals. If they need to be moved, use a shovel to double-bag them and leave them in an outdoor garbage bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies can spread to humans or pets through bites, scratches, or contact with saliva from an infected animal, particularly when it comes into contact with open wounds, eyes, nose, or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is most commonly seen in raccoons, skunks, and foxes, but three feral cats that traveled from Queens in New York City to Long Island were found to harbor the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nassau County has had successful eradication of rabies since 2016, prior to this most recent outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The map shows which are most likely to carry rabies in various regions across the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilman said: ‘There may be more cases out in the wild — because we’ve confirmed 25, it’s indicative of wider spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘First of all, [there’s concern in] the sheer volume of cases that we have seen in one year, but also the rate of spread and also, the fact that it is feral domesticated animals.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The county will continue its rabies mitigation efforts through the fall, anticipating an increase in animal cases and concerns about potential human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When someone sees a cat in their backyard, it’s not necessarily as much of a reaction as seeing a wild animal,’ Gelman added, warning that children may also unknowingly play with a rabid cat.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department plans to use a rabies vaccine bait drop along the border with Queens and throughout the county. It involves distributing edible baits containing the rabies vaccine, often by air or vehicle, in residential areas where rabies is prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The time for prevention is now,’ Gelman said. ‘One ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That’s exactly what we’re trying to accomplish here.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 15:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我给了我的侄女一份慷慨的礼物。现在他们四分五裂，我得到了所有的指责- Slate杂志 | I Gave My Nieces a Generous Gift.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="14" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2nhq6001q95m65tfv7ocy@published"&gt;I made the mistake of buying a car for my nieces four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o606000a3b784ias1rsp@published"&gt;My sister is a single mom without much money, and my oldest niece, “Ava,” had just turned 16. Her sisters were 14 and 12. The idea was the girls would share the car as they got older, or my sister would sell it and split the money between them. She made an agreement with me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o620000b3b78w5yorz35@published"&gt;Instead, Ava took the car when she graduated and moved out of state with her boyfriend (with my sister’s blessings), leaving the other two girls dependent on the lackluster transportation system in their city. My middle niece just got accepted on scholarship to a college on the other side of the city, and it will take her hours every day to get there. My nieces constantly  complain and moan about not having a car, how it is unfair to them, and how Ava is my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o64g000c3b78nbkjtgn2@published"&gt;Worst of all, my sister does nothing to correct them. She even got offended when I told her that Ava should sell the car so they could at least afford two older cars! There is no way for me to afford to buy them all cars, but this falls on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o66s000d3b78tknk130q@published"&gt;A few weeks ago at dinner, I heard about the car again, so I told my nieces to drop the subject and said that if they wanted to blame anyone, they should blame their mom. I also said that if Ava was anyone’s favorite it was her.  My sister got very upset with me and we ended up having a loud fight. I left and have skipped family dinners since.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o69i000e3b78ud6mfabl@published"&gt;It is very frustrating for my generosity to blow up in my face like this. Our parents were not good people so it has always been my sister and me against the world. Even when her boyfriend abandoned her when she was pregnant with her youngest, I was right by her side. I never had kids of my own so I always focused on my sister’s kids. Right now, that feels like a mistake. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6ns000l3b780xvg9hmn@published"&gt;Everyone needs some time to cool off. You have every right to be frustrated—you were super generous with your nieces, and now that generosity is being thrown back at you. For that reason alone, I would take some time to process your anger before you approach this problem with your sister—and keep the kids out of the conversation. Sure, your sister might be stressed with the transportation logistics, but I’m not sure why the responsibility to solve that problem falls on you. Your sister might just need some time to reflect on the reality of the situation to see how unfair she’s being.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6pw000m3b78rn3qgof2@published"&gt;Be transparent about the fact that you all need some time to cool off. Something like, “I hope you know you’re all my favorite, I love you very much, but I’m really hurt by how this all shaped up, so I’m going to take some space to think about things and I hope we can talk through it later.” Right now, emotions are heavy, so it’s hard to stay calm—which is probably why you’re telling your nieces to blame their mom, which isn’t really helpful, either. Being upfront about needing some space lets your sister and nieces know you’re not the enemy. You’re still there for them, so they don’t have to spiral about what your intentions are and where you’re at with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6rx000n3b785kvmsic4@published"&gt;When you do feel ready to talk through things, that doesn’t mean you have to give into their demands. Give your sister a chance to air her grievances and listen to her, but tell her that ultimately, you simply can’t afford to buy her way out of this problem and you don’t want to talk about it further. She should communicate this to her kids instead of turning them against you. You’ve stated a pretty clear boundary already, so if she can’t stick to it, maybe you both need more time to let this go.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6u1000o3b78orpb2dzd@published"&gt;It sounds like you and your sister and nieces have a strong bond, and it would be a shame to let something like this break that bond. Tell her how much they mean to you, and that next time you want to do something generous, you’ll talk through it with her and set some firm ground rules for the gift. Family relationships are messy, but they’re also resilient. Give this one time to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2nhq6001v95m6oru8ums3@published"&gt;I have a stepbrother and half sister. They used to make an effort to include me in their lives and the lives of their children. But when our parents (my dad and step-mom) died a decade ago, that ended. Now, unless I hound them, I don’t get a phone call, let alone an invitation to Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcx000s3b781b7n1dx8@published"&gt;I might as well be invisible to their children unless the check doesn’t clear. I am not talking thank you notes. I am talking how my adult nieces and nephews don’t even have the time of day to text back when I tell them “happy birthday.” So when my I got my nephew’s engagement announcement in the mail, I didn’t bother to acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg363n200223b78gwerza5r@published"&gt;My half sister called me out of the blue and asked why I hadn’t reach out to her son or send a check as a gift. I was blunt and told her I hadn’t talk to her son in three years since he graduated college, and I was tired of our relationship being a one-way street. She claimed her son was just a busy young adult and said thank you notes were out of style. I told her gratitude and graciousness were timeless and it was tacky as all hell to demand money from people for personal events and not even acknowledge their gifts. I asked why she even bothered to call me. We hadn’t spoken to each other in months or seen each other in two years. She claimed I was being petty and our parents are rolling in their graves over my actions. I told her goodbye and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcx000w3b78svraqst1@published"&gt;I thought I was at peace with my choice to stop responding to them, but speaking to my sister left me with my hands shaking. I have no other family beyond my mother who has dementia and is in a care facility. She doesn’t know me half the time. I do have good friends, but they have their own lives and families. My health is good, but I know my time on earth is limited. A big part of me is afraid of what might come. Am I making a mistake here?&lt;/p&gt;

Even if that’s true, it doesn’t mean straight up asking people for money is okay. The point is, your half-sister doesn’t sound very kind, and using your parents as a bargaining tool to emotionally manipulate you is especially gross.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcy00113b789a6goill@published"&gt;If you never hear from your family except when they want cash, that’s not exactly the support system you want in your older years. I understand the concern about being alone, but accepting crumbs of attention only when your family needs something isn’t a real connection. It’s setting yourself up for continued hurt. The fact that your hands were shaking after that call is so telling about how this dynamic affects you. Your body is having a physical reaction to the emotional stress this is causing you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcy00123b78o2gmj2xn@published"&gt;If you really want to give it one more shot, you could reach out and say something like, “I’d like to have a real relationship with you, but I’m hurt that I only hear from the family when money’s involved.” But someone who calls you demanding gifts for events you weren’t even properly invited to, then tries to guilt you when you say no, probably isn’t going to suddenly become the caring family you deserve. You’re not being petty here. You’re being protective.&lt;/p&gt;

He is currently living in an assisted living facility across the country from my sister and me. He used to be very wealthy and has not worked for almost all of my life. My parents divorced when we were kids, and my dad was a verbally abusive parent, although he was loving, too. Later on, he became violent toward his girlfriend of 20 years, and she eventually left him. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/09/abusive-father-blew-fortune-cant-afford-care-money-advice.html"&gt;Now he has run out of money and can no longer afford the assisted living facility. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A patient in a South Carolina children's hospital has died of a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-swimmer-dies-after-infection-caused-by-brain-eating-amoeba/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to the facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a news briefing Tuesday, Prisma Health Children's Hospital-Midlands confirmed the patient died of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM, a rare but often fatal brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital did not share any more details about the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, the patient's exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, though officials said they cannot be completely certain. The department said this is the first known case in the state since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the briefing, Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the hospital, said these infections are "very devastating," with the vast majority of cases in the United States ending in death. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greater than 97% of cases that have occurred since the '60s have been fatal," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burch explained the infections occur when forceful water gets up the nose and is able to cross into the brain. This can happen during &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;recreational water activities&lt;/a&gt; in warm freshwater &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-swimmer-dies-after-infection-caused-by-brain-eating-amoeba/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rivers and hot springs, where the amoeba thrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce your risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests holding your nose or wearing a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into freshwater or keeping your head above water in hot springs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing contaminated water or from someone else who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first death caused by Naegleria fowleri in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-woman-dies-brain-eating-amoeba-tap-water-sinus-rinse/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;A Texas woman died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from an infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba after using tap water from her RV in a nasal irrigation device, health officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previously healthy 71-year-old developed severe symptoms, including fever, headache and altered mental status, within four days after the nasal irrigation rinse, the CDC case report said. Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, she developed seizures and died eight days after the symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't want an upturned, fairy cutesy nose,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted a subtle, straighter curve and for the tip to be parallel to the ground when I smiled.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She described the first few days after surgery as 'miserable,' explaining that she was in severe pain and struggled to eat, sleep, and breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said she immediately missed her old self, and fell into a 'deep depression ' in the weeks that followed. Her nose is seen before (left) and after (right) the surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy is now trying to warn others about the severe emotional impact of surgically changing your appearance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was so sleep deprived, bruised and swollen. My mouth was severely dry all the time,' she shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To purse your lips for a straw or to open wide for a bite hurt so much because the cuts that were still healing would tear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like paper cuts on your nose. I could only open my mouth a little. I had only soups and smoothies and tons and tons of water and tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would wake up in the middle of the night ... It was so uncomfortable because I couldn't move my nose or mouth very much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The first five days I constantly had blood and snot in my throat and had an incredibly dry throat all the time. It was absolutely disgusting. I do not recommend it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But harder than the physical pain was the emotional toll that it had on her, as she completely regretted going under the knife and longed for her old self back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started to unknowingly fall into a deep post op depression,' she shared. 'I cried for a week straight. I was so wildly sad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My loved ones would console me and call me beautiful over and over. I would just shake my head and fervently say, "Thank you but I don't believe you." I felt like I had ruined myself with all my heart. I felt so ugly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy, seen here with her new nose, said she feels 'incredibly guilty' for changing something that had been a piece of her her whole life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I still can't look at mirrors from a far away distance to this day,' she revealed. She's seen here with her new nose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the end, Wendy views it as a 'deep lesson on forgiveness and self love' and is trying to accept her new self. She's seen crying as she discussed her regret in an Instagram video&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she felt 'incredibly guilty' for changing something that had been a piece of her her whole life and 'deeply ashamed of herself for giving in to societal standards.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A nose job is an incredibly profound change to the physical, mental and emotional state of one's being,' she stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your brain will also reject your reflection and make it appear more warped than it might be so you can clear your face of foreign objects. I couldn't look at myself without shaking my head in regret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I still can't look at mirrors from a far away distance to this day.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She slammed her doctor for failing to go over the potential 'repercussions' with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He did not go over the repercussions of how I can react afterwards,' she said. 'He hadn't informed me about the possibility of post op depression.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the end, Wendy views it as a 'deep lesson on forgiveness and self love' and is trying to accept her new self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her message to others who may be thinking of going under the knife?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do not rush, do not make decisions while you aren't emotionally stable,' she urged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Talk to your loved ones about it. You don't have to feel alone. Surgeons will not advertise bad work. Don't rely only on social media for their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Scour the internet for their name and look for bad reviews.

The potential protective effect was more pronounced in males, individuals who were somewhat overweight, those with hypertension or hyperlipidemia, and non-Hispanic Whites. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.181"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine compound found in all living cells. It supports cellular growth, maintenance, and the removal of damaged components through a process called autophagy. It plays a key role in maintaining cellular health and has been linked in experimental studies to anti-aging and heart-protective effects. However, spermidine levels decline with age, which may contribute to age-related cellular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods rich in spermidine include aged cheese, soy products (especially natto), mushrooms, whole grains, legumes, green peas, and certain fruits such as grapefruit. Wheat germ and some fermented foods are also high in spermidine. The compound is available as a dietary supplement as well. Previous research has suggested that higher spermidine intake may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and enhance cognitive function, although human clinical trials remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yifan Ma and her colleagues sought to examine the relationship between dietary spermidine intake and cognitive performance in older adults. They analyzed data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2011 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHANES is a program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that uses a nationally representative sample to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. It combines interviews, physical exams, and dietary assessments to generate a rich dataset used in public health research and policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, the researchers included participants aged 60 and older who had completed cognitive function tests during the 2011–2014 survey cycles. The final sample included 2,674 participants, of whom 1,361 were women. Participants completed two 24-hour dietary recall interviews, during which they reported everything they had eaten or drunk in the previous 24 hours. They also completed a questionnaire about dietary supplement use. These responses were used to estimate each participant’s spermidine intake. Cognitive function was assessed using four standardized tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants in the highest quartile of spermidine intake (the top 25%) performed better on cognitive tests than those with lower intake. Further analyses revealed that the positive association between spermidine and cognitive performance was stronger in males, non-Hispanic Whites, individuals with a body mass index between 25 and 30, and those with high blood pressure or high blood lipid levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides evidence supporting the association between higher dietary SPD [spermidine] intake and improved cognitive performance in older adults. The protective effect was more pronounced in certain subgroups, particularly in males, non-Hispanic whites, and individuals with specific chronic conditions. These findings suggest that SPD may be a valuable component in dietary strategies aimed at improving cognitive health in older adults and populations with chronic diseases,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the health effects of spermidine intake. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results. While it is possible that spermidine has neuroprotective properties, it is also possible that older individuals with better cognitive functioning are better able to provide themselves with healthy diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.181"&gt;Association between dietary spermidine intake and cognitive performance in older adults: The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011–2014&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yifan Ma, Leyao Qi, Fangyi Zhu, Mengjie Xiao, Mengyao Li, Xu Zhang, Xiaodi Yuan, Yuan Wang, Changhao Sun, and Huanyu Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:02:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPYzVPRGNIeE1sanFtMXlWazBtN1AwVFNIUmtRY2luTzZIRnp1RkJwSnRIdWpsTWVXZ251emE1cXA2OEZtR2xRYWF2bGJTeFpMOWRZeUttalZmZ19JZ19nNFptMHlRd2FvVzlsNnQtSnpmLUdoWFNUNmRjNE05dUVuejlUbk5ZbmMySnRZWUlVMGNhRlVrOFItMTV6a2U4UQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家从世纪组织中解码1918年流感病毒基因组- SciTechDaily | Scientists Decode 1918 Flu Virus Genome From Century-Old Tissue - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOVHN1RVpTNEp4VFdnVy02TzJhTE1zYzBwalRRUTBfYjFOWkdjOUYzNk00bDFTSmVjVWF5ZXRac0h6bXNaLW5QNlpUb2NOZHVHUEhjN3gyR3ZubmlPb0s2VGF3SFd4MjN4Zk0xUm9jckVub3hoZ1FBNEVxQzhsalRjUm5ob3c0cERCWnRwOUxvV0swNG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 13:56:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOVHN1RVpTNEp4VFdnVy02TzJhTE1zYzBwalRRUTBfYjFOWkdjOUYzNk00bDFTSmVjVWF5ZXRac0h6bXNaLW5QNlpUb2NOZHVHUEhjN3gyR3ZubmlPb0s2VGF3SFd4MjN4Zk0xUm9jckVub3hoZ1FBNEVxQzhsalRjUm5ob3c0cERCWnRwOUxvV0swNG8</guid></item><item><title>诺克斯县确认前两例儿童拉克罗斯病毒病例- WBIR | Knox County confirms 1st two cases of La Crosse virus in kids - WBIR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAJBVV95cUxQbWZCeG9OaHdZZnBCVWp1UUhYSG42Um9iLUlRdHFDT1VmY2hNSVNXVEJuaUp4Q2ZlSGpTWkloT0wtMkhJVGUzeXBsNEtaLXdLdnc5cGYta1Zad3ZWNGxvcXJya1dJTld4VlpfN09WV0JVejhrUkFpQ29MRkh5M2ItNlBKNlY1aE81Q0J0WkI4enV6VUlGcm1WTGV0TmhWeXpoejRndVNUZ0NiZXd6MDI0RG1WUW5BMW1HUkVHTWtZWHFBNEVXell0SlJLME5EUEV6TXFpcVNSenRkenRrRmVDYVVxZTMxZ2hZYXpwaENGUVZJRUtaRWpPX1lodV9PTGlkMmNnaGJaLVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;According to a release, two children were hospitalized after contracting La Crosse virus, a disease spread by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KNOX COUNTY, Tenn. — Two children in Knox County were confirmed Wednesday as the first reported cases this year of a mosquito-borne virus, according to the Knox County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a release, two children were hospitalized after contracting La Crosse virus, a disease spread by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. The health department said both children are back home and recovering, but no additional information about their condition was available. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Crosse does not cause symptoms in most people. However, if symptoms do occur, they can include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, according to KCHD. The illness is spread specifically by the Aedes mosquito, which typically bites during dawn and dusk in heavily wooded areas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though some cases require hospitalization, the disease is rarely fatal. The majority of those infected recover with supportive care, the release said. In rare cases of severe infection, typically among children under 16 years old, the condition can lead to inflammation of the brain and neurological complications. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the best way to avoid La Crosse is to prevent mosquito bites. They recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants in wooded areas, removing standing water around your home, covering strollers with mosquito netting and using insect repellants containing DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice any new neurological issues (seizures, mental changes, drowsiness/trouble staying awake) in your child, seek emergency care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Four days later, painful blisters had formed around one of her fingers and she sought help at a Kaiser Permanente urgent care clinic, where medical staff swabbed the blisters. According to the lawsuit, the results came back positive for an infection – herpetic whitlow – which is caused by the genital herpes virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JI3AFVMP7NGXBHIH3IWAL5JRMM"&gt;The suit states that the woman didn’t have herpes before her manicure.

					&lt;p&gt;As you age, your workout routine should be adjusted accordingly to best suit your body’s needs. Over time, it’s common for the body to tighten up due to changes in both lifestyle and physiology. Similar to spotting fine lines, wrinkles, and gray hairs, you may also experience decreased strength and elasticity in your connective tissues and muscles, explains &lt;b&gt;David Kirschen, &lt;/b&gt;master flexologist for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.stretchlab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;StretchLab&lt;/a&gt; with 20+ years of personal training experience. To help address these changes, David shares one of his go-to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-moves-strong-flexible-at-60/" target="_blank"&gt;routi&lt;/a&gt;n&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-moves-strong-flexible-at-60/" target="_blank"&gt;es&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-training-exercises-to-build-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;building and maintaining strength&lt;/a&gt; in his 40s—with a key focus on the hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to our reliance on them for locomotion, our hips are usually one of the first areas to experience [the changes that occur with age], often resulting in symptoms like reduced range of motion and back pain,” David explains. “We also have a tendency to move less as we get older, causing an even faster loss of function.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;The hips are essential for weight bearing and locomotion, as they attach some of the strongest muscles in your body, including the hip flexors and glutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have been noticing back pain or difficulty getting around, the hips are probably your best bet to address first,” David tells us. “The following exercises will restore your range of motion, leaving you feeling less restricted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, David reveals his best hip-opening routine that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-moves-strong-flexible-at-60/" target="_blank"&gt;keeps him strong&lt;/a&gt;, mobile, and pain-free. Begin by performing these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/resistance-band-workout-week-results/" target="_blank"&gt;stretches&lt;/a&gt; every other day. Like any workout, stretching requires proper recovery time—especially when you’re just starting out. As time passes, you can do these exercises daily as long as you’re not sore between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Begin lying flat on your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop a yoga strap around your foot. (A belt or rope also works if you don’t have a yoga strap on hand.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your leg off the ground and use the strap to gently pull your leg toward your head, keeping your knee straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the stretch for a minimum of 30 seconds before switching sides.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your quadriceps (specifically the rectus femoris) is another leg muscle that can tighten your hips due to its origin at the pelvis,” says David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on one side of your body—the opposite side you aim to stretch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knee as much as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab your ankle with your same side hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull your heel toward your buttocks while allowing your thigh to drift back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to use a yoga strap by looping it around your ankle, then slinging the strap over your shoulder to bring your foot toward the buttocks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The piriformis is a tough little rotator in the back of your hip, deep below your glute,” David notes. “When it gets tight, it can cause discomfort by creating a rotational force at the pelvis. Additionally, an inflamed or tight piriformis can place pressure on the sciatic nerve, causing a radiating pain down you hip and leg.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your groin is home to your adductor muscles, which pull your legs toward each other,” David explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated with your knees bent and the soles of your feet pressed together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gently push your knees down toward the ground until you feel a solid stretch in your inner thigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the seated position is uncomfortable, this exercise can be completed lying down, flat on your back, with your legs in the same position as the seated version.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your hip flexors are located in the front of your hip, and pull your thighs up into a marching movement. When hip flexors are tight, they pull the front of the pelvis forward into anterior tilt, which is a dangerous condition for the lower back,” David tells us.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lower to one knee, with your opposite foot placed in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a tall torso as you press your hips forward until you feel a nice stretch at the front of your hip on the trailing leg side.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; My mother recently died of Alzheimer’s disease. Her mother had what used to be called “senility,” and Alzheimer’s killed my mother’s older sister and older brother before her. You can imagine my eagerness to do anything I can to keep from getting it myself. To that end, I have joined some clinical trials, and I read as extensively as a layman can. That led me to the People’s Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I decided to start taking l-lysine to keep the herpes virus under control. I know there’s little proof of efficacy against Alzheimer’s, but I also saw little downside. As Mom and I used to say, we’d swing a chicken over our head if we thought it would work! We were joking, of course, but if something is cheap and generally regarded as safe, I’m willing to be a guinea pig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m writing you today to see if you have an opinion on nicotinamide riboside. I’ve read that it might be of some use. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The research on this compound is intriguing, but most is preclinical so far as we can tell. That means that it has been conducted in tissue culture and animals (mostly mice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story so far: People with Alzheimer’s disease seem to have problems with mitochondria, the energy factories inside cells. They don’t function well and build up more oxidative stress. When brain cells are exposed to nicotinamide riboside, they appear to suffer less oxidative stress. As a result, in mice, this compound can improve cognition and alleviate inflammation in the brain (Neurobiology of Disease, Oct. 1, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the response in mice, scientists ran a controlled trial in 37 volunteers over 55 years old (Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia, Jan. 15, 2025). The participants took a set of cognitive exams, then took either 1 gram/day of nicotinamide riboside or placebo for eight weeks, took more cognitive tests and switched to the other compound for eight more weeks, ending the study with cognitive tests. The investigators did not report adverse effects from NR, but there was also no improvement in cognition. Consequently, this dietary supplement might belong in the same category as l-lysine — might not help, but probably won’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been told that eating beets or drinking beet juice daily will help reduce high blood pressure. Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It is true. Here’s the skinny: Beets provide dietary nitrate, which the body can use to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide helps blood vessels relax, lowering blood pressure. Other benefits include improved muscle performance, prompting some scientists to suggest that beet juice might help in treating blocked arteries in the legs known as peripheral artery disease (Nitric Oxide, June 2025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about beet juice and its effects in our “eGuide to Blood Pressure Solutions.” This online resource may be found under the Health eGuides tab at peoplespharmacy.com. It also includes information on other nondrug approaches as well as medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;A liquid bandage removed my skin tags easily and quickly. And none of them have returned. I told my dermatologist, and she was intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We have heard from other readers who have used this technique successfully. Skin tags are benign growths on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover that your skin tags return, you might want to check your blood sugar. Skin tags can be an early warning of diabetes (Cureus, Feb. 5, 2025).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On hot summer days, few things are more refreshing than a dip in the pool. But have you ever wondered if the pool is as clean as that crystal blue water appears?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://www.qu.edu/faculty-and-staff/lisa-cuchara/"&gt;immunologist and infectious disease specialist&lt;/a&gt;, I study how germs spread in public spaces and how to prevent the spread. I even teach a course called “The Infections of Leisure” where we explore the risks tied to recreational activities and discuss precautions, while also taking care not to turn students into germophobes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming, especially in public pools and water parks, comes with its own unique set of risks — from minor skin irritations to gastrointestinal infections. But swimming also has a plethora of physical, social and mental &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/swimming-gives-your-brain-a-boost-but-scientists-dont-know-yet-why-its-better-than-other-aerobic-activities-164297"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. With some knowledge and a little vigilance, you can enjoy the water without worrying about what might be lurking beneath the surface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The reality of pool germs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer news headlines and social media posts &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/swimming-pools-are-gross/"&gt;often spotlight the “ick-factor”&lt;/a&gt; of communal swimming spaces. These concerns do have some merit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that &lt;a href="https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/health-and-safety/how-chlorine-keeps-pools-safe-for-summertime-fun/"&gt;chlorine, which is widely used in pools&lt;/a&gt;, is effective at killing many pathogens. The not-so-good news is that chlorine does not work instantly – and it doesn’t kill everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/prevention/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; issues alerts about swimming-related outbreaks of illness caused by exposure to germs in public pools and water parks. A 2023 CDC report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7020a1.htm"&gt;tracked over 200 pool-associated outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 to 2019 across the U.S., affecting more than 3,600 people. These outbreaks included skin infections, respiratory issues, ear infections and gastrointestinal distress. Many of the outcomes from such infections are mild, but some can be serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Germs and disinfectants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in a pool that’s properly treated with chlorine, some pathogens can linger for minutes to days. One of the most common culprits is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2016.160"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;, a microscopic germ&lt;/a&gt; that causes watery diarrhea. This single-celled parasite has a tough outer shell that allows it to survive in chlorine-treated water for &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/infectious-diseases-keep-cryptosporidium-out-of-the-pool/"&gt;up to 10 days&lt;/a&gt;. It spreads when fecal matter — often from someone with diarrhea — enters the water and is swallowed by another swimmer. Even a tiny amount, invisible to the eye, can infect dozens of people. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common germ is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2012.020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterium&lt;/a&gt; that causes hot tub rash and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/swimmers-ear-doesnt-just-affect-swimmers-two-ear-doctors-explain-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-painful-condition-189213"&gt;swimmer’s ear&lt;/a&gt;. Viruses like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268806007370"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16020166"&gt;adenovirus&lt;/a&gt; can also linger in pool water and cause illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimmers introduce a range of bodily residues to the water, including sweat, urine, oils and skin cells. These substances, especially sweat and urine, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.07.012"&gt;interact with chlorine to form chemical byproducts&lt;/a&gt; called chloramines that may pose health risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These byproducts are responsible for that strong chlorine smell. A clean pool should actually lack a strong chlorine odor, as well as any other smells, of course. It is a common myth that a strong chlorine smell is a good sign of a clean pool. In fact, it may actually be a red flag that means the opposite – that the water is contaminated and should perhaps be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to play it safe at a public pool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pool-related risks can be reduced with simple precautions by both the pool staff and swimmers. And while most pool-related illnesses won’t kill you, no one wants to spend their vacation or a week of beautiful summer days in the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 10 tips can help you avoid germs at the pool: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shower before swimming. Rinsing off for at least one minute removes most dirt and oils on the body that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/prevention/preventing-diarrheal-illnesses.html"&gt;reduce chlorine’s effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid the pool if you’re sick, especially if you have diarrhea or an open wound. Germs can spread quickly in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2017.255"&gt;keep water out of your mouth&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the risk of ingesting germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t swim if you have diarrhea to help prevent the spread of germs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html"&gt;cryptosporidiosis&lt;/a&gt;, often called “crypto,” wait two weeks after diarrhea stops before returning to the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take frequent bathroom breaks. For children and adults alike, regular bathroom breaks help prevent accidents in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check diapers hourly and change them away from the pool to prevent fecal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming to &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-swimmer-s-ear"&gt;help prevent swimmer’s ear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t swim with an open wound – or at least make sure it’s completely covered with a waterproof bandage to protect both you and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shower after swimming to remove germs from your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

So she started taking &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/semaglutide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20406730" target="_blank"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;. For Shelby Meade, 55, an LA-based publicist, regular doses of estrogen helped temper her sometimes 30-day periods but did nothing for her perpetually bloated state. “I was heavier than I’d ever been and there was a constant pressure on my lower abdomen,” says Meade, who, like Kate, exercised regularly and had a healthy diet. A family doctor suggested Wegovy. “I just wanted to feel better in my body, and that flipped a switch,” says Meade. “It was a game changer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vasomotor symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats are recurring topics in conversations about &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/early-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, weight gain is just as pervasive: Around 60 percent of women gain weight during this transition, putting on an average of 1.5 pounds per year throughout their 40s and 50s. “I have 16 patients a day, and usually 16 out of 16 are reporting weight gain to me,” says Tara Iyer, MD, medical director of the Menopause and Midlife Clinic at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “Many had never struggled with weight but now have gained 15 or 20 pounds.” And that will happen to women without any changes in diet or exercise. “It’s a very unfair paradigm,” says Caroline Messer, MD, a New York City–based endocrinologist. Much of that midlife weight gain tends to be concentrated in the midsection, earning the unfortunate moniker “meno belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens due to a combination of factors. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22353-estrogen" target="_blank"&gt;Estrogen­&lt;/a&gt;—which, much like the collagen in our faces, we lose at a rapid rate come midlife—has many important functions related to weight and body composition: It helps women maintain muscle mass, and it contributes to the regulation of appetite and metabolism. “Essentially women are losing muscle, gaining fat tissue, and where we store our weight changes,” says Iyer. A drop in estrogen can lead to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it becomes more difficult for the body to regulate sugar, and for many women that glucose gets turned into fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing excess weight around the midsection isn’t just about vanity, it can pose a health risk: Associated metabolic complications can include fatty liver disease and hypertension, the latter of which, says Reena Bose, MD, an internal medicine and obesity medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic, increases almost 30 percent with even a 10-pound weight gain. The American Heart Association also highlights the menopause transition as a time of &lt;a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/the-menopause-transition-and-cardiovascular-disease-risk" target="_blank"&gt;heightened risk for women’s cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside aria-hidden="true" class="PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-TKIUW gbgCaK" data-testid="pullquote-embed-deemphasized"&gt;&lt;div class="PullQuoteEmbedContent-sc-lixSTo jszRRS"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormonal changes of menopause can make the weight gain more resistant to traditional diet and lifestyle adjustments, says Peminda Cabandugama, MD. But studies have found that GLP-1s can be a very effective reinforcement of diet and exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1s—that is, the class of drugs that includes semaglutide, packaged in brand-name form as &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-ozempic-hollywood-weight-loss-drug" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, like Mounjaro—“act on estrogen receptors in the body, and they improve insulin resistance,” explains Judi Chervenak, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist at Montefiore with a clinical focus on menopause. They also slow GI motility, so you feel full. That last part “can be essential because women are often simply hungrier during the menopause transition,” says Bose, adding that estrogen is also responsible for keeping the body’s hunger-balancing hormones, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17212793/" target="_blank"&gt;ghrelin and leptin&lt;/a&gt; (which tell us when we’re full), in check. The hormonal changes of menopause can make the weight gain more resistant to traditional diet and lifestyle adjustments, says Peminda Cabandu­gama, MD, an endocrinologist and obesity specialist at Cleveland Clinic. But studies, like a recent one in the journal &lt;em&gt;Obesity,&lt;/em&gt; found that GLP-1s can be a very effective reinforcement of diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is also growing about the potential benefits of combining GLP-1s with the menopausal &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/welcome-to-perimenopause-it-doesnt-have-to-be-hell" target="_blank"&gt;hormone treatment&lt;/a&gt; (MHT) that has long been recommended, and there are new companies to support the regimen. Alloy Women’s Health, an expansive digital menopause platform that connects board-certified physicians to women across the country (a boon in health care deserts), launched with estrogen creams and patches, but earlier this year they started offering GLP-1s as well. “Women really wanted it,” says Monica Molenaar, cofounder and co-CEO of Alloy. Now 35 percent of Alloy’s customers are on both a GLP-1 and hormonal treatment. Another platform, Noom, started as a digital weight-management platform and first offered semaglutide in 2023; it expanded into hormonal treatment this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These drugs are addressing different problems, but they work together in the sense that they both bring down inflammation,” says Karen Mann, MD, medical director at Noom. Messer is a huge proponent of coupling the treatments (she favors low doses of tirzepatide, which often has fewer side effects than semaglutide). A recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38446869/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Mayo Clinic found that overweight or obese postmenopausal women using hormonal treatments and semaglutide lost about 30 percent more weight than those using semaglutide alone. Chrisandra Shufelt, MD, an internal medicine doctor specializing in women’s health at the Mayo Clinic and one of the authors of the study, emphasizes that the findings don’t necessarily mean that hormone therapy supercharges the effects of semaglutide, but rather that hormones help the body respond more optimally to the drugs. (A larger study is expected to be published soon.) In lay terms, it makes sense: Hot flashes, night sweats, mood shifts, joint pain, and sleep disruptions—all of that can dramatically impact your quality of life and, in turn, lead to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are doctors, of course, who remain conservative about prescribing GLP-1s to women who don’t fit a specific set of criteria. “We have to be careful about using them willy-nilly, like with someone, for example, who has a normal BMI and may just not be happy because of a slight increase in body weight,” says Chervenak. “These drugs are not without risk.” There are the common side effects of GLP-1s, like gastrointestinal issues, abdominal pain, and nausea, and women should assess their risk factors with their doctor before starting any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE51dzFWSlJYN09fdU5PWkVzUU83T0dJUDNIbld2b2puVTU0N01FdVdUcGZPVmI2TnBoclVGRDRHdE1talBNdlBlemllX0RpRGpWYWg2clhIeTNwTlIyRlY2NzBtNjNUWWViWjZR</guid></item><item><title>药剂师说，这种副作用使大多数人放弃Ozempic和Mounjaro - bestlifeonline.com | Pharmacist Says This One Side Effect Makes the Most People Quit Ozempic and Mounjaro - bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5pSC1iUnNEUzBGTUNuQ0FhM3BwbXlWQTluN0lPM0dxR056Wm1fbldfZFg5ckV0ZU5PZXpuZXp3OW52cU80bVlZY01TNmlpMGZXNldrWVpVUHF6MFlTcVRHci1WUENSZmh5eUdJSHk3MU5hSkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content noskimwords"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Weight loss injections like &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-no-sex-drive/" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, Wegovy, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; have revolutionized the obesity fight, helping millions of Americans shed stubborn pounds, lower their blood sugar, and reduce their risk of chronic illness. But for many, the promise of dramatic weight loss comes with a steep price: tough side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Curran, MPharm&lt;/strong&gt;, a clinical pharmacist with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://optimalyou.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Optimal You&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, says there is one nasty side effect, in particular, that is causing some to quit the meds entirely. However, by knowing how to manage the symptom, you or someone you know can keep taking these weight loss drugs safely and effectively to reap their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/wegovy-headaches/" target="_blank"&gt;People Are Complaining About Ozempic and Wegovy’s “Life-Ruining” Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why patients stop taking weight loss drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The number one reason patients stop taking Wegovy or Mounjaro is gastrointestinal distress,” says Curran. “The nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation can be really intense, especially if a dose is increased too quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because these medications—known as &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tirzepatide-menopause-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; receptor agonists—mimic a hormone that helps regulate your appetite and blood sugar. But, they also slow digestion, which for some, leads to persistent nausea and other gastrointestinal (GI) issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as we’ve recently reported, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/semaglutide-er-visits/" target="_blank"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; found that 25,000 Americans may have landed in the emergency room due to weight-loss drug complications related to GI complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curran says one common explanation for this is because many new patients wish to rush through the titration schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patients often want to jump to the higher dose to see faster results—but that’s when the side effects really kick in,” he explains. “These drugs are meant to be introduced slowly. Ultimately, it’s not a race. The goal is to help the body adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond GI issues, Curran says other lesser-known side effects can also push people to give up early, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue and low energy (especially during the first few weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early satiety and bloating, even after small meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder issues, including gallstones due to rapid weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mood changes, such as &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/worst-foods-anxiety-depression/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; or irritability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hair thinning, likely from fast weight loss rather than the drug itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to minimize gastrointestinal issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are some “simple changes” that Curran and other medical experts say can help alleviate these disadvantages of taking weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eating smaller meals, staying &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tricks-to-stay-hydrated/" target="_blank"&gt;hydrated&lt;/a&gt;, and avoiding fatty foods can make a big difference,” Curran says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also urges staying in regular communication with your doctor when taking these meds. “Don’t suffer in silence. Small tweaks can be the difference between quitting and staying the course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no two bodies react the same, Paul notes that some patients tolerate Ozempic or Wegovy better than Mounjaro and vice versa, so it’s worth exploring both options under medical guidance. And if your symptoms persist, your doctor can determine if you need to lower your dosage or take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/medications-weight-gain/" target="_blank"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; are powerful, but they’re not magic,” Curran says. “The people who succeed are the ones who stick with the titration schedule, communicate with their doctor, and ride out the early bumps.”&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates that polycystic-ovary syndrome, or PCOS, affects anywhere from 6 to 13 percent of reproductive-age women. The syndrome is a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8316-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos"&gt;leading cause of infertility&lt;/a&gt; and is associated with the development of metabolic issues like type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease as well as a heightened risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10028221/"&gt;endometrial cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Recent studies have even linked PCOS to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/02/06/pcos-cognitive-health-explained/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; later in life, and diagnostic rates are &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2025.1569694/full"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37061077/"&gt;among younger women&lt;/a&gt;. While most experts think this is because there’s simply more awareness around the syndrome, researchers also believe genetics and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890623823001892"&gt;exposure to environmental pollutants — including microplastics, chemicals in pharmaceutical and personal-care products, and endocrine disruptors like pesticides&lt;/a&gt; — may contribute to the development of the condition. And yet, despite its pervasiveness, PCOS is still widely misunderstood, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/pcos-diagnosis-treatment-difficult-women-rcna142430"&gt;underresearched&lt;/a&gt;, and woefully underdiagnosed; the WHO estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of affected women worldwide may not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;

Once you do get a diagnosis, a doctor might put you on birth control, advise you to eat &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/well/eat/pcos-diet-weight-loss-calories.html"&gt;fewer carbs and sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and tell you to come back to their office when you want to conceive. But many patients, especially those who struggle to lose weight because of insulin resistance or who don’t tolerate hormonal birth control, just want ways to feel better in their day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyb5qv000v3b784oyomqyk@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;As people search for the answers to their individual symptoms, online scammers are trying to fill in the information gaps: Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz2p0999yo"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; tracked the most-viewed #PCOS videos on TikTok and Instagram and found that half spread false information. Managing the condition is hard enough without influencers peddling expensive, useless supplement regimens or offering pricey “hormone coaching” with no actual qualifications. We polled 120 women about their biggest struggles with the syndrome and took their questions to a panel of doctors. Here, what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

While being overweight is common with PCOS, about a quarter of respondents said they have lean PCOS, which means they have BMIs of 25 or below. “I have lean PCOS and have never been overweight as an adult, which led me to having a more difficult time getting diagnosed,” one said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li class="text-list-item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The cystic acne was severe — it was always close to my mouth and would cause my lips to swell, making it difficult to talk or eat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="text-list-item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Excessive body hair has tormented me, especially in high school. I tweezed my neck and chin for years before I could get laser hair removal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="text-list-item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The long-lasting periods. Sometimes they last more than 20 days in a row.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="text-list-item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Every time I go to a general practitioner for anything, they tell me to lose weight. I could starve myself and I still wouldn’t lose it. Doctors tell me to calorie count and exercise, but my body is working against me, and it’s demoralizing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

Each time I tell a new doctor I have PCOS, they ask me,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;‘Are you sure? There’s no way. You don’t look like it.’ The first time I heard this was from an ultrasound tech who said it to me while I was in a particularly vulnerable position — I was about to get a transvaginal ultrasound, which I was receiving as a result of my history of frequent ovarian cysts. I’d already been diagnosed, and it makes you feel like, &lt;em&gt;Even with an official diagnosis, you don’t believe me?&lt;/em&gt; The subtext is &lt;em&gt;It’s all in your head. &lt;/em&gt;The number of times my symptoms have been chalked up to poor stress management or anxiety makes me wish I never disclosed my mental-health history in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;

My PCP told me I just needed to lose weight and to relax so that I’d have less of an appetite. I told her I wasn’t really eating much and that nothing had changed with my diet. She was like,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;‘Sure, whatever you say.’ My OB/GYN gave me some asinine form that said, ‘If you eat five cookies a day for a year, this adds up to 15 pounds over time.’ I felt awful. I ended up relapsing in the eating disorder I’d had as a teenager. Three years later, I saw an endocrinologist who did a thorough workup and ended up officially diagnosing me. I felt validated.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyi40h00363b780i5c4gkj@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;“I’ve struggled with PCOS for 20 years and am now in perimenopause. The doctor who diagnosed me in 2006, when I was 21, really scared me. She said, ‘This is incredibly serious. You’re not going to be able to have children. It’s going to put you at high risk for all of these diseases.’ I felt a ton of shame. I really internalized what she said about not being able to have kids, or having an incredibly small chance, and believed her. We were still in the early days of the internet then, so I didn’t do major searches. In my 20s, I ended up deciding I wasn’t even going to try. I grieved the experience and moved on.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyimun003d3b78ikzef1d4@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resoundingly, you ranked GLP-1s like Ozempic and Mounjaro the most helpful.&lt;/strong&gt; “Ozempic means I don’t have to constantly restrict to stay healthy,” said one woman who told us the drug is the only thing that really helped her insulin resistance. “My periods are more regular. My energy is better. I have less ‘puffiness’ in my face and hands and improved mental health,” said another who uses off-label tirzepatide and wishes these medications were a “first-line treatment” for PCOS. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37762856/"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that semaglutides and tirzepatides can help PCOS patients who have struggled to lose weight achieve healthier BMIs, more regular periods, and a lower risk of &lt;a href="https://www.childrenscolorado.org/advances-answers/recent-articles/pcos-semaglutide-research/"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, though experts say we still need long-term data about the use of these medications for PCOS management.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyj62y003s3b786krx1dz2@published" data-word-count="90"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth control.&lt;/strong&gt; “Birth control helps me with symptom maintenance and getting a regular period,” one woman told us. Several others had the same experience and added that going off the Pill led to a resurgence of symptoms and complications, including a buildup of the uterine lining. “The most helpful advice I ever received was to stay on birth control. I came off the Pill for a few years to try and ‘manage my hormones naturally’ and wound up needing an endometrial ablation and a dilation and curettage,” one respondent said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyjgph003z3b78o80ybjqz@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diabetes drug metformin.&lt;/strong&gt; It improves insulin sensitivity and has been shown to decrease &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22778212/"&gt;levels of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10544455/"&gt;androgens&lt;/a&gt;, a group of sex hormones that includes testosterone and maintains reproductive health. Everyone has androgens, though men naturally make more of them. Women with PCOS often experience elevated androgen levels, which can lead to symptoms like cystic acne and unwanted facial hair. Survey respondents said spironolactone, an oral blood-pressure medication that acts as an androgen blocker and is prescribed off-label for hirsutism and hormonal acne, helped out with that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyjt1r00463b780kwretw2@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outside of medications, respondents said lifestyle changes like regular exercise, healthy eating, sleep, stress management, and acupuncture were also helpful. &lt;/strong&gt;But, of course, getting an endocrine consult is key to figuring out a good treatment plan. “Testing my hormones has unlocked everything — I can’t believe it took four years of being diagnosed to get someone to start regularly checking my bloodwork to see what the key drivers were,” one woman said.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of you were also frustrated by being told you wouldn’t have to worry about your PCOS until you were actively trying to get pregnant. Here, the worst advice you received:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li class="text-list-item"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A derm tried to sell me an expensive hair-loss procedure but could care less about the root cause.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

These were the main questions you had about PCOS, so we asked a panel of doctors about them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyvhd2005t3b78r6l0htc8@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it so hard to get a diagnosis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On average, women with PCOS will end up seeing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5413168/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20that%20more,to%20English%2Dspeaking%20women)."&gt;three different providers&lt;/a&gt; before getting diagnosed because the condition is so hard to identify and other hormonal disorders have to be ruled out first. “PCOS can present differently in different individuals,” says Jessica Chan, a reproductive endocrinologist at Cedars-Sinai. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all diagnosis. Even among scientific experts in the field, physicians, scientists, there’s no consensus as to what the diagnostic criteria are.” She recommends finding a board-certified OB/GYN or a reproductive endocrinologist, specialists who “should be trained in PCOS care.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeysswi005m3b780819817f@published" data-word-count="207"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is birth control usually the go-to treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We heard from many people who felt as though their doctors just put them on birth control and left it at that. Those patients worried that the medication simply masked their symptoms. But birth control &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;treat symptoms by decreasing your production of androgens and improving symptoms like excess hair growth and acne, according to Dr. Chan. “A lot of people get a diagnosis after they come off the birth-control pill, but that’s probably because the Pill did a good job of treating a lot of the symptoms,” she says. Birth control also helps regulate your period, which is important because if you aren’t regularly menstruating, your uterine lining can build up and possibly lead to uterine cancer, one of the conditions associated with PCOS. “The birth-control pill is nice in the sense that it can bring on that period, and it can provide some hormonal protection of the uterus,” says Dr. Chan. That said, not everyone responds well to the Pill, which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/3977-birth-control-the-pill"&gt;can cause&lt;/a&gt; nausea, mood swings, and decreased libido in some patients. If you’re on the fence about birth control, consider seeing an endocrinologist, who will have a better understanding of which pill may be right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdezri24000z3b78axx7wqxl@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to see a PCOS nutritionist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around 75 percent of women with PCOS struggle with insulin resistance, which can make it &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/whats-the-best-diet-for-insulin-resistance.h00-159774078.html"&gt;easier to gain weight&lt;/a&gt; and harder to lose it. After years of telling women with PCOS who are overweight or obese that they should reduce their caloric intake by 750 calories a day, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/well/eat/pcos-diet-weight-loss-calories.html"&gt;International PCOS Network&lt;/a&gt; recently came out and said there’s no evidence to suggest that restrictive diets had any effect on symptoms in the long term. The organization now says that, instead of restricting calories, patients should focus on achieving an “overall balanced and healthy dietary composition.”&lt;/p&gt;

No one diet fits every PCOS patient, but generally a low-glycemic-index diet that’s rich in whole foods, fiber, protein, and healthy fats, like the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/pcos-diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, can help stabilize blood sugar and improve symptoms of PCOS, says Pardis Hosseinzadeh, an OB/GYN, infertility specialist, and reproductive endocrinologist at Johns Hopkins Fertility Center. Instead of eating highly processed carbs that spike your blood sugar, like white bread, focus on complex carbs such as potatoes, legumes, and whole grains, which take longer for your body to digest and maintain steady blood-sugar levels. “The PCOS diet is very similar to the type 2 diabetes diet, which is essentially low carb, not no carb,” says Lynsey Johnson, a doctor of nursing practice at the telehealth clinic &lt;a href="https://pcossisters.com/"&gt;PCOS Sisters&lt;/a&gt;. “Keto” — a high-fat, extremely low-carb diet that encourages the body to burn fat for fuel rather than carbs — “is very bad for PCOS because when you reintroduce a healthy diet, you get rebound weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re not sure where to start looking for a nutritionist, ask your doctor if they can refer you to someone, or check out the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/find-a-nutrition-expert"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt; database to find a credentialed provider near you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyw9bc006b3b78zub06css@published" data-word-count="167"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are rates of PCOS really rising?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/-/media/endocrine/files/patient-engagement/hormones-and-series/hormones_and_polycystic_ovary_syndrome_what_you_need_to_know.pdf"&gt;5 million to 6 million women&lt;/a&gt; in the United States have PCOS. Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1514250/full"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of the disorder rose from around 35 million in 1990 to nearly 66 million in 2021. Within the U.S., diagnoses &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37061077/"&gt;have increased&lt;/a&gt; among patients between the ages of 16 and 20; some experts think rising &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0912-adult-obesity.html"&gt;obesity rates&lt;/a&gt; may be a factor in that trend. “Obesity itself can worsen PCOS symptoms, therefore making the diagnosis more common,” says Dr. Chan. Experts aren’t sure if the syndrome is becoming more widespread or if it’s simply being &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37061077/"&gt;diagnosed more as patients learn more about it. &lt;/a&gt;“There’s a lot of different numbers out there, but we don’t know if it’s actually rising biologically,” says Dr. Chan. “People are becoming more aware and are more likely to see their doctor.” And patients aren’t the only ones with more awareness. Primary-care providers and OB/GYNs also have more understanding about PCOS, says Dr. Hosseinzadeh, as well as more clearly established diagnostic criteria and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyw9bc006c3b78g4tcxgga@published" data-word-count="144"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does having PCOS mean I’ll struggle with fertility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the irregular periods that are a hallmark of PCOS &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;can make it harder to get pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, having the syndrome doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/opinion/pcos-diagnosis-internet-pregnancy.html"&gt;fertility problems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31504532/"&gt;Studies show &lt;/a&gt;that women with PCOS are just as likely as their counterparts without it to get pregnant, even if it might take longer. In other words, don’t panic. “There are a lot of great medications to help women with PCOS ovulate with regularity, and if we’re able to get women with PCOS to ovulate regularly, then their fertility should be the same as their same-age counterparts,” says Dr. Chan. If you have PCOS, experience irregular periods, and want to start a family, she recommends seeing a fertility specialist “on the earlier side” so you can get evaluated and treated as soon as possible: “It’s not something to sit on.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyw9bd006d3b78r73htw0c@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;Many times, the treatment is straightforward. Dr. Hosseinzadeh prescribes oral medications like Clomid or letrozole, which can help induce ovulation without further fertility treatments like IUI or IVF. “Having PCOS does not equal having infertility,” she stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyw9bd006e3b7880dubgrs@published" data-word-count="176"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is lean PCOS, and is it harder to diagnose? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lean-PCOS patients have BMIs of 25 or under and account for roughly &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/unique-challenges-of-lean-women-with-pcos-4155138"&gt;one-third of PCOS cases&lt;/a&gt;. Studies describing this patient population have been around since the ’90s, though the diagnosis became more popular in the aughts, according to Dr. Chan. Lean-PCOS patients can still have insulin resistance, higher androgen levels, and an increased risk of diabetes. However, the fact that they aren’t overweight — a more classic PCOS symptom — means they often receive delayed diagnoses and sometimes don’t find out they have the condition until they run into issues &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/unique-challenges-of-lean-women-with-pcos-4155138"&gt;conceiving.&lt;/a&gt; “A lot of patients come to me after having been seen by other clinicians, and they were told they couldn’t have PCOS because they were at a normal weight, which is incorrect — weight is not one of the diagnostic criteria,” says Dr. Chan. “The symptoms tend to be worse in women who are overweight, but being lean absolutely doesn’t exclude the diagnosis,” says Dr. Elise Brett, an endocrinologist who runs a private clinic in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeywnoy006r3b789pe06zfz@published" data-word-count="31"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you suspect you’re experiencing symptoms of PCOS, it can be overwhelming to figure out how — and where — to get the proper treatment. Here, a road map to help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeywwwg006y3b7854ljvqjr@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start with your primary-care doctor or OB/GYN. &lt;/strong&gt;Get specific about your symptoms, and ask your doctor why you’re experiencing them — don’t take “It’s normal”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for an answer. “A lot of patients might just tell their gynecologist that they have irregular periods and then get put on the Pill without diving into &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;they have irregular periods,” says Dr. Brett. Don’t be shy about the symptoms you most want help with: “Are you having facial hair, acne, or hair loss? Those are not necessarily things that every woman is going to come forward about, but they’re things that can get worse over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyx48v00753b78z3lfu98b@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ask your doctor for testing to rule out other conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;Blood tests to measure hormone levels and glucose-tolerance tests to see how your body responds to sugar can rule out other conditions that PCOS resembles: Cushing’s, pituitary and thyroid conditions, excess steroid production, enzyme deficiencies, and hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition where the brain tells your period to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyx48w00763b78dhw3mpdf@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. If all else fails, ask for a referral to an endocrinologist. &lt;/strong&gt;Hitting a roadblock? If your PCP or gynecologist is reluctant to do tests, or just doesn’t seem particularly knowledgeable about the syndrome, ask for an endocrine consult. “Some gynecologists will be very proactive about the evaluation; some won’t,” says Dr. Brett. “Ask for an endocrinologist — this is their bread and butter.” Even if you have a good doctor who’s knowledgeable about PCOS, Dr. Chan recommends getting an endocrine consult anyway: “It’s what I do to make sure that diagnosis is correct.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyx48w00773b78ciz3oo3v@published" data-word-count="141"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. If you get a birth-control prescription, push for one that’s right for you. &lt;/strong&gt;If you have negative side effects, ask your endocrinologist to prescribe you another pill. Keep in mind that “there are many, many different birth-control-pill options” out there, according to Dr. Brett. There are also treatment options other than birth control that can help with menstrual irregularity and protect the uterine lining. For instance, if you can’t or don’t want to be on a pill with estrogen, you can ask about progesterone-secreting IUDs or about taking cyclic progesterone — which involves taking the hormone during certain phases of the menstrual cycle to induce regular bleeding — if you don’t have a period at least once every three months. For symptoms like acne, ask about spironolactone, or Winlevi, a prescription acne cream that helps acne caused by excess androgens.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdeyx48x00783b78caboqtzy@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Stick to providers with actual qualifications.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no shortage of TikTok “hormone coaches” peddling expensive &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz2p0999yo"&gt;diet and supplement programs&lt;/a&gt; that claim to help you naturally reverse your PCOS. Save your money. “There’s nothing that a specific ‘coach’ can help teach you,” says Dr. Brett. If you’re working with a registered dietitian or fitness coach on lifestyle modifications, that’s fine. Otherwise, if someone isn’t a licensed health-care provider, preferably with special training in endocrinology and, particularly, reproductive endocrinology, steer clear.&lt;/p&gt;

(WKRC) — An outbreak of Giardia has begun to migrate across Kentucky, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1131293932362885&amp;amp;set=pcb.1131295782362700" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1131293932362885&amp;amp;set=pcb.1131295782362700" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;A statement issued by Kentucky Public Health Monday states&lt;/a&gt; that officials are investigating a Giardia outbreak in Western Kentucky, with Hopkins County being the primary area affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of July 21, 2025, there have been 66 laboratory-confirmed cases of Giardia reported across Hopkins, Muhlenberg and Webster Counties since May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact sources of the infection remain unidentified, numerous cases have been linked to dining at El Tapatio Mexican Cantina in Madisonville, Kentucky. The restaurant has been cooperating fully with health officials as the investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are conducting environmental sampling to pinpoint potential sources of Giardia exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giardia is a parasite commonly found in untreated waters, such as streams, rivers, and lakes, and can spread through contaminated water, food, or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of Giardia typically appear one to three weeks after exposure and can include diarrhea, gas, stomach pain and fatigue. These symptoms can last for weeks. Young children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for complications, including dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends prompt diagnosis, maintaining good hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting home environments and child care facilities and monitoring water quality in private wells to prevent and control Giardia outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kentucky, approximately 100 to 300 cases of Giardia are reported annually, with a higher frequency during summer and early fall. The parasite is often linked to recreational water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and swimming pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials advise those concerned about potential Giardia infection to consult their healthcare provider for testing or treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 10:27:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>救命！我儿子刚刚放弃了捐精的消息。这给了我一个绝妙的想法。- Slate杂志 | Help!

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9lf9ts00073b77nppammj6@published"&gt;He’s not married and has expressed no interest in having children, so this came as a complete shock. My son is an only child, and I have been lamenting the prospect of never having grandchildren. Would it be acceptable if I approached this couple to ask if I can be in my granddaughter’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

They might agree. And if they do, this could work out really well. Almost all parents would benefit from having more loving adults in their lives who are willing to be there for their children. But if the three of you do decide you’ll be a part of the kid’s life, you should work hard to clarify expectations about your role. You should be very careful not to suggest that you have some kind of authority over the child because of your biological connection. There are other things to iron out, too: What will you be called? How much do they think they might be in touch with you? Are they open to advice on feeding, sleep, and milestones? Are you going to be visiting when it works for you and enjoying the fun parts of caring for a baby, or showing up as needed and helping out with the hard parts?&lt;/p&gt;

Be prepared for the answer to be, “No thanks.” If that’s the case, knowing that there is a child out there who is part of your bloodline and whom you don’t know could be painful, especially because you’d really like to have a grandchild. So have a plan for how you’ll manage those feelings, to best take care of yourself, but also to avoid behaving in a way that causes a rift with your son.&lt;/p&gt;

Check out one of the groups dedicated to connecting families without local grandparents to people who would like to fill that role (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SurrogateGrandparentsNorthAmerica/"&gt;here’s one&lt;/a&gt;). Or volunteer with children. Don’t let your son’s choice not to have kids keep you from sharing the nurturing energy you have to give. You could find a really fulfilling relationship with a child who makes you forget that you’re not biologically related.&lt;/p&gt;

Think about whether working to deepen your relationship with him might be comforting in some way. I’m sure that when you were raising him, you were often prioritizing the tasks you needed to complete to get through the day. In this era, you can slow down and really enjoy him and his adult personality. I’m struck by the fact that he didn’t tell you about donating sperm until after the birth. That makes me think there’s room for you to express more curiosity about his life, show that you’re a supportive person to talk to, and even have some fun together. While hanging out with an adult son is not going to scratch the same itch as cuddling an adorable baby, it might provide some joy that you didn’t know you were &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 29-year-old woman in Lithuania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The woman had been trying to conceive with her male partner but had not become pregnant. Two rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) also failed to produce a pregnancy, but gynecological exams did not find any underlying causes for why she was unable to become pregnant. (When the patient's doctors described the case &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11390391/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11390391/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they did not mention if any fertility tests were also conducted on her partner.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the woman had a history of asthma and sensitivity to inhaled allergens, such as mold, cat fur and dust. So she visited a medical facility to see if her allergies might be affecting her fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; At the facility, blood tests revealed that the woman had unusually high amounts of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of white blood cell that defends the body against allergens. Skin tests showed that, in addition to the woman's known allergy triggers, she was sensitive to mites, pollen from weeds and grasses, and allergens from insects and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was especially sensitive to a protein called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/phadia/us/en/resources/allergen-encyclopedia/e5/e226.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thermofisher.com/phadia/us/en/resources/allergen-encyclopedia/e5/e226.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canis familiaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; allergen 5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Can f 5), which is found in dog dander and urine. Sensitivity to Can f 5 can also indicate sensitivity to similar types of proteins found in human semen, the doctors wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with an allergist at the facility, the patient confirmed that she experienced nasal congestion and sneezing after unprotected intercourse with her male partner. These symptoms were previously overlooked by other specialists during consultations about her inability to conceive, she reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors then conducted further allergy tests using samples of semen collected from the woman's partner. The patient's allergic response confirmed the doctors' suspicions that she had a human seminal plasma allergy. (Seminal plasma is the fluid component of semen that carries the sperm cells.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h3jkkoSZuhCmTTWT7qiCGi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h3jkkoSZuhCmTTWT7qiCGi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity to semen "is a potential cause of female infertility," because such allergies can trigger inflammation in reproductive organs, according to the report. It's not immediately clear if the allergy somehow complicated the woman's IVF treatments, as well, given semen would not have been present in the implanted embryos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Barrier contraception — namely, condom use — is the most common intervention for a semen allergy. However, the patient was still eager to conceive with her partner, so she rejected that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only known treatment for reducing sensitivity to semen involves introducing the fluid into the patient's body in gradually increasing concentrations, to build up their tolerance to the allergens. But this course of treatment was unavailable in Lithuania, the doctors wrote. Instead, they recommended that the woman take antihistamine medication before intercourse to reduce the severity of her allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She followed their instructions but found this approach "ineffective," the doctors wrote. During a follow-up visit three years later, the woman said that she had still been unable to conceive. What's more, new allergic symptoms now appeared after contact with her partner's semen, including a burning sensation in her vulva, puffy eyelids and watery eyes. No further treatments were recommended, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Worldwide, medical experts have documented about &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15196267/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15196267/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;80 cases of human seminal plasma allergy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and there is still much to be learned about its impact on pregnancy, especially in the presence of other health-related issues that could hinder conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of infertility are often difficult to pinpoint. Therefore, "this case serves as a reminder that seemingly unrelated allergic conditions, when combined, can contribute to reproductive health challenges, warranting comprehensive evaluations," the woman's doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-h3jkkoSZuhCmTTWT7qiCGi-5fCUT38Ux92FKZ6IzgSVzy4h7C0gpkHE" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-h3jkkoSZuhCmTTWT7qiCGi-5fCUT38Ux92FKZ6IzgSVzy4h7C0gpkHE slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Stay mentally active&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain needs exercise just like the body does. To keep your mind busy, you could read, do puzzles, learn a new skill, or play memory games. Learning new things throughout your life keeps your brain active and may slow down cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Physical activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise gets more blood to the brain and helps it make new cells. Older people can improve their memory, focus, and overall brain health by doing activities like walking, yoga, or swimming for 150 minutes a week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/03/16/550x309/pexels-vlada-karpovich-8939923_1678958102965_1678958126445_1678958126445.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Physical activity can prevent brain decline in older adults.(Photo by Vlada Karpovich on Pexels)" title="Physical activity can prevent brain decline in older adults.(Photo by Vlada Karpovich on Pexels)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Physical activity can prevent brain decline in older adults.(Photo by Vlada Karpovich on Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Eat a brain-healthy diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a Mediterranean style diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and healthy fats is good for your brain, slows down aging, and may lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other memory problems in older adults. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/worried-about-cognitive-decline-with-age-wellness-coach-shares-5-daily-habits-to-keep-your-brain-healthy-101750768962080.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Worried about cognitive decline with age?

Stay socially connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being alone and sad can make your brain worse. Being around other people often, like with family, friends, or community groups, keeps your mind busy and your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Prioritise sleep and manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory and decision-making can suffer from not getting enough sleep and being under constant stress. Try to get 7 to 8 hours of good sleep each night. Do things that help you relax, like meditation, deep breathing, or spending time in nature. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/world-brain-day-neurologist-shares-10-brain-boosting-foods-to-improve-cognitive-strength-101752757536449.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="World Brain Day: Neurologist shares 10 brain-boosting foods to improve cognitive strength"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Brain Day: Neurologist shares 10 brain-boosting foods to improve cognitive strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal study of nearly 996 healthy adults found that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated ageing of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting paper, "Accelerated brain ageing during the COVID-19 pandemic," &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal Nature Communications on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper explains that the UK's Biobank contains longitudinal neuroimaging data describing the brains of over 15,000 Brits, and that scientists have used machine learning and those records to create a brain age prediction model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plausible explanation is chronic stress, social isolation, economic insecurity, and health concerns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Nottingham researchers who led the study captured MRI images of 996 people who lived through COVID, applied the model, and estimated each person's "brain age" — how old their brain appeared to be compared to their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found "the pandemic significantly accelerates brain ageing" by an average of 5.5 months. Even those who didn't catch the virus endured the same outcome. The researchers found more pronounced ageing in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

    

&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't sure why subjects' brains aged so fast during the pandemic but suggest "A plausible explanation … is chronic stress, potentially linked to pandemic-related factors such as social isolation, economic insecurity, and health concerns." The paper also notes previous studies that found social isolation and perceived loneliness change the brain in ways felt to drive accelerated brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

        


        

&lt;p&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," said Dorothee Auer, Professor of Neuroimaging and senior author on the study. "The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage. We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While brains appear to have aged more quickly during the pandemic, the study found only participants who were infected by COVID-19 between their brain scans showed a drop in certain cognitive abilities, such as mental flexibility and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that the pandemic’s brain ageing effect, on its own (without infection) may not cause symptoms," states the University of Nottingham's summary of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the need to address health and socio-economic inequalities in addition to lifestyle factors to mitigate accelerated brain ageing," the paper concludes.
