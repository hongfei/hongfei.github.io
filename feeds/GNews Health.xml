Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-study-found"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Using data on nearly half a million people from the U.K., Oxford University researchers looked for patterns in who died prematurely, or before the age of 75. They also looked at markers of biological aging in a smaller subset of the study group (over 45,000 people). Their analysis included comparisons of genetic risk factors for disease as well as what some scientists have termed the “exposome.” Our DNA makes up our genome, whereas the exposome is made up of all the exposures we encounter throughout life. This includes everything from what we eat, drink and inhale to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/green-spaces-walking-paths-little-traffic-7-features-of-a-healthy-neighborhood-090012442.html" data-ylk="slk:neighborhoods we live in;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;neighborhoods we live in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics accounted for less than 2% of the difference in people’s risks of death, environmental factors were behind 17% of the disparity, the scientists found. Smoking, socioeconomic status — a measure of factors like income, neighborhood, education and occupation — physical activity levels and living conditions had the greatest influence on someone’s biological aging and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of these factors — such as how much money you make or whether you can afford to own a home in a nice neighborhood — are hard to change. But overall, 23 out of 25 of the environmental variables the researchers looked at are modifiable. And many of them are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-genes-not-matter-when-it-comes-to-longevity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do genes not matter when it comes to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No, they definitely do. But to what extent varies a lot depending on the specific genes, the diseases that they put you at risk for and what you do throughout your life. For example, which variants of the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/genes-known-increase-risk-alzheimer-151136656.html" data-ylk="slk:APOE gene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;APOE gene&lt;/a&gt; you carry is highly predictive of your risk for Alzheimer’s disease; the same goes for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jenna-wolfe-hysterectomy-brca-gene-232125745.html" data-ylk="slk:BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And these diseases can have a lot to do with your biological aging and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But even these genes are influenced by your behavior and environment. And, in most cases, our choices and the lives we lead have a huge impact on what those genes will mean for our health. “Someone put a comment on our paper, saying ‘genetics loads the dice, but it’s up to us to play our hand,’” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/people/austin-argentieri-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Austin Argentieri,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Austin Argentieri,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital who led the new study while he was a researcher at Oxford Population Health, tells Yahoo Life. Even if your genetic makeup predisposes you to diseases that could cut your life short, “in most cases, you can mitigate that risk through lifestyle, behavior, or taking different drugs or treatments,” explains Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="changes-that-can-set-you-up-for-a-longer-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes that can set you up for a longer life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="1-dont-smoke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By now, it’s hardly a surprise that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/smoking-rates-declining-too-lung-120036320.html" data-ylk="slk:smoking;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;smoking &lt;/a&gt;is bad for you. But, aside from a person’s age, smoking has a greater bearing on longevity and aging than any other factor — genetic or environmental — according to the new study. Second to age, the factor that most influenced mortality risk was “smoking pack years,” meaning the number of packs of cigarettes a person smoked daily, for how many years. And smoking status — whether someone currently, formerly or never smoked — was the fourth-most-influential factor (sex was third; men are more likely to die earlier than women). “If you can do one thing, don’t smoke,” says Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-get-good-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Get good sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are tired frequently or don’t get very much sleep at night are more likely to both age quickly and die prematurely. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-much-sleep-do-i-need-201727574.html" data-ylk="slk:How much sleep you need;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;How much sleep you need&lt;/a&gt; varies from person to person, but for most adults, you should aim to get seven to nine hours a night. And try to have good “&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sleep-hygiene-140453735.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;” by going to bed and waking at consistent times, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/babies-have-sleep-routines-heres-why-adults-should-too-205345568.html" data-ylk="slk:having a bedtime routine;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;having a bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;, keeping your room dark and keeping your phone away from your bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="3-get-moving"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After tiredness, physical activity “is close in the running for the top” factor influencing biological aging and risk of death, says Argentieri. That’s in part because many of the chronic conditions that accelerate aging and lead to early death are cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity increases risks for these conditions, while exercise, in combination with a healthy diet, can reduce those risks. Diet may have more influence, but “that doesn’t mean that exercise shouldn’t be part of the plan,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/longo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valter Longo;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Valter Longo&lt;/a&gt;, a University of Southern California professor of gerontology who studies how nutrition and fasting can influence longevity, tells Yahoo Life. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life-new-research-sheds-light-on-the-lifestyle-factors-that-matter-150908451.html" data-ylk="slk:In combination with other habits, exercising;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;In combination with other habits, exercising&lt;/a&gt; can help you live healthier, for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="4-eat-for-longer-living"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.

While some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6853289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it is marginal, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132306000242" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; from Finland suggests that it might be more significant. Take the office environment, for example. While it's unlikely that there's a temperature which pleases everyone due to our individual thermoregulation, overall the study found that women were often dissatisfied with the room temperature, feeling both uncomfortably colder and hotter than men. Another study of office temperatures in Japan showed a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778802000129" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;3.1C (37F) difference in neutral temperature&lt;/a&gt; between female and male workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the home, meanwhile, reaching an optimal core body temperature may not be a "golden ticket" to a perfect sleep, says Bill Wisden, a sleep expert and director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London, "but it would help".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sleep, he says, is "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938406003933" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;temporally related&lt;/a&gt; to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and skin temperature". In other words, a couple of hours before we go to sleep, our core body temperature begins to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; when melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep cycle, is produced. Body temperature continues to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; throughout the night reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually warming up as the morning progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One thing that can help you fall asleep is the "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;hot bath effect&lt;/a&gt;". Wisden says that having a hot bath before bedtime can help induce sleep. "We've done physiological experiments with mice and found that if you warm the skin, that sends signals to the hypothalamus in the base of the brain – and that triggers an induction of sleep and a cooling of the body." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, getting under a thick duvet at night can help the body prepare the body for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;longer episodes of sleep or deeper sleep.&lt;/a&gt; Snuggling up like this – to warm the skin – is not unique to humans. Wisden adds: "Pets, cats and dogs curl up – and some animals build a nest… that provides a kind of thermal insulation." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But once you're fast asleep, a cool room temperature is ideal: between 16-18C (60-65F). While &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37474050/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;older adults might sleep more comfortably&lt;/a&gt; in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393511500033X?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poor sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to waking up throughout the night, as well as a lack of non-REM sleep – the most &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;restful&lt;/a&gt; stage of sleep. "Being too hot during sleep is bad. It's exactly like a noise, or a sensation on your skin, or a pain. Being hot while you're asleep stimulates sensory perception and wakes you up," Wisden says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ultimately, while we can be guided by research, it seems it may be impossible to find an optimal temperature that will please everyone. From age to gender, hormones to metabolism, there are many factors at play that might influence whether you prefer a hotter or colder room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, the battle of the thermostat rages on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVUJuWWo0VEI4SnhuZ3oyUEtKRTJtbTRvSWVNS1FvdnQ2ckY4X0x2elJTdVEtVmNoTTItbkJwenQ2ajdyM05Fa0NtakJSQ3huMUY2aWNwNVJXUGdBeC1OS29hNTVVa2VEempNeWRXWV84UGwyVXVwQ1VTdFY1bnlGeWxxVF9iUFJhMnNLWEFrUElrcm5pUHpqSnN6d1RlOHM4V1FVamNzQVZ3ZmZ1ODdJbU41ZmVYTW1PcEE</guid></item><item><title>I tried walking yoga and I was amazed by how calm it made me feel - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNNzFvQmJ3LWRUejRsUHBPa0gyX3h4Rk1xRkJlVkJFQmZBZ3I5WHhwdDZPV0RCeWcxVTNKaVhYX0MzbDJ5QWN3Nk1fNzBDbGdzNGxON3dfQkRMZjNtZU9ZSXFsc3hJVG56LWdsdTNNQWw0WFVGMFJZR09vSHJmdUQwR3BPVEh3N2xPRnViSFZrTTQyR3pTLTdRTmlXTDkxMDZQVzA0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of walking and I do my best to hit 7,500 steps every day. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-mindful-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-mindful-walking"&gt;Mindful walking&lt;/a&gt; is nothing new to me, but I had never heard of walking yoga until Sophia Drozd, a yoga instructor and creator of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" data-url="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Yoga for Pain &lt;/a&gt;app, brought it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd explained that it was first established in the 1970s as a way of combining yoga and breathwork with an everyday activity: walking. I decided to give it a go, forgoing my usual headphones and music for some focus and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do it, all I had to do was synchronize my steps with my breath and be mindful of my body and surroundings while I walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-i-found"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I found: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You have to concentrate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This may seem obvious to anyone who has ever tried to pat their head and rub their tummy at the same time, but I was surprised at how much focus was required for me to synchronize my breathing with my steps. Because I was concentrating, my mind didn’t wander and I didn’t spend time analyzing my day — a habit that can make me feel stressed or anxious even in lovely weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mindfulness came naturally &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once my breath and steps were synchronized, I grew aware of my surroundings and how I felt in my body. I was amazed at how the breathwork made me feel, cutting through the noise in my head and reconnecting me with myself. The rhythmic, repetitive nature of syncing my breath and steps felt calming—almost hypnotic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I was more aware of the beauty around me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the distraction of my headphones or thoughts, I noticed the beauty of the natural world. I chose a fantastic day to try walking yoga: the sun was shining, the birds were chirping and I could smell spring in the air. When I got back and thought about it, I realized that the weather had been the same the day before. I just hadn’t noticed because I had been so wrapped up in my thoughts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It slowed down my walking pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I timed my inhale and exhale to coincide with my left foot striking the ground, so I was taking two steps per breath. This was only sustainable if I slowed my walking pace down. I tried other breathing patterns but nothing else worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-walking-yoga"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start walking yoga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start small," advises Drozd, "Especially if you're not a daily yogi or walker." She encourages starting with five minutes a day in a place you know well—your session could even form part of a larger walk. You can then gradually increase by five minutes every few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will give you time for your muscles to adjust to your new routine," she says. "Keep increasing until you get to 20 minutes a day. If you can't spare 20 minutes every day or want to mix walking yoga sessions into your weekly routine, I would recommend doing 30 minutes, three days a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular mindful practice for your mind and body can help reduce stress, boost your mood, and improve concentration and body awareness, says Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Sophia Drozd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.instagram.com/yogaforpainapp/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="INSTAGRAM"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon_instagram" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" fill="#de3073" r="12"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M18.958 9.116a5.121 5.121 0 00-.336-1.708 3.557 3.557 0 00-2.044-2.044 5.12 5.12 0 00-1.694-.322C14.142 5.014 13.89 5 12 5s-2.142.014-2.884.042a5.213 5.213 0 00-1.708.322 3.665 3.665 0 00-2.044 2.044 5.213 5.213 0 00-.322 1.708C5.014 9.858 5 10.1 5 12s.014 2.142.042 2.884a5.12 5.12 0 00.322 1.694 3.44 3.44 0 00.812 1.246 3.4 3.4 0 001.232.8 5.175 5.175 0 001.708.336c.742.028.98.042 2.884.042s2.142-.014 2.884-.042a5.082 5.082 0 001.694-.336 3.456 3.456 0 002.044-2.044 5.006 5.006 0 00.336-1.694C18.986 14.142 19 13.9 19 12s-.014-2.142-.042-2.884zM17.7 14.828a3.946 3.946 0 01-.252 1.3 2.189 2.189 0 01-.518.8 2.165 2.165 0 01-.8.532 4.641 4.641 0 01-1.3.238c-.742.028-.966.042-2.828.042s-2.1-.014-2.828-.042a3.837 3.837 0 01-1.3-.252A2.258 2.258 0 016.54 16.13a3.91 3.91 0 01-.238-1.3c-.028-.742-.042-.966-.042-2.828s.014-2.086.042-2.828a3.787 3.787 0 01.238-1.3A2.445 2.445 0 017.87 6.54a3.856 3.856 0 011.3-.238c.742-.028.952-.042 2.828-.042s2.086.014 2.828.042a3.787 3.787 0 011.3.238 2.445 2.445 0 011.33 1.33 4.641 4.641 0 01.238 1.3c.027.742.042.952.042 2.828s-.011 2.088-.036 2.83zM12 8.4a3.6 3.6 0 103.6 3.6A3.6 3.6 0 0012 8.4zm.181 5.929a2.338 2.338 0 01-.362-4.662 2.43 2.43 0 01.362 0 2.338 2.338 0 010 4.662zm3.557-6.909a.84.84 0 11-.84.84.84.84 0 01.84-.838z" fill="#fff"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Drozd is the owner and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga for Pain&lt;/a&gt;  (Y4P), and is a qualified yoga teacher, lifelong practitioner and chronic pain warrior.

&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece published by Fox News on Sunday, Kennedy said he was “deeply concerned” about the spread of the disease despite earlier suggesting that it was “not unusual”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 4 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 4 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” Kennedy wrote, though he said the decision to vaccinate is “a personal one”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of health and human services said that before the introduction of the MMR vaccine, “virtually every child” in the US contracted measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For example, in the United States, from 1953 to 1962, on average there were 530,217 confirmed cases and 440 deaths, a case fatality rate of 1 in 1,205 cases,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US authorities last month reported the first measles death in the country in a decade after an unvaccinated school-aged child was hospitalised with the disease in northwest Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, 146 cases had been identified in the state since late January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have said the cases have been concentrated in a community of Mennonites, a Christian sect that arose out of the radical factions of the 16th-century Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a href="/news/2025/1/29/rfk-jrs-view-on-vaccines-comes-under-fire-at-contentious-us-senate-hearing"&gt;promoted scientifically discredited research&lt;/a&gt; linking vaccines to autism, attracted criticism last month when he appeared to downplay the outbreak by pointing out there had been several outbreaks already this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be highly dangerous for people who are not vaccinated, including young infants who are not typically eligible for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated individuals in the US who gets measles is hospitalised, while about one out of every 20 children with the disease gets pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MONTGOMERY CO., Pa. - "They took the appropriate precautions, they did the appropriate testing," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the county, people may have been exposed on a China Airlines shuttle bus departing JFK Airport, arriving in North Philadelphia February 25th into the 26th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Children's Hospital on the 26th, the county said people may also have been exposed at True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth in Plymouth Meeting on the same date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that the vaccine is highly effective against measles," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said droplets can linger for two hours in a space after someone with the virus leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lorraine said the county maintains fairly good vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke about what symptoms come along with measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically, we'll see pretty high fevers and all the concomitant symptoms that would be associated with that, it can cause seizures if it becomes significantly elevated, cough, shortness of breath. These are all very, very common," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said in Texas there is a spread within a population that is specifically unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our situation is definitely different. This is essentially a one-off. It was a case of a child who was too young to be vaccinated traveled to an area where measles happens to be endemic and happened to unfortunately contract the disease," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lorraine said if you suspect you have measles, to seek medical attention and to let the facility you are going to know you are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the best defense is to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Danielle Roberts, from North Wales, told the BBC that she experienced financial "strain" as soon as her nine-year-old daughter Jasmine was diagnosed with cancer last year, but she did not receive any benefits for eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We were just thrown into this world where...our child's got cancer and we don't know if she's going to survive, along with dealing with the financial impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You've still got all these bills to pay on top of going back and forward to hospital, which was an hour and 15 minutes away, extra food, accommodation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Roberts said having to take long periods off work added to the financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My income was dramatically reduced because it's hard to work when your child is in hospital... and you don't want to work, you should be able to spend time with your child when they're poorly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2

heartbreaking," Young People vs Cancer's chief executive Rachel Kirby-Rider told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People don't have that disposable income, they don't have that money in savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Having to wait seven months for disability benefits is driving a lot of families into debt and impacting families at a time they just want to concentrate on getting their child well." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The charity is also concerned about the application process, as the 50-page forms were "tricky, long and complex", asking families for detailed descriptions about their child's needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The process should be made "simple and efficient", it says, by using medical evidence alone to make applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Roberts said she struggled to find the "head space" to complete the application form when her daughter Jasmine was ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They asked so many questions and you've got to send added proof... you don't want to have to think about that really as well as 'is my child going to be OK?'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's something that shouldn't have to be done when you're going through that traumatic time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: "We are committed to ensuring people can access financial support through Personal Independence Payment and Disability Living Allowance for children in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But we recognise waits are too high, and we have increased the number of staff to respond to the increase in claim volumes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64209221" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;high numbers of extra deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was," says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;The King's Fund&lt;/a&gt;. "But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the "bottom of the pack of comparable countries," she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Causes and risk factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the "low hanging fruit" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;latest official figures&lt;/a&gt;. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK," said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for "urgent government action" in its prevention, detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Deaths at younger ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the CMI found "really significant differences" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a "concerning" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group," says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;About the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:47:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBqS1V5aFFsZ05ER3NMa0lPYnZUNjZFLTUzWkE5RzdUVVRYVGphNU1mMDUyZDI3TnlQY0lCaEdpUlM3b2ttOE1DVDE5NG1FdU5PaUx1WlJ2MjJGUdIBX0FVX3lxTFBhNnk5d0lhcjFNMktBQ1BudFlhQVR5a3Y2ZmZCZGJRcllocktMR0s2blo5bXJDeFl3d1I4LXhlZ0lOc0NQZnNTMjJEbDZJOXlWZ2NfTGxPd3d6STJISWxV</guid></item><item><title>9 reasons to have black coffee in the morning - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxPVEQzU2hYZUQtWlNfZ29VckdTZnpOX29Eb3NxNjRzQVJyOHFWckItbXlWRzU4dnp1dmdIZWtmcDRWM0YzS2lMTmRmX3VlcG5kTFphVEFfWEZTRllLRHdsU0F4Zm9nalpWbzQwakVmRnQ5ZktPWFJNeFQ5cTQxQnZSOFNVWmdzaU4tOHA5ZXp4M2VVRnlPMXBWdEd2azNNNlJlRWJEaVcyNTZ4cDZaNHNUZkVUbmp0MkkyWG5oZ2NBVXN1aHptT2hQMmpKSjFHTWZZNFBIUjlPaWxnV0dt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;How Varun Chakravarthy worked on his phy...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 rules of intermittent fasting for hea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3AFBVV95cUxPVEQzU2hYZUQtWlNfZ29VckdTZnpOX29Eb3NxNjRzQVJyOHFWckItbXlWRzU4dnp1dmdIZWtmcDRWM0YzS2lMTmRmX3VlcG5kTFphVEFfWEZTRllLRHdsU0F4Zm9nalpWbzQwakVmRnQ5ZktPWFJNeFQ5cTQxQnZSOFNVWmdzaU4tOHA5ZXp4M2VVRnlPMXBWdEd2azNNNlJlRWJEaVcyNTZ4cDZaNHNUZkVUbmp0MkkyWG5oZ2NBVXN1aHptT2hQMmpKSjFHTWZZNFBIUjlPaWxnV0dt</guid></item><item><title>The US Is Withdrawing From Global Health at a Dangerous Time - Bloomberg</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOc1ZIc1FZRWFDOE5GMFJuN3FKM0tzX21LaG9vTFlhbzVSdHVjUXJjZ2ZEVW5iQ1J1eWZlRW0xLUhPYVctRUZjb2kyRUZ5ZmQxQlFJRFAyOVV1ZWxUS0dFbTJVSUxuMGs5Vnk1NkRtQ1RiNFZGTHdKODczb1ZxM3BOSGVGa0U4bFJ0RUs5TTNwc1EydTVyLWpUYVZpUG9BM3hVdS1ucWdyUUstaWJHbWVFM0VJNUZldm9R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content"&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;To keep an eye on some of the world’s most dangerous infectious diseases, scientists rely on reports from the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/initiatives/measles-and-rubella-laboratory-network" title="Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network&lt;/a&gt;. Known affectionately as Gremlin, it’s a grouping of more than 700 international labs that test about 500,000 patient samples annually. Gremlin monitors the prevalence of a huge range of pathogens in addition to those in its full name, including Covid-19, RSV, dengue, yellow fever and Ebola. And it does so on a remarkably modest budget: just $8 million a year, or less than 10% of the price tag for a single &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-15/cost-of-sustaining-lockheed-s-f-35-jet-now-forecast-to-exceed-1-5-trillion" title="Cost of Sustaining Lockheed’s F-35 Jet Now Forecast to Exceed $1.5 Trillion" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;F-35 fighter jet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;Yet the program, which is managed by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, is suddenly on the brink of extinction. Gremlin depends on money from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flagship US public-health agency. Since its establishment in 1946, the Atlanta-based CDC has worked on the front lines of every significant infectious disease outbreak, and if any of the threats that Gremlin tracks become a major problem, the agency will be expected to play the same role again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of Public Health said Sunday that the case involved an unvaccinated child who lives in the county. The child’s hometown was not released.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is now underway and people who may have been exposed are being contacted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed at the following times and locations:

People who were at any of these locations during the identified time periods may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 25-26, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Departing JFK Airport Terminal 4, arriving at North Philadelphia, Pho Ha Saigon, 757 Adams Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From February 25 at 9:30 p.m. to February 26 at 3:15 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3031 Walton Rd., #C101, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:45. a.m. - 2:15 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 26, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHOP King of Prussia Campus Emergency Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;550 S.

Since 2021, the region has faced “an acute upsurge” in cholera, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WH3JJSEDA5F43CQT6VXOUX4EKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Out of 27 African countries participating in the study, just three — Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia — were on track to meet the region’s goal of eliminating cholera by 2030, the study found. While the region was on track with efforts such as mapping hot spots and setting up surveillance systems, the researchers found, it lags on milestones involving increased funding for cholera control and elimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMGF7HNYP5H5ZFZEEIOKH2GWG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Insufficient water, sanitation and hygiene efforts and fragile health-care systems are to blame, the researchers write — and climate change, war and poverty are making things worse. Overall, the researchers found, the region had progressed by just 53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FANVINFOBZBKLGMTENJKM2UBA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One issue is that some countries treat cholera outbreaks as an emergency instead of investing in long-term infrastructure to combat the disease, the researchers write. The region needs “sustainable and predictable” funding to meet its goals, they note.

Cholera is most prevalent in places that lack sanitation due to poverty, poor infrastructure, war and weak health systems. Though it’s easy to treat and there are vaccines available, outbreaks have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;risen&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CKAICIK2MVE6XJCRGXHFZGPGSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-cholera-outbreak--external-situation-report--22---24-january-2025" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the WHO documented more than 800,000 cases of cholera and 5,805 deaths in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCHK2JSGNRFTBJKDLU3MHVNUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-cholera-outbreak--external-situation-report--23--20-february-2025" target="_blank"&gt;most recent data release&lt;/a&gt;, 19 countries nationwide had cholera cases in January, led by South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Africa region and Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan in the Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="COKY34CHNBB4JFZ6PCIJ6Z3ZPY" data-apitype="header" level="6" id="COKY34CHNBB4JFZ6PCIJ6Z3ZPY"&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 19:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOdHRYX19Ua0NldVphZ2thaHhOWm9kVlc1UEFQdmZTY1FocTR1OU5uNHl4LXRBZVdvSEp2LXJKN0d5MUJ2S2twOUlRc0pPXzVhU1kwZUFKOTZxemhUSE1PWHVidTM1bzFlWFFuOFRJQkY1d182dng3aHRtYVpyQ29CZ1BJSjBlUWdZNk8wejBiTQ</guid></item><item><title>Lifesaving drug successfully lowers cholesterol levels and body weight - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQR3MwNUtJRmdwOTdPa0Q3VWRSZ3RSX2ROYldlLUZnX1hjaFpUckMtN3lhRXRpZTd6YTBkcURNTmxKNDdZalJ0bU1VTmZHYWNmcy1nandwaTQxYzNLdXRfQkJqWmt3QTFkd1g5Q0FzNEJOVWpFRFRXNXE3YU1xRlY3blczd29uRERtaDI2N3ZIZGZDd1hERi15YXJ2N2h6a0pqeHk1dkNoMm5COTcyVXoxXw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million Americans struggle with obesity and related metabolic disorders, a staggering number with widespread consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were really excited about this work," says S. Thai Thayumanavan, a biomedical engineer and chemist at the &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/a&gt;. This technique takes on greater significance when viewed against the broader health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this breakthrough is a tiny yet powerful tool—nanogels. These microscopic carriers hold a synthetic thyroid hormone drug known as a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/dna-based-nanotransporters-revolutionize-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thyromimetic&lt;/a&gt;. While thyroid hormones are vital for liver metabolism, their systemic use often leads to severe side effects, making them an unreliable treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than administering the hormone throughout the body, researchers designed nanogels to deliver it precisely where it's needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A graphic depicting how the drug targets the liver.

"They were custom-designed for hepatocyte delivery in the liver." This precision avoids the harmful effects associated with traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Mice given the treatment lost all the excess weight they had gained, with no harmful side effects. "The treated mice completely lost their gained weight, and we did not see any untoward side effects," Thayumanavan reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits went beyond weight loss. Despite remaining on a high-fat diet, the mice showed improved cholesterol levels and significantly reduced &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-first-successful-in-patient-trial-of-liver-dialysis-has-been-completed/"&gt;liver inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. The findings suggest a deeper metabolic shift rather than just a temporary fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that we are activating the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which lowers cholesterol," Thayumanavan explains. This discovery points to a potential long-term solution for obesity-related conditions, offering hope for safer and more effective metabolic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further theorizes, "We believe that activation of fat oxidation and an &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/waist-not-want-not-new-discovery-on-belly-fat-and-diabetic-risk-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increase in metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt; are causing the loss in weight, but more work needs to be done to prove that point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving into the mechanics, once these nanogels permeate the hepatocytes, the liver cell environment disintegrates the bonds within the nanogel, releasing axitirome. This drug subsequently latches onto &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/blood-proteins-could-be-the-key-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; pivotal for gene expression regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apparent effectiveness of the ANG-delivered axitirome, which reversed weight gain without disrupting thyroid hormone levels, indicates a promising avenue for thyromimetics in addressing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-drug-fights-obesity-and-diabetes-by-transforming-bad-fats-into-good-fats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic diseases like obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A scanning electron micrograph of a section through a vein in the liver, showing red blood cells surrounded by hepatocytes (green).

This is in stark contrast to human subjects using other &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-weight-loss-drug-could-be-stronger-than-ozempic-and-as-powerful-as-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant amount of development work to be conducted between mice and humans," Thayumanavan cautions, "but we are hoping it will eventually become a drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven by the promise of the nanogel technology his lab birthed, Thayumanavan has launched a startup, Cyta Therapeutics.

But, if you want to learn more about things you can do to lower your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a37271432/depression-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, these findings are definitely worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the researchers found, plus what a dietitian and psychologist want you to keep in mind when interpreting the study's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, is co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thea Gallagher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thea Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, is a clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmind-in-view%2Fid1544156706&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa63975392%2Forange-citrus-depression-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mind in View;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mind in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast; &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/gail-m-saltz-md/1095-park-avenue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Saltz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed data from nearly 32,500 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study 2, a longitudinal study that tracked women to learn more about chronic disease risk factors. Researchers also looked at data from more than 300 men. They then used that information, along with fecal (i.e. poop) samples to learn more about the participants’ gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when people had a daily serving of citrus, it lowered their risk of developing depression by about 20 percent. This was unique to citrus—meaning, data didn’t establish the same link with other fruits or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers drilled down even more, they found that the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii)&lt;/em&gt;, which is found in the gut microbiome of people who eat citrus fruits, was more abundant in people who weren't depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These data underscore the role of diet in the prevention of depression, and offer a plausible explanation for how the intestinal microbiome modulates the influence of citrus on mental health,” the researchers wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does gut bacteria influence your mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria in your gut, a.k.a. your gut microbiome, play a “crucial role” in your mental health by influencing the production of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that help cells “talk” to each other), bodily inflammation, and the integrity of your gut barrier, says Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain gut bacteria, like &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt;, contribute to the gut-brain axis, a bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain,” Keatley says. This particular bacteria is especially important because it can help to reduce inflammation, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since chronic inflammation has been linked to depression, increasing &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; in the gut [by way of consuming citrus] may help regulate mood by reducing inflammatory markers,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while the gut-brain relationship is firmly established, the way this pathway actually functions on a cellular level is still being explored. “We don’t fully understand the pathways between gut health and depression,” says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thea Gallagher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thea Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, a clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmind-in-view%2Fid1544156706&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa63975392%2Forange-citrus-depression-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mind in View;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mind in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast. “But we do know there’s something there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many oranges do you have to eat to see benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study found that eating one medium orange a day could help lower your risk of depression. But the researchers also lumped all citrus together. So, if you’re a grapefruit fan, you can feel good knowing that you’re also doing your mental health a solid by having a daily serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is citrus so special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about citrus that seem to give it extra oomph when it comes to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real game-changer in citrus is its high concentration of flavonoids, such as naringenin and formononetin,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These flavonoids help support the growth of the essential bacteria &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii, &lt;/em&gt;and also may regulate processes in the gut that help increase the availability of our "feel-good" neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, in the body, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind that the study's findings don't actually &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that consuming citrus influences your mental health—they just establish a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also only looks at one aspect of citrus' impact on the gut, and specifically, the bacterial link, points out &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/gail-m-saltz-md/1095-park-avenue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Saltz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citrus may impact the gut biome, but it also has other features, such as high vitamin C, which could figure into this story," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other foods that can lower depression risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between eating a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression, which suggests that eating whole, unprocessed foods may be better for your mental and physical health, Gallagher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher adds that focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods that don’t have a lot of ingredients is the “safe route” when it comes to eating for mental health. But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80/20 style of eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kimchi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:58:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBMSjRLSDRkY1hZdnNNaVM3U0dCM3dKcUNBS041NktmTWtFYkk4S0hudDlMUkdPQlc3d0VpNmpEc3FiejZlOE5qbXFTS3ZYM0VHOWVHREhtc2Vyd1BPd21CRzM1d0s1VXRmZURxamRjWUp1dw</guid></item><item><title>Herpes Wakes Up: Scientists Discover Hidden Trigger for Cold Sore Flare-Ups - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPR2dqVjhiaVNkTklDdjY2UG8yTk1TMWRNT19WRmY5Y01WaHdCMl9aNE9sTHBXYVFCVHY4dC02TEpGX1g0WXZ4Mk9XNU9LSEFqVUhHcDBQMDF2S1MzZ1VwYUpoMTJ1X2VDZVg4NjBSRTFwaV85VVdoUXlIclZJWjdUOW00YjM2UXB1WlA3bEZXekdrbHlBcFNvV3YtSXhLTWNiaHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:30:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPR2dqVjhiaVNkTklDdjY2UG8yTk1TMWRNT19WRmY5Y01WaHdCMl9aNE9sTHBXYVFCVHY4dC02TEpGX1g0WXZ4Mk9XNU9LSEFqVUhHcDBQMDF2S1MzZ1VwYUpoMTJ1X2VDZVg4NjBSRTFwaV85VVdoUXlIclZJWjdUOW00YjM2UXB1WlA3bEZXekdrbHlBcFNvV3YtSXhLTWNiaHc</guid></item><item><title>I’m a Dietitian and This Is My Favorite Healthy High-Protein Granola Bar - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Wb2tTZWJ6Mk5INmVzZ2lFbmRlMHlaOHJMOC1CMWFWQWRnelBmYm1CREVhRlhVM3lULTc4Zl9RSHpLU0pPaFo5ZUpHRlZPS19zRjlLV0IyOTVneUx3YlhMR0ZPVUlSWFAwTXRybnIzQTVodzlFM284?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Kelli McGrane, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating Well / Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I’m all about convenience. After all, so many of us live such fast-paced lives that I always encourage my clients and readers to lean on nutritious foods that don’t require a ton of work to prepare. Granola bars are one great example. You can grab one to eat in the car while you drive to work or throw one in your daily carry bag to munch on if hunger strikes unexpectedly. However, granola bars can be a sneaky source of not-so-healthy things like added sugars and saturated fat. Eating too much saturated fat and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;—which most Americans do—can lead to health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m sharing my favorite healthy granola bar—Clif Nut Butter Bars. With these bars, you don’t have to sacrifice taste for nutrition. They’re stuffed with satisfying nut butter for a creamy treat full of heart-healthy fats, plant protein and fiber. Plus, they have far less added sugar and saturated fat than many other options out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7829052/breakfast-bars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Better for You Breakfast Bars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Better for You Breakfast Bars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why I Love Clif Nut Butter Bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Great Taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever said that healthy food can’t taste good was wrong. And let’s be real—if something doesn’t taste good, you’re probably not going to want to eat it anyway. One of the main reasons I love these Clif Nut Butter Bars is that they taste so good! They have a similar texture to classic Clif bars, but they’re smaller and they have a creamy nut butter filling. This makes them feel decadent and satisfying in a whole new way. You might even want one after dinner for dessert!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Source of Plant Protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re reaching for a granola bar for a snack or a quick breakfast, protein is key. It helps you feel full so you’re held over until your next meal or snack. It also helps prevent blood sugar spikes so you can feel a steady rise in energy rather than a big burst and then a dramatic crash. I love that this Clif Nut Butter Bar has 7 grams of protein per serving. It’s all &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; from peanuts and pea protein, making it vegetarian-friendly. Paired with a cup of milk (which has 8 grams of protein), it makes for an excellent high-protein post-workout snack to support muscle growth and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960613/are-peanuts-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Are Peanuts Healthy? Here's What a Dietitian Has to Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Are Peanuts Healthy? Here's What a Dietitian Has to Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contain Heart-Healthy Fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, many granola bars are high in saturated fat—the kind that’s bad for heart health. Compared to other options, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in saturated fat, with 2.5 grams per bar. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating no more than 22 grams of saturated fat per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these bars especially great, though, is that they’re a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy unsaturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because they use real peanut butter and peanuts, which are rich in monounsaturated fat. This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type of fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type of fat&lt;/a&gt; can help lower cholesterol levels to lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Just like protein, it also helps slow digestion to prevent blood sugar spikes, making this a blood sugar–friendly snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Have a Few Grams of Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key nutrient I look for in granola bars is fiber. Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:don’t eat nearly enough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;don’t eat nearly enough&lt;/a&gt; of this important carb, and little adjustments can go a long way (like finding a higher-fiber granola bar!). Each Clif Nut Butter Bar has 3 grams of fiber—about 11% of the Daily Value.  There are other bars out there with even more fiber, but they tend to be higher in saturated fat and/or added sugars. I really like the overall nutritional balance of these bars. If you’re looking to add more fiber, pair the bar with a banana or a couple of Medjool dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relatively Low in Added Sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to other granola bars, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in added sugars. Each bar has 6 grams. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines recommend eating no more than 50 grams of added sugars per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet. Other granola bars can have upward of 12 grams of added sugars. They may also use stevia or artificial sweeteners, which I personally don’t love the taste of. So I love that these bars have a delicious flavor without too many added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-bar-recipes-you-ll-want-to-make-forever-8743366" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 Breakfast Bars You'll Want to Make Forever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;16 Breakfast Bars You'll Want to Make Forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need a granola bar to grab and go, I recommend Clif Nut Butter Bars. Compared to other granola bars, they have a good balance of fiber, healthy fat and protein, with minimal added sugars and saturated fat. Plus, they’re super tasty! I love having one of these bars as a part of a quick breakfast or an afternoon snack. They’re also great to pair with a glass of milk for a high-protein, post-workout snack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-healthy-high-protein-granola-bar-11686872" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:24:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Wb2tTZWJ6Mk5INmVzZ2lFbmRlMHlaOHJMOC1CMWFWQWRnelBmYm1CREVhRlhVM3lULTc4Zl9RSHpLU0pPaFo5ZUpHRlZPS19zRjlLV0IyOTVneUx3YlhMR0ZPVUlSWFAwTXRybnIzQTVodzlFM284</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu detected in nearby Pa. county - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQQVUyRVlFN3FoM0pyNjZWUnVCVlZOa25mZ0lSd2FqbG9NWTdIMkJjOEVZMEdjYmZCYm9XZWxlMFh2SEtiTS1NUnRuM0tYZF9XdDhRTjk4dzlqMlRjUUJYUVpqblByTnAtVmNfdkhkVDFoWDBkUFZwTmx4eGdmZkpmTHNDUdIBiAFBVV95cUxNOVRra3RhTVFHRjFhOGpTZTNWeWNzWHpSYzVfVGxqMjQyRmlpUm1LWUlSeEswNzdKc1dBTWkxN09YTHNVc0JVcUR2V3dnZXZ5RGo2dVQ5RFl0c1RKakJUNjBQWnQwNEdBTkhtQl9mY1N2Rks5WjFmZW40Z0JfQVp4RWZLMnZZVUJm?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Measles continues its march. And influencers who contributed to this debacle are trying to downplay its seriousness and dodge responsibility for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationwide in the US there are 164 cases as of Wednesday, with Texas contributing 146 of those.  Expect another disturbing update soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-kids-cases-what-know-rcna194216" target="_blank"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you thought America was uniquely idiotic about infectious disease:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australian vaccination rates &lt;/strong&gt;are down to 83%.  And last year they had 57,000 whooping cough cases. This continued in January of this year, with almost 5,000 cases in one month. They also have a few measles cases in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov.au/newsroom/news-and-articles/whooping-cough-still-lingers" target="_blank"&gt;Australian CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a measles outbreak over 150 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario has over 140 measles cases, which is more than the total they have had in the past 10 years &lt;em&gt;combined. &lt;/em&gt;They also have falling vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/measles-cases-ontario-double-last-two-weeks-1.7470166" target="_blank"&gt;Doubled in the past two weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has not used vitamin A at the WHO recommended protocol which does reduce morbidity and mortality in deficient children.  Americans hate to admit they might be deficient in anything at all, but a lot of us are.  In any case, measles actively depletes vitamin A stores, so a large loading dose can be useful in hospitalized children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/Fulltext/2020/07000/Vitamin_A_for_the_Management_of_Measles_in_the.2.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;LWW.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New studies on Covid patients in France who were hospitalized show them at higher risk for death and readmission for as much as 2.5 years afterward.  This risk is highest for the first six months.&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/hospitalized-covid-patients-higher-risk-organ-related-death-readmission-25-years-data" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey reports its first H5N1 infections in cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/new-jersey-reports-h5-avian-flu-cluster-cats" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO is recommending that next year’s flu vaccines use a different clade of the H3N2 subtype. This type changes more frequently than most of the other flus. Pandemic preparedness researches also pointed out a strain of H5N1 and one of H5N6 to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/who-advisers-swap-out-h3n2-strains-next-northern-hemisphere-flu-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that 13% of children who died of flu this year had brain damage.  Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that 13% of children who have died from seasonal flu this season had influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), a severe neurologic complication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in these cases are four patients who had acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), the most severe form of IAE, which can lead to varying degrees of brain dysfunction, inflammation, and other neurologic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data has not been consistently gathered so it is not known if this is worse than average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers," the authors wrote. "Health care providers should consider IAE in children with febrile illness and clinically compatible neurologic signs or symptoms, including but not limited to seizures, altered mental status, delirium, decreased level of consciousness, lethargy, hallucinations, or personality changes lasting &amp;gt;24 hours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Given the precarious state of public health agencies under the Orange Menace, it is my hope that the information &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; can be infectious, spread widely to all your contacts, in the hope of promoting self-defense from disease. Knowledge is the best inoculation against misinformation!&lt;/p&gt;

After all, so many of us live such fast-paced lives that I always encourage my clients and readers to lean on nutritious foods that don’t require a ton of work to prepare. Granola bars are one great example. You can grab one to eat in the car while you drive to work or throw one in your daily carry bag to munch on if hunger strikes unexpectedly. However, granola bars can be a sneaky source of not-so-healthy things like added sugars and saturated fat. Eating too much saturated fat and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;—which most Americans do—can lead to health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s why I’m sharing my favorite healthy granola bar—Clif Nut Butter Bars. With these bars, you don’t have to sacrifice taste for nutrition. They’re stuffed with satisfying nut butter for a creamy treat full of heart-healthy fats, plant protein and fiber. Plus, they have far less added sugar and saturated fat than many other options out there. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-i-love-clif-nut-butter-bars"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why I Love Clif Nut Butter Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Great Taste &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whoever said that healthy food can’t taste good was wrong. And let’s be real—if something doesn’t taste good, you’re probably not going to want to eat it anyway. One of the main reasons I love these Clif Nut Butter Bars is that they taste so good! They have a similar texture to classic Clif bars, but they’re smaller and they have a creamy nut butter filling. This makes them feel decadent and satisfying in a whole new way. You might even want one after dinner for dessert!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Good Source of Plant Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re reaching for a granola bar for a snack or a quick breakfast, protein is key. It helps you feel full so you’re held over until your next meal or snack. It also helps prevent blood sugar spikes so you can feel a steady rise in energy rather than a big burst and then a dramatic crash. I love that this Clif Nut Butter Bar has 7 grams of protein per serving. It’s all &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; from peanuts and pea protein, making it vegetarian-friendly. Paired with a cup of milk (which has 8 grams of protein), it makes for an excellent high-protein post-workout snack to support muscle growth and recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contain Heart-Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As I mentioned above, many granola bars are high in saturated fat—the kind that’s bad for heart health. Compared to other options, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in saturated fat, with 2.5 grams per bar. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating no more than 22 grams of saturated fat per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes these bars especially great, though, is that they’re a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because they use real peanut butter and peanuts, which are rich in monounsaturated fat. This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;type of fat&lt;/a&gt; can help lower cholesterol levels to lower your risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Just like protein, it also helps slow digestion to prevent blood sugar spikes, making this a blood sugar–friendly snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Have a Few Grams of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another key nutrient I look for in granola bars is fiber. Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;don’t eat nearly enough&lt;/a&gt; of this important carb, and little adjustments can go a long way (like finding a higher-fiber granola bar!). Each Clif Nut Butter Bar has 3 grams of fiber—about 11% of the Daily Value.  There are other bars out there with even more fiber, but they tend to be higher in saturated fat and/or added sugars. I really like the overall nutritional balance of these bars. If you’re looking to add more fiber, pair the bar with a banana or a couple of Medjool dates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Relatively Low in Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Compared to other granola bars, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in added sugars. Each bar has 6 grams. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines recommend eating no more than 50 grams of added sugars per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Other granola bars can have upward of 12 grams of added sugars. They may also use stevia or artificial sweeteners, which I personally don’t love the taste of. So I love that these bars have a delicious flavor without too many added sugars.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you need a granola bar to grab and go, I recommend Clif Nut Butter Bars. Compared to other granola bars, they have a good balance of fiber, healthy fat and protein, with minimal added sugars and saturated fat. Plus, they’re super tasty! I love having one of these bars as a part of a quick breakfast or an afternoon snack. They’re also great to pair with a glass of milk for a high-protein, post-workout snack.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although all vegetables bring a level of healthiness to the equation, as well as properties that can help prevent diseases and ailments, not every vegetable can do it all. That's why maintaining a well-rounded, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/978563/tips-to-help-you-move-toward-a-healthier-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy daily diet&lt;/a&gt; full of nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants is necessary not just for feeling good, but for improving your chances for a long life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the vegetables that fits the bill when it comes to preventing some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. is cauliflower. This delicious and versatile veggie contains nutrients that can help stave off cancer, heart disease, and even &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/453921/different-types-of-diabetes-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. "Cauliflower is rich in plant compounds, including phytonutrients that act as antioxidants, helping to protect cells from damage," &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" target="_blank"&gt;Kat Benson&lt;/a&gt;, a Registered Dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, told Health Digest exclusively, adding that these compounds in addition to cauliflower's high fiber content, keep cholesterol and inflammation levels in the healthy range, making it great for heart health. "Cauliflower's fiber and low-carb profile can also help stabilize blood sugar, which is beneficial for diabetes management," said Benson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those are the major benefits of eating cauliflower, they're also just the tip of the iceberg. It seems cauliflower has even more to offer, so it just might be time to start eating it, if you don't already, or begin to eat it more regularly if it's something that you only sometimes include in your meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to lose weight or maintain a certain weight, cauliflower can help. Not only is it low in calories, containing just 27 calories per cup, but thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/435316/eat-these-foods-if-you-need-more-fiber/" target="_blank"&gt;high fiber count&lt;/a&gt;, cauliflower will make you feel fuller longer, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589116/" target="_blank"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients. "Additionally, regular fiber intake promotes digestive health by supporting regular bowel movements and overall digestive function, contributing to a healthy colon," said Benson. It is also a water-dense vegetable, consisting of 92.1% water. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4848697/" target="_blank"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, also published in Nutrients, found that water-dense foods have the ability to aid in weight loss, especially in those who are categorized as obese.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower is also rich in choline, with 44.3 milligrams per cup, as well as sulforaphane. While the former is essential in promoting healthy body functioning, like cell growth and metabolism health, per a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6213596/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients, sulforaphane, which is a specific antioxidant, is potentially effective against cancer in animals. It may also possibly slow &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1641518/what-are-the-5-warning-signs-of-prostate-cancer/" target="_blank"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30652644/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Current Pharmaceutical Design.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's so great about cauliflower is all the ways in which it can be prepared. For example, if you're looking for low-carb options, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/346128/this-is-how-healthy-cauliflower-substitutes-really-are/" target="_blank"&gt;cauliflower is a substitute&lt;/a&gt; that can easily replace the macaroni in mac and cheese and the potatoes in mashed potatoes. It can also be put in a food processor so it can be made into dough for pizza or tortillas. However, if you really love the taste of cauliflower, you're less likely to get the full flavor when it's incorporated this way into recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way [to eat it] is the way you'll enjoy it," said Benson. "A great way is to pair it with some fat (like olive oil or avocado oil) to help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamin K. Roasted with other veggies, seasoned with salt and pepper, is always a simple, delicious option." How you choose to include more cauliflower into your diet is your call. So let yourself get creative and finally realize that, wow, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/382239/cauliflower-grits-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;cauliflower grits&lt;/a&gt; are so delicious, so how the heck did you live so long without them? Paired with some fruit and an egg for protein, and you've got yourself a healthy way to start your day.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, the team found that their technique generated sufficient protein to protect the mice's DNA from radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same method, they hope, could eventually be used in human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting," MIT associate professor of mechanical engineering Giovanni Traverso in a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/tiny-tardigrades-protein-may-help-cancer-patients-tolerate-radiation-therapy-0226" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effects of radiation treatment can be brutal, from mouth sores to rectal bleeding. Scientists have come up with drugs that reduce this damage, but only to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In search for a better option, the researchers drew inspiration from tardigrades and their incredible survival ability. A suppressor protein, dubbed Dsup, helps to protect the tardigrades' DNA from radiation-induced damage by binding to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to MIT, this protein allows the tiny creatures to survive doses 2,000 to 3,000 times higher than what humans can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By delivering this protein through messenger RNA encoding, the team found that the Dsup protein was expressed successfully in the colon and mouth tissues in mice, two areas that are susceptible to radiation-induced damage in human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it’s considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells’ genome," Kirtane explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping cancer patients during radiation therapy, the researchers suggest it could also help patients receiving chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could even help astronauts from suffering radiation damage, since long voyages through space, such as a trip to Mars, would &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mars-astronauts-radiation-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;expose future space travelers to dangerous levels&lt;/a&gt; of cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another possible application would be to help prevent radiation damage in astronauts in space," MIT enthused in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on tardigrades:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientists-tardigrades-star-systems" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Scientists Propose Sending Small Creatures to Neighboring Star Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 14:00:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNR1JTVG5GdjNOZDBaeFpUNTBNMkxxby1HbFVBVmZ5ZF9MRTJIeGNVY01rZlhxb21qbjNhVGF4N0Rta1U5ZW9uLWpXd2JISThxUV9WYWgyMU1lTHlmNkdWb3p6OWg0R1RjczBoQjJZVWRYZUFqZURFLTYwYm82bkFaX1hxdDVza2E0UVQw</guid></item><item><title>How much has bird flu spread in WA? - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOWHRVYm5xZElLMHQ4bnRoX21mRXZMV005VUE4Qmt5UmFoUWNxWkYwN1A1Tk5fdjlFUENmSHRsQTdYLVYzMG00TWZtR3J1UHR5QVRWby11VnlCNWVLbjBjNVBsQ2NIUEFhUTdkQklTNXJUQVo0Rm5tQV9uajdaZmZYaE53?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOWHRVYm5xZElLMHQ4bnRoX21mRXZMV005VUE4Qmt5UmFoUWNxWkYwN1A1Tk5fdjlFUENmSHRsQTdYLVYzMG00TWZtR3J1UHR5QVRWby11VnlCNWVLbjBjNVBsQ2NIUEFhUTdkQklTNXJUQVo0Rm5tQV9uajdaZmZYaE53?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How much has bird flu spread in WA?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSnoxaVBGS0VPS2NhY0hwejdFWE5Zb1hya0FXVTNBa1FNZ1A5c3ZaU0VoV0REaHdiaVNoVFFPY3dIOXB3UjdIUU03UnZsLVVJREhvc21zMV80WmVCZlpqQl9PeHVRemw3Q2ZsZlpuYjJ2SnVXQmhCbkU3NnhOdmFHdTY1TEJiRkhj?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What Does the Avian Flu Surge Mean for Your Bird Feeders?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;National Audubon Society&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNOERUdk9GMmxYN2pRSVJ1MFBobDVxVmhGVnpsR2FaaXZQOGlMQWdBb09NVG4tRE1iMm5kZVJieV9GUGJJOHRaM1ZXNlpDUWZmT1EyVkpWdkpFODFnNC1FeWN5T200SWowZ19UYUx2dnhINzZvWFV4bThWUU1ON0FZYUpkczcxd1ZTamFLclB5Q04?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;FAQ: What to know about bird flu in WA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPbDUxYXlWUWpfSVJZdTdzd1QxdzBwRGpIdDh1V095eVJTZFhIQ0ZfTW4zN0l0a3NyclJURWU0N1BFQklfOUYyMHhqZmxOMTVmVUJ6RU00M2lSUWxGSkNtNkxjQlhmMGxVNURzaHhhal9SUEVfRzNnZHZvQ2RHVndJV3NjNWUxeUVtTHFtZUZn?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;CDC Reports New Bird Flu Cases In Humans.

Researchers discovered that both a person’s genetic predisposition for ADHD and experiences of childhood maltreatment independently increase the likelihood of experiencing ADHD symptoms in adulthood. Furthermore, the study suggests that genetic factors that raise the risk of ADHD may also indirectly increase the risk of a child experiencing maltreatment. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02589-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a condition that affects both children and adults, making it difficult to concentrate, control impulsive behaviors, and manage hyperactivity. It is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning it stems from differences in brain development. People with ADHD may struggle with organization, following instructions, and sitting still. While ADHD often starts in childhood, for many individuals, the symptoms continue into adulthood, impacting their work, relationships, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that ADHD has a strong genetic component, meaning it tends to run in families. However, environmental factors, particularly negative childhood experiences, are also thought to play a significant role. Childhood maltreatment, which includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, is a serious global problem with wide-ranging negative consequences for a child’s development and later life. Previous research has shown a connection between childhood maltreatment and an increased risk of developing ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain a deeper understanding of this connection, researchers in Brazil decided to investigate how genetic predisposition and childhood maltreatment might interact to influence ADHD symptoms in adulthood. They wanted to explore if genes and environment act independently, or if they influence each other in complex ways. Specifically, they looked at two possibilities: gene-environment interaction and gene-environment correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene-environment interaction would mean that the effect of genes on ADHD risk is different depending on whether someone has experienced maltreatment or not. Gene-environment correlation suggests that genes may influence the environment a person experiences. This study is particularly important because most previous research in this area has been conducted in high-income countries, while the rates of childhood maltreatment are often higher in low- and middle-income countries like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from a long-term study that has been following a group of individuals born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, in 2004. This study, known as the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort, initially included nearly all babies born in the city that year. The participants have been examined at various ages throughout their lives. For this particular study, the researchers focused on data collected when the participants were 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 18, the young adults completed a self-report questionnaire called the Adult Self Report Scale for ADHD. This questionnaire asks about symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are typical of ADHD. Mothers or caregivers also completed a questionnaire called the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, reporting on their child’s behavior, including hyperactivity and inattention. Using both self-reports and reports from mothers provided a more comprehensive picture of ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess genetic predisposition for ADHD, the researchers used genetic information collected from saliva samples taken when the participants were 6 years old. They calculated an ADHD genetic score for each participant. This score, called a polygenic score, is based on the combined effect of many common genetic variations across the entire genome that have been linked to ADHD in large previous studies. A higher score indicates a greater genetic likelihood of developing ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood maltreatment was evaluated using the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale. This questionnaire was administered to mothers or caregivers when the children were 6 and 11 years old. It asks about parenting behaviors that could be considered physical and psychological maltreatment, such as yelling, shaking, or hitting a child. The researchers used the average maltreatment score from ages 6 and 11 to represent overall childhood maltreatment experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gathering all this data, the researchers used statistical methods to analyze the relationships between genetic scores, childhood maltreatment, and ADHD symptoms at age 18. They considered various factors that could influence ADHD, such as sex, skin color, birth weight, intelligence quotient, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal education, family income, household size, and maternal depression, to ensure their findings were not due to these other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed several important findings. First, the researchers confirmed that the ADHD genetic score was associated with ADHD symptoms in adulthood, as reported by both the young adults themselves and their mothers. This means that individuals with higher genetic scores were more likely to show ADHD symptoms at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they found that childhood maltreatment was also linked to ADHD symptoms in adulthood. Individuals who experienced more maltreatment in childhood, according to reports from their mothers or caregivers, were more likely to report ADHD symptoms themselves and were also rated as having more symptoms by their mothers at age 18. This was true for both overall maltreatment and specifically for psychological and physical aggression, including corporal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, and interestingly, the study found that the ADHD genetic score was also associated with childhood maltreatment scores. This suggests that children with a higher genetic predisposition for ADHD were more likely to experience maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the researchers conducted additional analyses to investigate the mechanism behind this link. They found that ADHD symptoms observed at age 6 appeared to act as a mediator between genetic predisposition and later maltreatment. In other words, children with a higher genetic risk for ADHD might exhibit more ADHD symptoms early in life, and these early symptoms might, in turn, increase the likelihood of experiencing maltreatment. This suggests what is known as an evocative gene-environment correlation, where a child’s genetic traits influence how others, like parents, behave towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study did not find evidence for gene-environment interaction. This means that the effect of genetic predisposition on ADHD symptoms was not significantly different for those who experienced maltreatment compared to those who did not. Genes and environment appeared to have independent effects on ADHD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged some limitations of their study. Although the Pelotas birth cohort is a valuable resource, some participants were lost to follow-up over time, which could introduce some bias. The measurement of maltreatment relied on reports from mothers or caregivers and only captured maltreatment at ages 6 and 11, potentially missing maltreatment at other times or reported by other individuals. Also, for ethical reasons, the study did not specifically investigate more severe forms of maltreatment, such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, genetic scores developed primarily in European populations may not be as accurate in predicting ADHD risk in diverse populations like those in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths, including its long-term prospective design, the use of validated questionnaires, and the inclusion of both self and mother reports of ADHD symptoms. The fact that the study was conducted in a middle-income country like Brazil, where rates of childhood adversity can be high, adds to the importance of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02589-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gene – maltreatment interplay in adult ADHD symptoms: main role of a gene–environment correlation effect in a Brazilian population longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Luciana Tovo-Rodrigues, Laísa Camerini, Thais Martins-Silva, Marina Xavier Carpena, Carolina Bonilla, Isabel Oliveira Oliveira, Cristiane Silvestre de Paula, Joseph Murray, Aluísio J.
