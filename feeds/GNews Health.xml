The deceased was a young adult, but Boo said health officials do not yet know how the person was infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The home had no evidence of mouse activity,” he said. “We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven’t identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person’s exposure to mice or their droppings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Deer mice are widespread in California's Eastern Sierra region, but Boo said their numbers are thought to be higher than normal this year, which could &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hantavirus-arizona-warn-spread-potentially-fatal-rcna162593" target="_blank"&gt;increase the risk of exposure to hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The latest death comes weeks after investigators revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officials-share-update-mystery-deaths-gene-hackman-wife-rcna195281" target="_blank"&gt;Betsy Arakawa, the wife of Gene Hackman&lt;/a&gt;, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Arakawa and Hackman were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Feb. 26.

The deceased was a young adult, but Boo said health officials do not yet know how the person was infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The home had no evidence of mouse activity,” he said. “We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven’t identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person’s exposure to mice or their droppings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Deer mice are widespread in California's Eastern Sierra region, but Boo said their numbers are thought to be higher than normal this year, which could &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hantavirus-arizona-warn-spread-potentially-fatal-rcna162593" target="_blank"&gt;increase the risk of exposure to hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The latest death comes weeks after investigators revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officials-share-update-mystery-deaths-gene-hackman-wife-rcna195281" target="_blank"&gt;Betsy Arakawa, the wife of Gene Hackman&lt;/a&gt;, died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Arakawa and Hackman were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Feb. 26. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, and an autopsy determined that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officials-share-update-mystery-deaths-gene-hackman-wife-rcna195281" target="_blank"&gt;actor’s cause of death&lt;/a&gt; was “hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributory factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cases of hantavirus are relatively rare but can be devastating.

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laureates Announced and Honored at Annual Breakthrough Prize Ceremony in Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 5, 2025 – Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt; – The Breakthrough Prize Foundation today announced the winners of the 2025 Breakthrough Prizes, honoring scientists driving remarkable discoveries in gene editing, human diseases, the fundamental particles of the Universe and its underlying mathematical principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize – popularly known as the “Oscars® of Science” – was created to celebrate the wonders of our scientific age by founding sponsors &lt;strong&gt;Sergey Brin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Priscilla Chan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Julia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Yuri Milner&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Anne Wojcicki&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Breakthrough Prizes of $3 million each were awarded in Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics, and Mathematics. In addition, the foundation announced eight early-career physicists and mathematicians are sharing six $100,000 New Horizons Prizes. Three women mathematicians recently completing PhDs are each receiving a $50,000 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize. This year’s prize money totals $18.75 million, bringing the amount conferred over the 14 years of the Breakthrough Prize to more than $326 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year’s Breakthrough Prize laureates have made amazing strides – including treatments for major diseases affecting millions of people worldwide – showing once again the transformative power of curiosity-driven basic science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The questions these laureates are asking are among the deepest questions there are – about the workings of life, the nature of the Universe and the abstract landscapes of mathematics. It’s inspiring to see scientists seeking and finding answers to these questions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Yuri Milner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The breakthroughs being recognized this year are extraordinary – including, in my own field, amazing gene-editing technologies that are already having a big impact. I’m excited to learn more about the scientists’ ideas across all the fields.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Anne Wojcicki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel J. Drucker&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Joel Habener&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jens Juul Holst&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lotte Bjerre Knudsen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Svetlana Mojsov&lt;/strong&gt; share the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. These five scientists' complementary contributions – from basic hormone discovery through physiological understanding to pharmaceutical development – have led to highly effective drugs for diabetes and obesity, ushering in a new era of &lt;strong&gt;GLP-1&lt;/strong&gt; medicines for cardiometabolic disorders. Between them their breakthroughs include: the discovery of the gene encoding the GLP-1 hormone; the synthesis, isolation and characterization of the hormone’s biologically active forms; the demonstration that it is produced in the gut and stimulates insulin production; elucidation of its broader physiological roles, including control of appetite and energy homeostasis; the development of a more stable version of the hormone that continues to act in the body for days rather than hours; and its translation into a new class of drugs that is transforming the treatment of metabolic diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen L. Hauser&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alberto Ascherio&lt;/strong&gt; share the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. The two researchers have transformed the understanding and treatment of &lt;strong&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt; (MS), a debilitating neurodegenerative disease in which the immune system attacks the insulating protein around nerve fibers. Among other contributions, Hauser overturned the scientific consensus on the mechanism of MS, identifying the immune system’s B cells as the primary driver of damage to nerve cells. He was also instrumental in the development and testing of B cell-depleting therapies, which have revolutionized modern treatment of the disease. Meanwhile, through painstaking long-term epidemiological analysis, Ascherio discovered the necessary condition for getting MS: infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of the population carries this pathogen, normally without severe effects, but Ascherio showed that contracting it raises the risk of developing MS by a factor of 32. This work opens the possibility of treating MS with antiviral drugs, and for the development of a vaccine for EBV that could effectively prevent MS altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David R. Liu&lt;/strong&gt; is awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for developing two powerful, widely used &lt;strong&gt;gene-editing&lt;/strong&gt; technologies. These technologies are engineered molecular machines that correct mutations in our DNA that cause genetic diseases in patients. Importantly, they do not require cutting the DNA double-helix, and thus lead to fewer unwanted outcomes. In 2016 Liu’s lab developed base editing, which corrects the single-letter “misspellings” that constitute about 30 percent of mutations known to cause genetic diseases. Then in 2019 his lab invented prime editing, which replaces whole stretches of defective DNA with a corrected version, and in principle could be used to repair nearly all disease-causing mutations. These technologies have already been distributed more than 20,000 times to labs around the world, resulting in thousands of published advances in research, agriculture, and biomedicine. In animals, base editing and prime editing have successfully corrected mutations to rescue blood diseases such as sickle-cell disease and beta-thalassemia, neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathies, genetic forms of blindness, genetic forms of hearing loss, several metabolic disorders, and progeria, a premature aging disease. At least 15 base editing and prime editing clinical trials have begun in five countries, with beneficial and, in some cases, life-saving results already confirmed in patients for the treatment of T-cell leukemia, sickle-cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fundamental Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics is awarded to thousands of researchers from more than 70 countries representing four experimental collaborations at &lt;strong&gt;CERN&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/strong&gt; (LHC) – &lt;strong&gt;ATLAS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CMS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ALICE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LHCb&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3 million prize is allocated to ATLAS ($1 million); CMS ($1 million), ALICE ($500,000) and LHCb ($500,000), in recognition of &lt;strong&gt;13,508&lt;/strong&gt; co-authors of publications based on LHC Run-2 data released between 2015 and July 15, 2024. [ATLAS – 5,345 researchers; CMS – 4,550; ALICE – 1,869; LHCb – 1,744].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consultation with the leaders of the experiments, the Breakthrough Prize Foundation will donate 100 percent of the prize funds to the &lt;strong&gt;CERN &amp;amp; Society Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. The prize money will be used by the collaborations to offer grants for doctoral students from member institutes to spend research time at CERN, giving the students experience working at the forefront of science and new expertise to bring back to their home countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four experiments are recognized for testing the modern theory of particle physics – the Standard Model – and other theories describing physics that might lie beyond it to high precision. This includes precisely measuring properties of the Higgs boson and elucidating the mechanism by which the Higgs field gives mass to elementary particles; probing extremely rare particle interactions, and exotic states of matter that existed in the first moments of the Universe; discovering more than 72 new hadrons and measuring subtle differences between matter and antimatter particles; and setting strong bounds on possibilities for new physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter, supersymmetry and hidden extra dimensions. ATLAS and CMS are general-purpose experiments, which pursue the full program of exploration offered by the LHC’s high-energy and high-intensity proton and ion beams. They synchronously announced the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 and continue to investigate its properties. ALICE studies the quark-gluon plasma, a state of extremely hot and dense matter that existed in the first microseconds after the Big Bang. And LHCb explores minute differences between matter and antimatter, violation of fundamental symmetries, and the complex spectra of composite particles (“hadrons”) made of heavy and light quarks. By performing these extraordinarily precise and delicate tests, the LHC experiments have pushed the boundaries of fundamental physics to unprecedented limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis Gaitsgory&lt;/strong&gt; wins the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics for his central role in the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture. The &lt;strong&gt;Langlands program&lt;/strong&gt; is a broad research program spanning several fields of mathematics. It grew out of a series of conjectures proposing precise connections between seemingly disparate mathematical concepts. Such connections are powerful tools; for example, the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem reduces to a particular instance of the Langlands conjecture. These Langlands program equivalences can be thought of as generalizations of the Fourier transform, a tool that relates waves to frequency spectrums and has widespread uses from seismology to sound engineering. In the case of the geometric Langlands conjecture, the proposed one-to-one correspondence is between two very different sets of objects, analogous to these spectrums and waves: on the spectrum side are abstract algebraic objects called representations of the fundamental group, which capture information about the kinds of loop that can wrap around certain complex surfaces; on the “wave” side are sheaves, which, loosely speaking, are rules assigning vector spaces to points on a surface. Gaitsgory has dedicated much of the last 30 years to the geometric Langlands conjecture. In 2013 he wrote an outline of the steps required for a proof, and after more than a decade of intensive research in 2024 he and his colleagues published the full proof, comprising over 800 pages spread over 5 papers. This is a monumental advance, expected to have deep implications in other areas of mathematics too, including number theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gerard 't Hooft&lt;/strong&gt;, winner of the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, is one of the world’s most pre-eminent theoretical physicists. In the early 1970s he made crucial contributions to the foundations of what would later become known as the Standard Model of the subatomic particles. He proved that Yang-Mills theories (the mathematical framework underlying theories of both the weak and strong nuclear forces) make sense when treated quantum mechanically – that they can give finite, calculable results rather than meaningless infinities – thus validating theories which became central to the Standard Model. He made several crucial contributions to understanding the theory of the strong force, including resolving a major problem involving the masses of particles through special field configurations called instantons; he developed new mathematical tools for studying strongly interacting quarks; and he introduced the fruitful approach of studying the strong force by imagining it is mediated by many more varieties of quarks and gluons than it actually is. These and other contributions helped establish the Standard Model as a workable theory and provided powerful tools for calculating its predictions. 't Hooft has studied the quantum effects that can explain how information is processed in black holes, which led to the development of the holographic principle in cosmology, and possibly to new alternative ways to interpret quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Horizons in Physics Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s New Horizons in Physics Prizes honor early-career researchers across a wide range of fields. In atomic physics, &lt;strong&gt;Waseem Bakr&lt;/strong&gt; has created quantum gas microscopes that can image individual atoms confined in an optical lattice, advancing the study of strongly interacting quantum systems. In quantum information, a field at the fertile intersection of physics, mathematics and computer science, &lt;strong&gt;Jeongwan Haah&lt;/strong&gt; has developed models of emergent quantum systems –macroscopic systems exhibiting quantum behavior, whose potential applications include quantum computing; these models include ‘Haah's code’, which has opened the field of a class of quasi-particles called fractons. And in astronomy, &lt;strong&gt;Sebastiaan Haffert&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Jensen-Clem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Maaike van Kooten&lt;/strong&gt; have designed and enabled novel techniques for extreme adaptive optics, which are systems that compensate for the effects of Earth’s atmosphere on light reaching terrestrial telescopes. Their work promises to enable the direct detection of the smallest exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Horizons in Mathematics Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern physics and higher mathematics share intimate connections, and it is notable that the research areas of all three of this year’s New Horizons in Mathematics Prize winners have links to quantum physics. &lt;strong&gt;Ewain Gwynne&lt;/strong&gt; is recognized for his work in conformal probability, which studies probabilistic objects such as random curves and surfaces. &lt;strong&gt;John Pardon&lt;/strong&gt; has produced a number of important results in geometry and topology, particularly in the field of symplectic geometry and pseudo-holomorphic curves, which are certain types of smooth surfaces in manifolds. &lt;strong&gt;Sam Raskin&lt;/strong&gt; has played a significant role in the major recent progress on the geometric Langlands program (see Mathematics section above), including the final proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture in characteristic 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize is awarded to outstanding women mathematicians who have recently completed their PhDs. &lt;strong&gt;Si Ying Lee&lt;/strong&gt; has found a new approach to an important problem in the Langlands program (see Mathematics section above), succeeding in reducing it to a local problem. &lt;strong&gt;Rajula Srivastava&lt;/strong&gt; has made progress in a challenging area at the intersection of harmonic analysis and number theory. Her work focuses on bounding the number of lattice points one can find near a given smooth surface, with important applications to Diophantine approximation in higher dimensions. &lt;strong&gt;Ewin Tang&lt;/strong&gt; has invented quantum computing algorithms for machine learning. She also proved that certain calculations, which quantum algorithms were widely considered to be exponentially faster at solving, can actually be solved in comparable time by a normal (non-quantum) computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About The Breakthrough Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year, the Breakthrough Prize, renowned as the “Oscars® of Science,” recognizes the world’s top scientists. Each prize is $3 million and presented in the fields of Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics and Mathematics. In addition, up to three New Horizons in Physics Prizes, up to three New Horizons in Mathematics Prizes and up to three Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes are given out to early-career researchers each year. Laureates attend a gala award ceremony designed to celebrate their achievements and inspire the next generation of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prizes were founded by Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, Julia and Yuri Milner, and Anne Wojcicki and have been sponsored by foundations established by them. Selection Committees composed of previous Breakthrough Prize laureates in each field choose the winners. Information on the Breakthrough Prize is available at &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org"&gt;breakthroughprize.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Two of those have the most common, benign type — &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20355643#:~:text=Most%20meningiomas%20grow%20very%20slowly,may%20be%20watched%20over%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meningioma&lt;/a&gt; — according to the hospital, which is located about 10 miles west of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital not provide specifics regarding the conditions of the other six staffers, saying only that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/5-nurses-work-floor-massachusetts-hospital-brain-tumors-rcna199798" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;they suffered from unspecified health issues&lt;/a&gt;, NBC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the cluster, the Newton hospital launched an investigation “in collaboration with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety,” but did not uncover any “environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,” Jonathan Sonis, the hospital’s associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement to the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe ruled out the water supply, disposable masks, nearby X-rays and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below as potential triggers, the hospital added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors,” the statement continued. “As always, the health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our absolute top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.massnurses.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association&lt;/a&gt; has taken issue with the conclusion, claiming the hospital’s review of the environmental factors was “not comprehensive,” NBC Boston reported. The union added that it has begun looking into the matter on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hospital&lt;a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/5-nurses-in-1-unit-at-newton-wellesley-hospital-diagnosed-with-brain-tumors/3676081/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; cannot make this issue go away&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to provide a predetermined conclusion,” MNA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

After reconnecting with her old acquaintance, Victoria decided a word of warning might be useful for her fellow stranded passenger at Gate 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Be careful handling the measles outbreak,” she cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Probably tired of batting away the chicken goujons at Mar-a-Lago, America’s health chief forgot all the glossy spin that got him through the confirmation process and shrugged.

Iron. Calcium. At the peak of my illness with Lyme disease, my mother doled out more than 20 supplements a day, which I had to choke down with the meager meals I could force myself to eat. I wasn’t just suffering from typical Lyme disease symptoms—the bacteria that causes the infection had spread to my central nervous system, causing what is called neurological Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeing a Lyme specialist and a neurologist, I regularly saw a naturopath who prescribed the boatload of supplements that he assured us would help me to walk again and recover my flagging cognitive function. But it turns out that megadosing me on vitamins I was already getting from food may have been making me sicker than I already was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was more than 20 years ago. Today, the science of supplements has been more carefully examined. With hindsight on my side, I wondered—was it my Lyme disease, the excessive supplementation or a combination thereof that kept me totally disabled for almost seven years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, not everyone can relate to the extent of my experience. And while most people aren’t taking 20 supplements daily, I wouldn't be surprised if some come close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are inundated with talk of dietary supplements daily. Maybe it’s products being hawked by a peppy wellness influencer in your social feed, or on the ad break during your favorite podcast. Or perhaps family or friends bring up the supposed latest and greatest supplement during dinner. The idea that healthy eating isn’t enough is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can supplements be helpful when used appropriately, or should I toss the few that I still keep in my cupboard and instead stick to a balanced diet to get the nutrients my body needs? And what does science say are the real dangers of taking too many supplements? I talked to a medical toxicologist, a hepatologist (liver specialist) and a dietitian to understand more, and to avoid further pitfalls of the booming yet unchecked supplement industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Supplements and Their Role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly qualifies as a dietary supplement? In essence, it’s anything you ingest that isn’t food or medication. According to the Food and Drug Administration, supplements can include vitamins, including elemental ones like A, B, C and D; botanicals or herbs, elderberry or ginger, botanical compounds (think &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8036275/greens-powder-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:green powders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;green powders&lt;/a&gt;); minerals, such as calcium and magnesium; and even live microbials, usually referred to as “probiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re looking and thinking about supplementation, it’s to enhance the diet; so if there is a true deficiency, then supplementation would be warranted. It should not replace having a healthy diet,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-czerwony-a879b629a/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beth Czerwony, M.S., RD, CSOWM, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Beth Czerwony, M.S., RD, CSOWM, LD&lt;/a&gt;, an outpatient dietitian for the Center for Human Nutrition at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, nutritional supplements cannot and should not replace meals, or for that matter, medicines. Their name says it all. However, &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/david-victor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David W. Victor III, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David W. Victor III, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the interim chief of hepatology at Houston Methodist in Texas, says not to discount their power: “Every supplement can be considered in some way a drug because it is a substance taken for a therapeutic purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor explains that, just like food or medicine, supplements are broken down in the digestive tract and absorbed into the bloodstream, which transports them to the appropriate tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons that people take supplements are as varied as our bodies themselves. I did it to potentially fill in dietary gaps, as well as to try to improve my ill health. It’s common to take vitamin C or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/echinacea-benefits-8773248" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:echinacea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;echinacea&lt;/a&gt; with the expectation of supporting immunity during cold and flu season. Others might turn to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-b12-benefits-8676211" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; with the hope that it will boost energy levels or help improve workouts. The common factor is that consumers are seeking something they believe they can’t get from food or from the medications prescribed by their doctors. And the trend is only growing, with 1 in 3 adults in the United States and Europe taking at least one supplement per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under current laws, as laid out by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994, part of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has no authority over dietary supplements, meaning it doesn’t regulate them. Instead, it’s up to supplement companies to provide oversight and ensure the safety of their products, which comes with some risks. For instance, a supplement may not contain what it says it does, or may contain an ingredient that isn’t listed. Even more so, anyone could sell a supplement without proving its effectiveness. However, if the FDA deems a supplement on the marketplace to be unsafe, it can request that the company recall the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Dangers of Too Many Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some supplements can be dangerous due to drug interactions or because of a person’s underlying health problems, usually, their toxicity lies in taking too many of them. As &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/john-downs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John W. Downs, M.D., M.P.H., FACP, FACOEM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;John W. Downs, M.D., M.P.H., FACP, FACOEM&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Virginia Poison Center at VCU Health in Virginia, puts it, “Just like with all medications, it is important to recognize that more isn’t always better. Excessive intake of certain vitamins and nutritional supplements can be just as harmful as taking medications in excess of the prescribed doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supplements that can be toxic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supplements that can be toxic&lt;/a&gt; when you take too much of them aren’t just obscure ingredients. Downs says that they include the basics. For example, a high dose of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; could cause liver damage or increased pressure on the brain. Many of us don’t get enough vitamin D from food, and it’s estimated that around 40% of the U.S. population may have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D insufficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D insufficiency&lt;/a&gt;. But taking too much can lead to elevated serum calcium concentrations, which can cause kidney dysfunction and mental status changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A and vitamin D are both fat-soluble. Czerwony says that means your body stores them in fat cells, rather than getting rid of them through urination, as with water-soluble ones (including most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:B vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin C). Fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in fat stores over time and result in “super-high levels and side effects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Victor deals with the liver every day, he’s especially well-positioned to have seen which supplements can wreak havoc. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-benefits-8785974" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;turmeric supplements&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to be pretty safe in the short term for most people, he mentions this supplement and its active compound, curcumin, have caused liver damage in some people at doses as low as 500 milligrams daily (the lowest dose commonly found in turmeric supplements). It’s important to note that turmeric supplements contain much higher concentrations of curcumin compared to the spice per se. Plus, curcumin in food is much less bioavailable (how much is absorbed and used by your body) compared to the supplement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is green tea. Green tea extract, reputed for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/green-tea-and-antioxidant-absorption-8649839" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:its antioxidant properties;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;its antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;, may also cause injury to the liver when taken in excess, he notes. An excessive dose of green tea extract seems to be over 800 mg per day (or drinking 24 cups of green tea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is also important to note that nutritional supplements sometimes contain unexpected ingredients which may also contribute to adverse health effects,” adds Downs. Reading labels carefully can help with this, but going back to the lack of FDA regulation, it’s also important to be judicious with which supplements you choose. Even more important? Working with your primary health care provider, who can not only tell you of any potential issues but also monitor how your supplements affect your body with blood work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my years of over-supplementing, I often couldn’t keep food down. Czerwony suggests that this might have been a symptom of my excessive consumption. “Most often, it’s going to be things like nausea or vomiting,” she explains. “Some people end up having diarrhea and headaches, and depending on whether they’re [taking] a fat-soluble vitamin, it could take some time to come on. It takes a little bit more time to accumulate in your system.” Gastrointestinal distress and headaches are the most common symptoms of chronic toxicity, but symptoms can vary from supplement to supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if you take prescription medications? Our experts all agreed that there can be potentially catastrophic interactions. “St. John’s wort is known to interact with some of the enzymes in the liver, changing the concentration of many medicines in the body, so it should be used with great caution,” says Victor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“St. John’s wort can also interact with other medications for depression, leading to a potentially life-threatening condition called serotonin toxicity,” adds Downs. Some symptoms of serotonin syndrome (or serotonin toxicity) include agitation, tachycardia and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Czerwony points out that St. John’s wort can also decrease the efficacy of antibiotics, a trait it shares with many other supplements, including magnesium, calcium, iron and vitamins A, C and D. And antibiotics aren’t the only medications that can be weakened with supplements. She also mentions that she’s seen cancer patients who try to power up their immunity with supplements, only to counteract the effects of their chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Safely Take Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing as safe supplement use? Yes, but it should take place under a doctor’s care. Here are some tips to do it safely:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose supplements that have been independently verified: &lt;/strong&gt;Downs recommends making sure that your supplements come from reputable sources and that you check with your doctor or registered dietitian about the right dosage for you. As mentioned above, the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements nor verify that what they claim is true. That’s why it’s important to “Look for labels with the NSF or USP certification logos, which indicate that the supplement has undergone an independent review for quality control and consistency. And as always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” he cautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get bloodwork done when you start a new supplement: &lt;/strong&gt;“You can monitor the effect of a supplement on the liver by checking labs,” says Victor, who recommends doing blood work a month to 12 weeks after starting a new supplement. “Patients should be open with their doctor about what supplements they’re taking so that we can all make sure that we are aware of what could be causing liver inflammation,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware of available resources:&lt;/strong&gt; The National Institutes of Health maintains a website, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547852/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LiverTox;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LiverTox&lt;/a&gt;, that allows patients to check the toxicity of their supplements. You can also reach your local certified poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 to discuss potential drug-and-supplement interactions, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used correctly and under the oversight of a medical professional, nutritional supplements can be an integral enhancement to a balanced diet. For example, the depression that made my illness even more difficult to treat may have been improved with a safe, balanced vitamin D regimen. But taking more than 20 supplements a day was not the answer, especially when several of the ones I took likely lessened the efficacy of my antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supplementation should never replace a healthy diet; it’s just to enhance it,” says Czerwony. “You should not feel like you can just eat whatever you want and then just take a bunch of supplements and think that you’re going to be OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all in the name—supplements are just that: something to supplement (or fill gaps) and build upon a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/too-many-supplements-11708988" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 17:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5HdXVDaGhFdTlwb1ZfaFVlN0VPZXlBTHhkZVZNc0VTVjhiSGt6Ri1OUjhVVHlNM2NhSXBSX1ZQMUxqdFEtakZEQmZNcGNNXzI3bEFJcTNSMGJfVWhpcG03a045TUZpUHBpM28zMm5GUFpoSjA</guid></item><item><title>Does Added Protein Really Enhance The Nutrition of Your Food? - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQa2ZIS1AwZ2tBWF9LYXpkbU1USl9sTHJQS0dLRVA5LUJNVm1BNldvVmNfTWEyNms3X2pzRFNKa1I4VGhuUzJvNlhNTmlXVjBQUjR2M0J1Z3BZelF0SjM2b2xLS2ZYYVV4R3E1elRZVjNKMlBjTzhjamYzQjh0aDVhQVJnVExpYUFVMDhpVy0zY2dsR3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Protein intake dominates fitness advice. Whether you want to build muscle, improve your fitness or watch your weight, the common advice handed out by everyone from fitness influencers to doctors is that we need more protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while protein does play an essential role in maintaining our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38840697/"&gt;muscle mass and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, all this increased attention on the importance of protein &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/high-protein-food-diet-recipes-dr-rupy-aujla-b2720439.html"&gt;in the media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a754243/how-much-protein-should-i-eat-to-build-muscle/"&gt;fitness circles&lt;/a&gt; has sparked a surge in products marketed specifically for their protein content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some chocolate bars, ice cream, pizza,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, and even alcoholic beverages now &lt;a href="https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/97003-protein-flexes-its-muscles-as-consumers-look-to-add-more-protein-to-diet"&gt;market themselves as protein foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our enthusiasm for protein might have gone too far. While protein is certainly important for our health, most of us don't need these protein-enhanced foods as a regular feature in our diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that this marketing may lead to a '&lt;a href="https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(19)30614-1/pdf"&gt;halo effect&lt;/a&gt;', where consumers mistakenly equate high protein content with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1139"&gt;overall nutritional value&lt;/a&gt;. This effect can lead to the perception of protein-rich foods being inherently nutritious – even though many may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(24)00176-1/abstract"&gt;maintaining muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259402/"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrition guidelines recommend people aim to eat &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coma-reports"&gt;around 0.75 g of protein&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of body weight. But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11329409/"&gt;some evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; this recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723001446?via%3Dihub"&gt;may be an underestimate&lt;/a&gt; – and that the recommendation should be around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960445/"&gt;1.2 g-1.6 g per kg of body weight per day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong body of evidence that suggests the amount of protein we need changes depending on our health. For instance, people need to eat more protein when they're &lt;a href="https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03693-4"&gt;recovering from an illness&lt;/a&gt;. Research also shows that &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(13)00326-5/fulltext"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; should be aiming for at least 1.2 g per kg of body weight in order to combat &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/78/Supplement_1/67/7199271"&gt;age-related muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes also need to eat a greater amount of protein to &lt;a href="https://origin.health.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2014-june_elevate_health.pdf"&gt;support their training and recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, with the rising popularity of weight-loss drugs, strategies increasingly emphasise protein intake to &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/73/Supplement_1/14-PUB/156089/14-PUB-The-Effect-of-Structured-Intensive"&gt;minimise muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; while losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just because protein is good for maintaining muscle mass, that doesn't mean more is better. In fact, it seems that even when we &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5828430/"&gt;consume large amounts of protein&lt;/a&gt;, only a some of this is actually used by the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us probably need a little more protein than current guidelines suggest, but less than is often promoted by wellness influencers on social media (with some even suggesting we need up to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/wolfcoach_/reel/DCUyAeJIH7K/"&gt;3 g of protein per kg of body weight&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the necessary amount of protein suggested by emerging evidence (&lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/apnm-2020-0760"&gt;1.2 g -1.6 g&lt;/a&gt; per kg of body weight per day) is close to what the &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/key-findings-from-ndns-report-for-years-9-to-11-combined/"&gt;average protein consumption already is&lt;/a&gt; in most western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can probably benefit from being more protein aware – not about how much protein they're consuming, but about the quality and frequency of their protein choices. Ideally, we should aim to consume small amounts of protein-rich foods more often during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current evidence suggests around &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;20 g-30 g of protein&lt;/a&gt; (around a handful of a protein source) at each meal supports muscle maintenance alongside physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, this protein would come from whole foods (such as nuts, seeds, milk, eggs and legumes). But fortified protein products may have their space as a quick and easy snack – especially for those who may struggle to eat this much protein at each meal. It's important to eat these foods in moderation, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are full of "protein-enhanced" products. But while these products may contain additional protein, they may also contain additional sugars or carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, protein milk often contains &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/high-protein-milk-its-not-just-milk-added-protein-powder"&gt;double the protein&lt;/a&gt; of regular milk. It does this by removing water or adding dried milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein bars are another example. But depending on the brand you choose, alongside their additional protein content they may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/well/eat/protein-bars.html"&gt;high in sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many protein-fortified products share another common trait: they fall into the category of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-protein-powder-protein-shake-110306908.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIBi1_2t4Yd7wU45o2XrHxyD3cJNSkbxNZ_oKTdMcEmMGC-MTxQOhxAsaKJSedLMG7HhWzJp44aL6nf0UFQwqoevTnMz3JF3uBDhvzwjK6-ACOpIQi4lAkxQFfVHeQ9uMRkmXRTr_O-RCsOAGHpUbIMBm8yZ940rt5vVk1w4_nuA"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/position-statement-on-the-concept-of-ultra-processed-foods-upf"&gt;commercially made products&lt;/a&gt; that include ingredients you wouldn't typically find in your own kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows regularly consuming ultra-processed foods is consistently linked with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363072/"&gt;poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; – such as cardiovascular diseases and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Current discussions around ultra-processed foods suggests uncertainty regarding whether it's the processing itself, the poor nutritional quality of these foods or the combination of both of these factors that contribute to these negative health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue with protein-enhanced products is that while they do indeed contain extra protein, some products &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-scoop-on-protein-powder-2020030918986"&gt;may lack fibre&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="157246" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and essential minerals. A &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(23)00363-1/abstract"&gt;lack of fibre&lt;/a&gt; in modern diets is currently one of the biggest contributors to population-wide ill-health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All foods have their place within a balanced diet. But protein is only one component of overall nutritional health. The rise in protein-fortified foods as health foods is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein-enhanced products are occasional foods that might support meeting protein intake, but they should not be mistaken for universally healthy foods. For people looking to reach their protein goals, choose a variety of protein sources, consider the role of convenience foods within the context of whole diet and think about other nutrients like fibre to really maximise health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252236/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That’s when things started to get weird.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm931aohy002q3b72fcjuabgb@published"&gt;Amazingly, he felt well enough after about 10 minutes to get back to work (he works from home due to his migraine issue). The thing is, now he wants a blow job every time a migraine strikes. Based on his reaction it actually does seem to alleviate his symptoms! The trouble is that he’s been having migraines and requiring my “help” at least three times a day lately. Is there any medical basis for this, or could he be taking advantage of the situation?&lt;br&gt;—An Unlikely Cure&lt;/p&gt;

To put it more bluntly: Why can’t this guy jerk off to relieve his pain? Has he given you an answer for this? Have you asked?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9318vs0001l3b7203m1dcwi@published"&gt;To be clear, there is data suggesting that sexual activity may actually alleviate his migraines and/or the pain associated with them. A 2013 &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0333102413476374"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cephalalgia&lt;/em&gt; found that 60 percent of survey responders who had experienced sexual activity during a migraine reported that their migraines improved in seeming response. Here “sexual activity” referred to “any sexual intercourse or masturbation with the aim of reaching an orgasm or an orgasm-like feeling.” The study is clear: “the kind of sexual activity did not seem to have any influence on the particular reaction” and “the primary headache associated with sexual activity appears to be independent of the specific sexual methods, e.g. while masturbating.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9318vvu001m3b72p2dosjub@published"&gt;This is why I wonder whether he has even tested whether masturbating would serve the same function as your blow jobs. Something tells me no, and that he’s effectively gilding the lily here. Perhaps he has been honest about the pain relief and less so about the necessary means. Incidentally, the study uncovered that men respond to this kind of relief particularly well (73.3 reported sexual activity marking improvement or stopping the migraine attack altogether versus 58 percent of women responders). The study authors postulated that the analgesic effect of sex on migraines may have something to do with the release of endorphins or mere distraction from pain.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t help but be jealous about this—it drives me crazy to think about her being with other people. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/12/girlfriend-sexual-tricks-boyfriends-sex-advice.html"&gt;How can I handle these feelings?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than simply responding to pleasure or pain, serotonin appears to encode a “prospective value” signal—telling the brain how good the near future is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using reinforcement learning models and neural recordings from serotonin-rich regions, researchers found these neurons respond most to unexpected rewards. This insight sheds new light on the complex role of serotonin in decision-making, learning, and emotion, potentially changing how we understand mood disorders and mental health treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospective Value Code:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons encode expected future rewards, not just pleasure or pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons are especially activated by unexpected rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could reshape understanding of decision-making and mental health treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our day-to-day lives, we’re constantly making a slew of decisions from immediate matters to prospects on the far horizon. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evolutionary nuts-and-bolts of how our brains weigh these numerous daily decisions and what role is played by the neurotransmitter serotonin has been shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108403"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-prediction-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study led by an interdisciplinary uOttawa Faculty of Medicine team delivers fascinating findings on this big topic and potentially unravels a hidden aspect of what our nervous system’s extraordinarily complex serotonin system is really doing inside the enigmatic organ in our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, this study from a highly impactful international collaboration was considered by one of the expert reviewers who evaluated the work to offer “broad implications across neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, enhancing our understanding of serotonin’s role in mood regulation, learning, and motivated behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s innovative work merges ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) theory – used in neuroscience to better understand learning, behavior, and decision-making – with recent hard-won insights into the filtering properties of the brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus. That’s a region of the mammalian brainstem rich in serotonin-producing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is often painted as the brain’s “pleasure chemical.” Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) famously target the serotonin system as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, serotonin’s precise role in the nervous system is ambiguous and perplexing: It’s implicated in everything from mood and movement regulation to appetite and sleep-wake cycles. The fact that it’s activated by pain, pleasure and surprise has long been a brain research puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, the uOttawa-led researchers put forth a unifying perspective on serotonin they dub a “prospective code for value” – a biological code for how the brain places a value for future rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code essentially explains why serotonin neurons are activated in the brain in response to both rewards and punishments, with a preference for surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work asks the question: What does serotonin tell the brain? In a nutshell, we find that its message closely matches the expectation of future rewards,” says senior author Dr. Richard Naud, associate professor at the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicineand the uOttawa Department of Physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, puts the main findings like this: “Your brain needs to compute the expected value of the actions you contemplate and undertake as you interact with a changing world, asking ‘What’s the value of this decision versus that decision in that particular environment?’ That’s a hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So what we think serotonin actually does in the brain is encode the expected value of a particular environment or course of actions in order to ultimately guide everyday decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs. Béïque and Naud are both members of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en/gazette-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Richard Naud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en/gazette-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Richard Naud – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08731-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;” by Richard Naud et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons to emotionally salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centring on reward, surprise, salience and uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

Cosmetic surgery is "more normalised", she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting "fatigue" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;And the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too.

Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they "can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret," Prof Frame said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 14:43:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE10aTQ5bXdRX3ZFOXJhNlRQU21jLURBZjNwRXB1OUpYNzRNaDFlUG1tV2QwVldYMWpnVGcwV3NhSDJtclZ6X3RpZC1fZ3gtWGVsMktWaUFZbkUzQdIBX0FVX3lxTE0wVnYySEhyc01VeVdoZjZidHdObzBKSDNGUUdBTndoUWhmV0JuRmEwQ2hqRm5wRTY0S2t0aE1VTGZGN29PVk15MVpmeDNzempiRkNSbnI0TDZSdkhwS3g0</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.'s measles 'cure' sickens Texas kids amid outbreak - DW</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOeGVTOFZ4UUEtQVFpTWdEUkhsbVBQZnRiVFBkZHp2UXZ3NFNMYktEc1dUWE5qb1BFSGlxdkE3RDFQQ19VWGQ2cFRldC1DRWN1T2pfOVBydUhWbmhkMHhKYzVvQ3o2V25aa0RRUm9JeUhJSkQ5Q1BwUlpDck12ZnlPTGZsMWp2eVVveDVBR0l5Y9IBjwFBVV95cUxOVGtLbHBnT21DQXIwRk54THFvYTdxN1FLV2EzMDJKb1pGNm44UFlCVnZCNDh2dXlVdERCUlVDWnk4UlNNS05aVjZyMHFRVEpiVV9qMXhETGpiRFpXSnBTVGgyUnFkdlV3amxpblMwaEhkeG42VW9KVEFVM015OHFfZHVmUWs0aGhEYWtubEtCZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cc0m0op s1ebneao rich-text t1it8i9i r1wgtjne wgx1hx2 b1ho1h07"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article may be potentially distressing to parents with children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West Texas has been gripped by a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles/t-62853301"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreak for the past several weeks and as a result of misinformation passed on by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., it now faces a second, related health problem: Vitamin A toxicity — or hypervitaminosis A — in infants and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation appears to be the direct result of bogus medical information pedaled by the vaccine-skeptic secretary himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently said that although the measles vaccine is the best defense against the highly contagious and potentially fatal infection, he emphasized that getting inoculated was a "personal choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, whom President Donald Trump appointed to be the nation's top health advisor, suggested, "vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality," or even prevent measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently directed the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to update measles guidance to promote vitamin A use in fighting the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March, the CDC's top communications officer, Thomas Corry, cited Kennedy's slow response to the West Texas outbreak and his embrace of so-called "alternative measles treatment," as the reason for his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous other CDC and HHS officials have resigned since Kennedy took over, more health workers still —so far at least 10,000 — have also fallen prey to Elon Musk's cost-cutting measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, HHS has lost a quarter of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="72149000" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/72149000_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A headshot of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on February 13, 2025 "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, has pedaled debunked medical information for years, now his advice appears to be hurting children in Texas (FILE: February 13, 2025)&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Laura Brett/picture alliance &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;West Texas anti-vax parents making their kids sick on Kennedy's bad advice?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Kennedy and the CDC suggest vitamin A should only be taken under doctor's supervision, West Texas parents are apparently giving their children so much of it that they are now being admitted to hospital emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other remedies, Kennedy has claimed that cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamins A and D, "works" as a treatment against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although vitamin A may be given to measles patients who suffer malnutrition-related vitamin A deficiencies, there is no evidence suggesting that it is effective in preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though it is known that excessive cod liver oil consumption can have serious negative health consequences, demand for it has exploded in West Texas, with pharmacies saying, "it's flying off the shelf."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, has said it has treated "fewer than 10 cases" of vitamin A toxicity over the past couple of weeks. Administrators say the children were initially admitted with measles symptoms but later determined to have had abnormally functioning livers as a result of vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Covenant are publicly warning against excessive vitamin A intake, saying that it could lead to severe side effects such as dry skin, impaired sight, bone problems and liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines the only proven prevention against measles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) on Friday said that it had &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles-in-texas-a-deadly-disease-that-can-be-prevented/a-68121991"&gt;recorded 481 cases of measles since January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" title="External link — The number of nationwide measles cases stood at 607 as of April 4, according to the CDC."&gt; The number of nationwide measles cases stood at 607 as of April 4, according to the CDC.&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles — a highly contagious respiratory &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;infection that spreads&lt;/a&gt; when an infected individual sneezes, coughs or speaks, as well as when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after contact with a contaminated surface — was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 thanks to decades of sustained mass-vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/why-measles-is-so-deadly-and-vaccination-so-important/a-47743349"&gt;only effectively proven method of preventing measles is the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which boasts 97% efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, the Texas DSHS confirmed the death of a "school-age child who was not vaccinated" and who had "tested positive for measles" when she was hospitalized.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first confirmed measles death in the US since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032724019566" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that higher intake of sugary and artificially sweetened drinks was related to a greater risk of depression among younger adults, while fruit juices and coffee were associated with a lower risk of both depression and anxiety across age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, based at Wenzhou Medical University in China, conducted the study to explore how beverage choices might influence the risk of depression and anxiety disorders. While previous studies have suggested possible links between diet and mental health, most focused on broad dietary patterns or small groups. There has been less clarity on how specific beverages relate to mental health outcomes, especially across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mental health conditions on the rise globally, the research team wanted to examine whether commonly consumed drinks—like sugary soft drinks, diet beverages, fruit juice, coffee, milk, and tea—are linked to long-term mental health outcomes, and whether replacing one type of beverage with another might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, the researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health study that follows over 500,000 people in the United Kingdom. For this study, they focused on 188,355 adults between the ages of 37 and 73. Participants had completed one or more online diet surveys between 2009 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surveys recorded how many servings of specific beverages participants had consumed the previous day. One serving was defined as a glass, can, carton, or 250 milliliters. The study tracked six types of drinks: sugar-sweetened beverages (like soft drinks), artificially sweetened beverages (such as diet sodas), pure fruit and vegetable juices, milk, coffee, and tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine mental health outcomes, the researchers analyzed 11 years worth of hospital and primary care records. They identified new diagnoses of depression and anxiety using standardized medical codes. People who already had depression or anxiety at the start of the study were excluded. The analysis adjusted for a wide range of lifestyle, dietary, and health factors that might influence mental health, including age, sex, socioeconomic status, physical activity, body weight, sleep habits, smoking, alcohol use, and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the follow-up period, more than 5,800 participants developed depression and over 6,400 developed anxiety disorders. Among people under age 60, those who drank more than one serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a 14 percent higher risk of developing depression compared to those who avoided them. Similarly, those who drank more than one serving of artificially sweetened drinks per day had a 23 percent higher risk. On the other hand, people under 60 who consumed more than one serving of pure fruit or vegetable juice each day had a 19 percent lower risk of depression, while those who drank coffee regularly had a 12 percent lower risk. Coffee was also linked to a reduced risk of anxiety in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people aged 60 and older, the patterns were somewhat different. There was no clear link between sugary or artificially sweetened drinks and mental health. However, drinking more pure fruit or vegetable juice and coffee was again associated with a lower risk of both depression and anxiety. Tea and milk did not show consistent relationships with either condition, although replacing milk with coffee or juice in this older group was associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how beverage swaps might influence mental health, the researchers performed a substitution analysis. This method estimates what might happen if one type of drink is replaced by another. For adults under 60, replacing one daily serving of a sugar-sweetened drink with a serving of pure fruit juice or coffee was linked to a significantly lower risk of both depression and anxiety. For example, switching from soda to juice was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of depression. For older adults, replacing milk with fruit juice or coffee was associated with a lower risk of both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings remained consistent across various types of statistical analyses. These included removing participants who were current smokers or had early diagnoses, testing the results using different models, and examining the effects over shorter and longer time frames. These steps were taken to reduce the chance that the results could be explained by other factors or by changes in behavior that occurred after early symptoms of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its large sample size, the study has some limitations to consider. First, it relied on medical records to identify depression and anxiety diagnoses, which might miss milder cases that never reached clinical attention. The researchers also acknowledged that their findings are observational. This means they can show associations, but not prove that the beverages themselves caused the mental health outcomes. It is possible that people who were already at higher risk for depression or anxiety tended to drink more sweetened beverages, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.069" target="_blank"&gt;Ages-specific beverage consumption and its association with depression and anxiety disorders: A prospective cohort study in 188,355 participants&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by  Jiali Xie, Zhixian Huang, Yinan Mo, Yixuan Pan, Yubin Ruan, Wen Cao, Yinuo Chen, Yaojia Li, Kezheng Li, Danqing Yu, and Binbin Deng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>psypost.org</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 14:16:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQSS1KQXd1eWRkWVlmWG5aUlM3VUotTVZraXpmdFhnOEJFWDhqYzhLeEllSmZWUkwxNXA3dzUzVThXc09QczN4SGJyekZTTzJCanV0NUlFUGQxUjd6ZVBYbXcyN0d1YmV5WDlfYllNWF9RMnZLWnZpVGpKdk8yRlZKTGdUQW1najVyaE9uZk9leEJvblZSd2FwTFlXMnNjeUdIRFFxOHNOZGZGUjA</guid></item><item><title>Want To Burn Fat Without Losing Muscle?

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-nature-is-wild-but-is-it-healthier-than-a-dip-in-a-pool"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt;, you'll know all about the short, sharp shock it gives your senses as you plunge in. According to a new study, it can pretty quickly change the stress response of your cells too, and in a potentially positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study researchers, from the University of Ottawa in Canada, got 10 healthy young male adults to take a daily cold water dip in their lab for an hour at a time, while using blood samples to measure how their bodies were reacting on a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, the volunteers showed signs of improved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy cell recycling process that clears waste. In addition, signs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; (programmed cell death) and inflammation reduced over the week, after initially spiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156886" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg" alt="Core temperatures" class="wp-image-156886 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature-600x381.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked core body temperature as well as cell response. (King et al., &lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that consistent cold water submersion may improve our body's fundamental reaction to environmental stress – in this case, chilly temperatures. Here, it made the key stress response of autophagy more protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were amazed to see how quickly the body adapted," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Glen Kenny, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level. It's like a tune-up for your body's microscopic machinery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the initial exposure to cold water – chilled to 14 °C (57.2 °F) – was more chaotic, with "dysfunction" in autophagy processes and increased apoptosis. It settled down and became more beneficial as the week went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests the body does need time to adapt, but that the adaptation doesn't take long. The body seemed to switch from killing off cells in response to the cold conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-hearts-may-have-hidden-self-healing-powers-study-finds"&gt;to repairing cells instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the end of the acclimation, we noted a marked improvement in the participants' cellular cold tolerance," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Kelli King, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that cold acclimation may help the body effectively cope with extreme environmental conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some significant limitations to note here: first, the study only involved 10 people, who were all young men. Researchers are going to need to test this out on bigger groups of participants, including women, to see if the findings apply more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was also carried out in a very controlled lab setting. There was none of the cold air exposure and variations in temperature that you'd get with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-open-water-poses-a-serious-risk-few-people-know-about"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt; for example. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2741/S117"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have shown the way our bodies respond to cold air is different to cold water. &lt;/span&gt;These factors may also influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now found both potential &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-swimming-does-something-amazing-to-your-mind-study-reveals"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cold-water-therapy-might-do-more-harm-than-good-an-expert-explains"&gt;drawbacks&lt;/a&gt; to cold water exposure, but this new discovery could have long-term implications for our bodies: the recycling and cleaning that autophagy takes care of is crucial in preventing disease and limiting some of the wear-and-tear effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adbi.202400111"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Before being elected governor in 2022, he worked as an emergency room doctor and family physician in Hawaii for over 20 years. While serving as lieutenant governor, he led an emergency medical mission to help stop the measles epidemic in Samoa and led Hawaii’s vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic, ranked as one of the most effective in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;America’s children are in danger. Measles outbreaks are spreading in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and beyond, threatening lives, overwhelming health-care resources and exposing vulnerable communities. Texas alone has confirmed more than 400 measles cases and the death of the first child from measles in our country in more than a decade: the heartbreaking loss of a school-age child in Gaines County. The outbreaks continue to spread, gaining momentum and posing a threat to children across our country — with one public health official in Texas fearing that the outbreak there could last an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But this tragic outcome we can see coming doesn’t have to happen. We can prevent it if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious virus that hospitalizes as many as 1 in 5 of those it infects and kills 1 in every 1,000. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw hundreds of thousands of cases every year, many resulting in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Twenty-five years ago, nationwide vaccination efforts had virtually eliminated the disease in the United States by achieving vaccination rates of 95% across the country, establishing herd immunity and preventing the disease from spreading. Today, vaccination rates have been allowed to fall in many states. Experts fear that the elimination of the disease is at risk and that measles may again become a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccination campaigns save lives during outbreaks of deadly viruses. I have witnessed the lifesaving power of vaccines firsthand. During the Covid-19 pandemic – when I was serving as lieutenant governor – we vaccinated over a million people in Hawaii, saving thousands of lives and achieving the lowest infection and mortality rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, a measles outbreak swept through the island nation of Samoa. The spread of antivaccine misinformation in the previous year had caused fear and uncertainty, which kept many families from vaccinating their children against measles. The result was a devastating outbreak that infected more than 5,000 people and killed 83, mostly children. In December of 2019, I led an emergency medical mission from Hawaii to vaccinate 37,000 people in Samoa over 36 hours, rapidly raising the vaccination rate and helping to end the deadly outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from October, there are 14 states in the US where measles vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen to dangerously low levels under 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Communities with vaccination rates below the 95% threshold necessary to maintain herd immunity become fertile ground for measles outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, almost 1 in 5 kindergartners entering the school system is unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also continues to cloud these facts by describing vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoting vitamin A supplementation as a primary response to the measles outbreak. Let me be clear: Vitamin A may lessen measles complications once infection has occurred, but it does not prevent the disease. To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raynard Covarrubio, left, gives an MMR vaccine to 1-year-old River Jacobs , held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, at a vaccine clinic held by the Lubbock Public Health Department in March. - Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 13:00:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQMEdpVW5UMkxXWWkyaFFlRjZlQjBhdXA0MVBnR2lhS243bnJrSUI4aFF2RUxabUlaRUVFMjI1YTMwWWpIQkhEZTlqbFR5Q2wwM2NralF1MWlscU5Yd25Wcjg3eEdJeHk1cWlGZDNxWTFmMTNZODI5V2MzUFpmQldOS2dn</guid></item><item><title>Hawaii governor: An urgent call to action to protect America’s children from measles - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOazRTc1QxT1BjcUlwLUJTY2tGUzE2aDJobGNnZlBVVEVrM1JTeGtORFQ0dkxIZ29RNmxndTJsb3BHd095ckNxQkhPaV9oVjZIX0xfaTAwYWNkc2NpYkNPV3VWc1E3ZWx6ZXJENnlGSXp6QTdaQ05NUkc0WmpOUFlSeFBMNHVhUVhzcGR1cDZxN3bSAYcBQVVfeXFMTlEtbWI2Q0o3bXZaLThQLVJfZWNiblNQMGVfRlJGYkZqWGN1REg3dG02T19jQ3RZdWRDUENiNG8yYWd0VVdhRU1lamdVV2p2d2N6WW5MYWhsb3N0Z2tsSEtNR1VIUURvc3QwaDRBYTBNNi0zaDhtX1hCcGotam5JUEFmNGRFVEhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000c3b6ookv6sbbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000d3b6ouhggcpsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also continues to cloud these facts by describing vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoting vitamin A supplementation as a primary response to the measles outbreak. Let me be clear: Vitamin A may lessen measles complications once infection has occurred, but it does not prevent the disease. To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000e3b6ocukg67q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000f3b6oykdv4a0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000g3b6o55d1fjyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000h3b6oe0rdaogp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000i3b6og6ea5feo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000j3b6or9nngdxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000k3b6obum1gjgw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000l3b6o48nwqdcf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The economic cost of treating and the often uncompensated cost of caring for those sufferers is now more than $600 billion a year. As our population ages, that number will only grow, with one estimate projecting that the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;will double by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. It is a fate that many of us will one day suffer — according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, adults over 55 have a nearly one in two chance of eventually developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this week delivered one of the brightest spots in an otherwise dark field. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;study that followed more than 280,000 people in Wales&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who received a vaccine against shingles were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia in the seven years that followed vaccination than those who did not receive the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This could be a big deal. There are very few, if any, treatments that can prevent or slow down dementia, beyond good lifestyle habits like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;getting enough sleep and exercise&lt;/a&gt;. The possibility that a known, inexpensive vaccine could offer real protection is enormously meaningful. We have good reason to be confident in the findings: While this study is perhaps the most prominent to show the protective effects of the shingles vaccine, other &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/study-suggests-shingles-vaccine-may-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine have come to similar conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beyond the promise of preventive treatment, the new study adds further evidence to a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/03/17/do-viruses-trigger-alzheimers"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; raising the possibility that we have been thinking about neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s all wrong. It’s possible these horrible conditions are caused by a virus — and if that’s the case, eliminating the virus could be enough to prevent or treat the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To understand why the new shingles vaccine study is such a big deal, it helps to know a little bit about how medical studies are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The gold standard for research is a randomized control trial (RCT). That’s when scientists randomly assign patients to two different groups — one that receives an experimental treatment and another that doesn’t — in order to test the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. Such RCT trials minimize bias or other complicating factors, allowing scientists to be reasonably confident that any differences between the two groups — like the likelihood of developing a disease — are due to the treatment being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the real world, RCTs are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4103/0301-5742.171199#:~:text=This%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20ensure%20sufficient%20statistical%20power."&gt;often difficult and expensive to carry out&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, you need a large sample size to be confident of your results, and the control group can’t receive the treatment being studied, which creates ethical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So a lot of big medical research involves observational studies, which is a fancy term for scientists observing things happening in the real world and drawing conclusions from their research. The upside is you don’t need to go through the time and trouble of gathering a big study group and randomly dividing them in two. The downside is you’re much less certain that any observed effect is due to the variables you’re studying because you don’t control the study; you just observe it,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The new study, though, took advantage of a quirk in Welsh health policy to do something better. Beginning on September 1, 2013, anyone in Wales who was 79 became eligible to receive a free shingles vaccine. (Those who were younger than 79 would become eligible once they turned that age.) But anyone who was 80 or older was not eligible on the grounds that the vaccine is less effective for the very old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result was what is known as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/advice-and-guidance/2009/12/social-research-methods-guides/documents/natural-experiments/natural-experiments/govscot%3Adocument/Natural%2BExperiments.pdf"&gt;natural experiment&lt;/a&gt;.” In effect, Wales had created two groups that were essentially the same — save for the fact that one group received the shingles vaccine and one group did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers looked at the health records of the more than 280,000 adults who were 71 to 88 years old at the start of the vaccination program and did not have dementia. They focused on a group that was just on the dividing line: those who turned 80 just before September 1, 2013, and thus were eligible for the vaccine, and those born just after that date, who weren’t. Then, they simply looked at what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By 2020, seven years after the vaccination program began, about one in eight older adults, who by that time were 86 and 87, had developed dementia. But the group that had received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Because the researchers could find no other confounding factors that might explain the difference — like years of education or other vaccines or health conditions like diabetes — they were confident the shingles vaccine was the difference maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-new-paradigm-in-dementia-research" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A new paradigm in dementia research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the research indicates that the shingles vaccine appears to have “some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia that we know of that are potentially usable in practice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this is a vaccine originally designed to prevent shingles. Why does it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; appear to help with dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists theorize it could be related to inflammation. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the same virus responsible for chickenpox, which lies dormant in nerve cells after an initial infection and can reawaken decades later, causing painful rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That reactivation creates intense inflammation around nerve cells, and chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018624002274#:~:text=Inflammation%20has%20been%20associated%20with,%2C%20chemokines%2C%20and%20adhesion%20molecules."&gt;major factor in cognitive deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. By preventing shingles, the vaccine could indirectly protect against the neural inflammation associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What about the amyloid and tau protein plaques that tend to be found in the brains of people suffering from Alzheimer’s, which have &lt;a href="https://kin.uncg.edu/2025/02/24/plaques-and-tangles/#:~:text=Plaques%20and%20tangles%20block%20communication,detectable%20symptoms%20of%20memory%20loss."&gt;long been thought of as the primary cause of the disease&lt;/a&gt;? It’s possible that these may actually be the body’s response to an underlying infection.

But here’s something surprising, not all supplements are as safe or helpful as they seem. In fact, some of the most common ones could silently harm your gut and leave you feeling worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gut is more than just a place where food is digested. It affects our mood, immune system, and energy too. So, when certain supplements upset this delicate system, it can lead to problems you didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_120015143" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-120015143"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to TOI, naturopathic doctor Dr Janine Bowring has pointed out three such supplements we should be careful about, and shared better options to try instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Synthetic Multivitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many multivitamins sold in shops are synthetic. If the ingredient list includes things like Vitamin A as Retinyl Palmitate or Vitamin B6 as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, that’s a warning sign. These are artificial versions, not the kind your body naturally gets from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to TOI, Dr Bowring says these synthetic types can irritate the gut lining, disturb the balance of good bacteria, and even overload the liver over time. Since they’re harder to break down, your body may struggle to use them and instead work harder to get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_120015143" id="div-vdoai-mid-120015143"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-120015143" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose multivitamins made from real food sources. These whole food-based options are easier on the gut and more natural. Or even better, get your nutrients from foods like leafy greens, fruits, seeds, and nuts, because nature knows best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-120015143" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-120015143" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-120015143" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is very important for your energy and nerve health. But there’s a catch. If your B12 supplement says cyanocobalamin, it’s a synthetic version that contains a small amount of cyanide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOI reports that while the dose is small, taking it regularly can affect how your body removes toxins. It may also irritate your gut and liver, especially if you already have health problems like IBS or low stomach acid. Worse, your body may not absorb it properly, which could make things worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better choice:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin, these are natural forms your body can use more easily. Also, try to eat more B12-rich foods like eggs, dairy, and fish. Fermented foods such as curd are great too, they support gut health and help your body absorb B12 better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Magnesium Stearate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium stearate isn’t a vitamin, but it’s a common additive in many pills. It helps the tablets move smoothly during manufacturing. Sounds harmless, right? But TOI notes that this ingredient might actually be a silent disruptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest magnesium stearate can form a coating in your gut, stopping nutrients from being properly absorbed. It might also reduce the power of probiotics and damage the gut’s natural barrier over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to look for instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick supplements without added chemicals like magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, or artificial colours. Look for ones that say “clean label” or “additive-free” on the pack. And once again, getting nutrients straight from food is the healthiest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Word of Caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easy to fall for shiny packaging and bold claims on supplement bottles. But as TOI highlights, your gut health is too precious to risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always read the labels, check what’s inside, and when in doubt, choose food over pills. If you’re unsure, talk to a nutritionist or functional medicine expert. They can guide you on what your body really needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, less is more, and a clean, balanced diet can do much more than a shelf full of synthetic vitamins ever will.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The test involved pressing one of two levers to get a water droplet with some sugar in it — a simple task that rats learned how to do quickly to get their sweet treat. To complicate the game, however, the researchers would switch reward levers every few minutes, prompting the rats to figure out the timing of switches to get the reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy," noted a &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/04/02/how-alcohol-abuse-damages-cognition/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20Distinguished%20Professor-,%22We%20now%20have%20a%20new%20model%20for%20the%20unfortunate%20cognitive,studies%20the%20biology%20of%20addiction." class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement about the research&lt;/a&gt;. "The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers contend that their results are the first of their kind because prior alcohol studies that used animals did not "demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making" the way theirs did. This was likely due to the decision-making tests being too easy, the scientists claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our experiment was quite challenging, and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn't do it as well," Janak, the paper's first author, said in the Hopkins statement. "When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats' decision-related neural signals were stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team linked the alcohol-exposed rats' difficulties with the tests to "dramatic" changes in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain that governs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/dorsomedial-striatum" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3273324/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;behavioral decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. A known center for reward and expectations, the dorsomedial striatum has long been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00028/full" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;associated with addictive and compulsive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; — but this study seems to be the first to ever show just how much the neural circuits had been damaged by booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers indicated that they were surprised that the brain damage from alcohol lasted so long, which "may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high," Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab," the neuroscientist said. "We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the cognitive effects were only present in the male rats that were studied and not their female counterparts. While there's no reason to believe females aren't subject to alcohol-related brain damage, this finding suggests, per the Hopkins press release, that there "could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it does seem &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-dont-rats-get-the-same-ethical-protections-as-primates" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;kind of cruel&lt;/a&gt; to get rats so plastered that they suffer brain damage — especially when there are plenty of human alcoholics out there who would be willing to be studied. Still, these findings could be helpful in future addiction studies, and are fascinating to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on booze: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/man-builds-robot-force-alcohol" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Builds Robot to Force-Feed Him Alcohol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 12:15:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9PbVE0ZGFKTkhEZFJZQXN4WFVBWkR0NzBPVnhVZnlWZFRZelllelE1NnVYWjQ3V19WTDVZVkU5QlRSRGZIZVZGTGhoUDBMZ0I1M0N6dk1IMWRMWVlyS2t3Rk8zemltVjg</guid></item><item><title>Grand Forks woman receives ‘gift of life’ in liver transplant - Grand Forks Herald</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNMjZRUlNWb3NvUFFyamJvTDhZd0xHRXpyQm5XbnlCQ0NBZTctTm9Wd2ZSZ1NfaTlwX3JvUklTRll5eHRJQkdmaUZOempGTkJmMGUtMWZGa1hETXM0a3ctb01pVElSRWFQa1I3YjBYNE91c0hlb3NxT1JRdnlZNmNkbFNNb1V2UmJMc0hNRVJibkRTSE5iVlIwNm9weFQwcHVX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody"&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;GRAND FORKS — For the last couple of years, Gloria Gebur had been waiting for an organ transplant donor, as her health deteriorated and she battled a disease that causes chronic liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She finally found one — an unexpected one.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Last fall, her niece, Michaela Hill, 35, secretly sought testing as a possible donor at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She learned she qualified as a match for the woman who “was always a second mother to me,” she said, and “taught me so much about how to live my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hill called to tell her she was a match, Gebur recalled, “she said something like, ‘Auntie, Auntie, I’m going to give you part of my liver; it’s all set up. … ’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I burst into tears,” said Gebur. “Pretty exciting for me. And a big commitment on her part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About her niece becoming her donor, Gebur said, “It’s pretty special. I was not expecting it at all. ... We were just really thrilled that she was willing to give of herself like this … ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill is the daughter of Steven and Deb Hill of Grand Forks; Deb and Gloria are sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gloria and Jim Gebur moved here in 2023 after more than 40 years in Drayton, North Dakota. She served as administrative director of health services at the Life Skills Transition Center in Grafton, for 41 years, and he was a math teacher for 45 years with Drayton Public Schools.&lt;/p&gt;

It takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue and other symptoms progressed; she had “a lot of episodes” with bleeding in her esophagus, she said, “and it was very scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms became severe in August 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gebur underwent a procedure locally that “stabilized things for me temporarily, so, for about a year, I was feeling much better than I had been previously,” she said, “and I was in pretty good shape when I actually had the transplant, which was a big blessing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a liver transplant was her only hope for long-term survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking medical care at Mayo Clinic, Gebur was placed on the transplant list about two years ago, she said, and doctors there worked with her for more than a year as she prepared for the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;About 9,500 people are on a waiting list for a liver transplant, according to OrganDonor.gov. About 20% either die or become too sick while waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Donors must be between the ages of 18 and 60, be in excellent health and have a compatible blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Mayo Clinic patient-education booklet, the donated part of the liver grows in the recipient until it reaches the size the recipient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor’s liver usually grows back to full size within a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really interesting how livers are — they regrow quickly,” Gebur said. “It’s a big miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Gebur’s condition, a liver transplant “was the most sustainable treatment option for her,” Hill said. “The number of people waiting for a liver transplant greatly exceeds the number of available deceased-donor livers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a deceased-donor transplant is also an option, Gebur did not place high enough on the triage list for that kind of transplant, so a living-donor transplant was her best option, Hill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic has one of the largest living-donor and liver transplant programs in the country. Its surgeons perform more than 500 liver transplants each year, including many from living liver donors.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Gebur receives continuing care locally, including weekly blood draws with results sent to Mayo and medications that are supervised by Mayo physicians. She’ll undergo periodic check-ups at Mayo Clinic. Because her immune system is weakened, she takes meds that prevent rejection of the new liver, wears a mask in public and avoids crowds and people who are ill.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;About a year ago, Hill became aware of her aunt’s need for a transplant, she said, and in the summer she and her cousins talked about being tested as potential donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A liver transplant was “a last, sort of end treatment,” said Hill, who lives with her husband and their children, ages 4 and 2, in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donation process “takes a lot of time — six weeks minimum,” she said. “You have to be able to take time off from work,” in addition to making other lifestyle accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60% of people who undergo testing to determine eligibility as donors do not match for lots of reasons, she said, among them, anatomical incompatibility — physical features of the liver are not a fit for the recipient — and certain serious health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill wanted to explore the possibility because of what Gebur meant to her as a positive role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Throughout her life, my aunt has always been an incredible example of love and sacrifice for her family,” Hill said. “Her love language is definitely ‘acts of service to others’ — constantly taking care of those around her through her career as a nurse, loving mother, aunt and wife.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;She taught me a lot about how to live a life full of love and dedication to family.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
      &lt;div class="Enhancement"&gt;
            &lt;p class="Enhancement-item"&gt;
                
                
                    
                        
                            &lt;h2&gt;Psychological, physical testing&lt;/h2&gt;
                        
                    
                
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;“When the time came for someone to step up to help her, I was immediately intrigued at the possibility,” she said. But becoming a donor is far from a simple process, she found out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually quite difficult to be approved,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In determining her eligibility, Hill first completed an in-person evaluation and two rounds of phone interviews with a nurse and a donor advocate in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At that time, I didn’t know if I would be a match or not, so I hadn’t made a final decision yet,” she said. “I wanted to know if I would even be a match before I went through the process of deciding it was something that I would be willing and able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to her aunt, she began to explore the possibility of becoming a donor with members of Mayo’s transplant team. She did not tell her aunt, she said, because “I didn’t want to get her hopes up. It can be disappointing if she knew and then I wasn’t a match.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testing involved an online evaluation, in-person interviews and, after that, in-person extensive psychological and physical examinations — a process that lasted more than four days. She met with nurses, doctors, social workers, donor advocates and surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;She underwent numerous tests, including anatomical scans, blood work, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography) scans and echocardiogram, and was informed about the possible complications and percentages of catastrophic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The decision to become a donor was not a simple one, said Hill,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;who is not only a wife and mother of very young children but also holds down a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a young, relatively healthy, active donor, my chances of devastating complications were low, however nevertheless possible, as with any major open-abdominal surgery,” Hill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is grateful to her parents — both medical professionals — who put those risks “into perspective to help me make an informed decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hill learned she was a match, she worried that Mayo might not have an available date for the surgery in December, the month that would work best for her work schedule. Setting the date required the availability of five doctors – two for the recipient, two for the donor and one “floating” doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hill finally received the email, “‘We have a December date for you!,’ I was overjoyed and simultaneously very nervous. Then it became very real,” she said. It was time to make the final decision and tell her aunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the decision to donate a portion of her liver was “tough,” requiring thoughtful consideration, especially as a mom of young children, she said. “I had to trust my faith and intuition that this was something I was meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once I fully accepted the chance to live out this incredible opportunity to give a gift of life to my aunt, and with the unending support of my family, it became an easy ‘yes’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From her home in Spain, she connected with her aunt via FaceTime in October and told her the good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think she was shocked. She had not given up hope, but she was not expecting it,” Hill said. “She was excited and thrilled. I could see the relief of finding a match. … It was fun because I was able to tell her not only that I was a match, but also that we had an approved surgery date in about two months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery was scheduled for Dec. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was quite a Christmas present,” Gebur told the Herald in a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;During the surgery, doctors removed almost 70% of Hill’s liver, which — after Gebur’s defective liver was removed — was immediately placed in her aunt’s body where the bile ducts and blood vessels were reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took about four hours, Hill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both came through it “very well” and without any significant complications, said Dr. Steven Hill of Grand Forks, Michaela Hill’s father. He and his wife “are so proud of Michaela for this selfless and wonderful gift to Gloria …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the transplant surgery, Hill’s recovery went “really smoothly,” she recalled. She was up and walking the day of the surgery and, after six days in the hospital, she was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Gebur spent time recovering in the Gift of Life Transplant House in Rochester.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Hill returned to Grand Forks after about two weeks and, in early January, flew home to Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gebur, who returned to Grand Forks on Jan. 10, describes the Gift of Life house as “a really beautiful place,” where people who’ve undergone various transplants — lung, hearts, kidney, liver and STEM cell — support each other.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="Figure-content"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Figure-caption"&gt;Michaela Hill (left) and her aunt Gloria Gebur pose in the Gift of Life Transplant House in Rochester, Minnesota, about a week after their Dec. 17 liver transplant surgery at Mayo Clinic.   &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-credit"&gt;Contributed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

                        
                    
                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;For Hill, “by about six weeks, almost all incisional pain was gone and I started feeling almost back to normal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her restrictions included not lifting anything over 10 pounds and not drinking alcohol for six months. The only medication she needed was for pain management, she said, and for about three months, aspirin to prevent blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Looking back, Hill said, “I’m grateful that I was able to make the journey of my aunt’s liver treatment a little easier and I hope that my actions may inspire others to do the same for someone in their life. It certainly doesn’t need to be a major surgery, but even a small act of intentional kindness can go a long way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the liver donation, Hill said, “I knew she needed it, and I could do it. … I’m thankful for the experience and what it’s taught me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Gebur feels “real good,” she said. “I’m up and around, and walking and doing pretty much everything I did before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has relied on her Christian faith to carry her through the trying times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver transplant “is definitely a real blessing for me — it’s a gift from God,” Gebur said. “I do have a strong faith, and I really do feel like, you know, God has been watching out for me all the while I’ve been going through this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, “Philippians 4:6-7 is a verse I really do believe in,” she said. “It says, ‘Don’t worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank Him for all He has done. If you do this, you will experience God’s peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.’ …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a real special verse for me, because God really did give me peace during these two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dqu39002j3572okzr07zz@published"&gt;While I was dating my college boyfriend, my sister started to date his brother. My relationship started getting rocky, and I had a choice between starting a new job in a different city or working on my relationship. My boyfriend was adamant that I not take the job and stay here with him. I made the mistake of staying. We broke up a year later because I found him cheating on me. My sister was still dating his brother and they ended up engaged. It was very difficult for me to be around my sister and her fiancé. After they got married, holidays were even worse. I struggled but moved on. Well, several years later, they are in the process of getting a divorce. And my brother-in-law just decided to nuke my relationship with my sister by sending me a taunting text containing a major shock.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dodx2004jr7m7ge3bis67@published"&gt;In it, he revealed his brother had been cheating on me a long time before I found out, and my sister knew all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ep002o3572jg5t7554@published"&gt;I called my sister in tears and she confessed. I screamed at her. She was the one that encouraged me to stay and skip my chance at a new job. I called her a selfish whore and said that I considered her dead to me now. In the aftermath, our parents are more upset at me for adding more stress to my sister than about what happened to me. They say it was years ago and that I am overreacting. This has me so sick that my doctor put me on anxiety medication. I don’t know how to go on from here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002r35720qpp0haz@published"&gt;Don’t let the terrorists (these two awful brothers) win. It’s not fair that your boyfriend cheated on you, and it’s even worse that your brother-in-law went out of his way to hurt you on his way out the door. I’ll be transparent about my agenda here: I don’t want this story to end with the two bad guy exes living happily ever after and enjoying each other’s company while you and you and your sister have to cope without each other. You say “My BIL decided to nuke my relationship with my sister” —but his whole plan fails if you don’t let him do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="224" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002s357292jmy4mx@published"&gt;Also, totally separate from my desire for a narrative in which the terrible men don’t come out on top, I think your relationship with your sister is worth saving. Yes, it’s fair to be upset with her, to wish she’d made a different choice with regard to telling you about the cheating, and to need some time to get over it. But her behavior doesn’t rise to “selfish whore who is dead to me” levels. People often write to me often asking for advice on whether to tell a loved one that their partner is being unfaithful. It’s a common dilemma because this is a situation in which it’s really hard to know what the victim of infidelity would want. While some are grateful for the intel, plenty of others become outraged at the deliverer of bad news. I’ve made the case before that when there is cheating, there are almost always clues and that person in the relationship could pursue if they truly wanted to know, so there’s no obligation to inform them. But whether to speak up is a legitimately tough call—one about which good, kind people can disagree. Sometimes I think we should get ahead of the issue by giving our friends and family instructions about whether we’d want to be informed if they ever suspected that our partners were cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7et002t3572pd02myan@published"&gt;What you’re experiencing is real pain and distress, and I would never agree that you’re overreacting or that the time that’s passed means you should be over it. But I suspect your response might be more about how much being cheated on all those years ago hurt you—and your shame over making a “mistake”— and less about what your sister knew and when. I hope the anti-anxiety medication is helping, and I wonder if it will give you the mental space to process what happened in your relationship, why you made the choice you did, and how you can forgive yourself for staying in a city with a guy who turned out not to be worth it. That’s a totally understandable (and extremely common) decision. And it’s worth noting that it did not ruin your life. I hope you can make peace with it and see it as part of your journey rather than something that derailed you completely. If you can do that, you may begin to see your sister is also someone who has made missteps but isn’t defined by them, and perhaps the two of you can figure out your next steps together.&lt;/p&gt;

I walk with a cane and have difficulty standing, etc., due to a bad accident. The other day, I went to put laundry in (there are two medium-sized washers). One had finished, and the empty one rejected my laundry card, so I simply emptied the done one into a cart. A new neighbor came and was upset that I “touched his laundry and didn’t wait for him.” I thought maybe he didn’t realize normal etiquette and that I use a cane. He was still demanding an apology. I said write a note to the board. I refrained from saying he had poor manners. I don’t feel obligated to teach a grown, able man what entitlement is. Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev002z35722ucb2jl6@published"&gt;Your neighbor should know that if you use shared laundry facilities and don’t want anyone to touch your clothes, you need to either bring some work or entertainment and set up shop in the laundry room so you’re there when each load is done, or implement a very good alarm system to remind you to run down and grab your stuff. (If you’re waiting for a machine, it’s considerate to give the current user maybe five minutes after the buzzer to show up, but no longer.) That’s the rule! And even if he’s truly confused about how this works, he should have extended some empathy to you and the fact that you can’t comfortably stand around waiting for people to remember that they’re washing clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00303572m73qi66x@published"&gt;You were right and he was wrong. But forget the lesson on manners and entitlement. In the same way that we all have to be responsible for our own clothes and not our neighbors, his bad personality is his business, and it’s not your job to provide guidance on how to be a considerate human being. “Write a note to the board” (a polite way of saying “Take it up with someone who cares, and by the way, they’re not going to be on your side”) was the perfect response, and you should use it again if you find yourself in this situation in the future. But I suspect your neighbor’s horror at having his wet clothes touched might have been the reminder he needed to time his loads better.&lt;/p&gt;

I started dating “B” just shortly after coming out, and he was my first relationship. Things were peachy, save for a few disagreements here and there. When I say I’m fresh out of this relationship, it’s more “raw” than “minty.” It wasn’t my decision. My boyfriend, after months of sharing our personalities, time, and baggage, told me that his anxiety was making our relationship “suffocating” and that he would need to move on to take better care of his mental health. I had known about his anxiety and worked to foster an environment where he could feel honest about how he’s feeling and share whatever he felt comfortable with. The problem, however, is that he still held back. He said that he tried to sweep it under the rug throughout our relationship, but the kettle was boiling and he just couldn’t ignore the whistle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex003435727g0md1y3@published"&gt;The shock hit me like a silver bullet. How could the man I love decide to stumble out of a relationship rather than grant me the opportunity to talk though his pain? How do I even know if his intention to seek help was genuine? Was it really his anxiety that suffocated our relationship, or was it me? These questions and any number like them still own my mind over a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex00353572vr6bmmt3@published"&gt;Now, we’re no-contact and according to what little information I have available (through social media), he’s positively enjoying his relationship-free life. He leaves no sign of the anxiety that reportedly damned our relationship, and he certainly doesn’t let it get in the way of clubbing, concerts, and other fun outings. Is he just sweeping it under the rug again? Is there any hope of us reconnecting? And, if there is, will I just end up getting burned again?&lt;/p&gt;

People break up and make up all the time. But I encourage you not to pursue that. Block him on Instagram, and consider the relationship over. Forever. This advice is based on a few rules that I think apply to your situation:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00393572itbf2s62@published"&gt;- No-contact should include no following on social media (which, by the way, doesn’t provide an accurate representation of anyone’s mood or mental state).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003a35723t9o9gna@published"&gt;- People are allowed to break up with you with no due process, for reasons that aren’t fair or honest or don’t make sense or are based on their own weird stuff and poor choices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003b3572s70tbdra@published"&gt;- It’s a bad idea to chase someone who doesn’t want you.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003c3572gnao4a6f@published"&gt;I know it’s not as simple as simply deciding to be done, and when someone doesn’t hold up their end of the relationship or share their true feelings, it can feel disorienting, and even like an injustice. You’re allowed to hate the way things turned out between the two of you and be frustrated that he didn’t work harder to address his mental health and nurture his connection with you at the same time. Rant about it to your friends, invite them to rant about it back to you, journal, scream—do whatever you need to. Except trying to reconnect with him. Instead, try to tap into the part of you that was eager to be in an open, supportive, healthy relationship and start to think about looking for someone who wants the same and is willing to work as hard as you are to make it happen. After all, if you were so invested in a relationship with a guy who found it suffocating, imagine how much better it will be when you find someone for whom being your partner is &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I really do not want to be poly, and having kids in a few years (I’m 28 now, he is 30) is really important to me. But I feel regret and wonder if I should get back together with him and if this is just a big struggle we have to overcome. He is dating his crush already, and she is poly. Since he met her, he is convinced that being poly is the thing that will make him happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/dear-prudence-sexist-demand.html"&gt;Should I try to fight for us? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet is filled with foods that can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians’ top Mediterranean diet weight-loss foods are lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods are rich in nutrients that help with weight management, like protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;has long been celebrated as one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. So, it’s no surprise that it’s also linked to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This diet emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods like fresh produce, hearty whole grains, beans, healthy fats and small amounts of lean protein. And it’s low in added sugars, red meat and highly processed foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike restrictive diets that may feel unsustainable, the Mediterranean diet is more of a lifestyle approach, focusing on balance and enjoyment. That, in turn, may make it easier to stick with over time. What makes this diet even more appealing for weight management is its sheer variety of healthy, satisfying foods that naturally help you eat less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, there are lots of foods to choose from. So, we asked dietitians which Mediterranean diet foods stand out for weight loss. Here are their five favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-lentils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Lentils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a versatile, nutritious food to incorporate into your meals, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; are an outstanding choice. What makes them so powerful for weight loss? “Lentils are an excellent source of plant-based protein, and they are high in fiber, both nutrients that help keep you satiated and keep blood sugar levels stable,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicalevinson.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jessica Levinson, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary nutrition expert in Westchester, New York. One cup of cooked lentils has 16 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Combined, these may help reduce overall caloric intake, thereby promoting weight loss, says Levinson. For instance, one study found that people who ate more legumes, like lentils, had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines and were less likely to gain weight over 10 years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for ways to add more of these mighty legumes to your diet, think soup. Whether it’s our Mediterranean-inspired &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7938176/red-lentil-soup-with-saffron/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Red Lentil Soup with Saffron&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250654/slow-cooker-spiced-lentil-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Slow-Cooker Spiced Lentil Soup with Vegetables&lt;/a&gt; or this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7873875/vegan-weight-loss-lentil-soup/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Vegan Weight-Loss Lentil Soup&lt;/a&gt;, a nourishing bowl of protein- and fiber-rich soup will keep you full and satisfied.

This thick, creamy dairy product is made by straining regular yogurt to remove excess whey, resulting in a concentrated protein content. One single-serve 5.6-ounce container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt provides an impressive 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That protein helps with weight loss in multiple ways, such as reducing appetite and increasing calorie-burning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The probiotics in Greek yogurt also improve gut health, which is increasingly linked to better weight regulation and reduced inflammation,” explains Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No wonder research has found that yogurt, as part of a balanced and healthy diet, may help prevent and manage obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

In fact, one study found that healthy-weight adults living in the U.K. were more likely to consume chickpeas than people living with overweight or obesity. And they had healthier diets, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to wholesome and convenient Mediterranean diet–friendly snacks, few foods are as satisfying and nutritious as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;. “Nuts, like almonds and walnuts, are an essential Mediterranean diet food to have on hand,” says &lt;a href="http://www.inutritioncenter.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Integrated Nutrition for Weight Loss. “They’re packed with healthy fats, fiber and protein to help you stay full longer, making them a great snack for weight management.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re worried about their fat, you can relax. Evidence finds that even though nuts are high in fat, eating them doesn’t lead to weight gain. Instead, the opposite is true. A wide body of research shows that nuts may help with weight control and prevent long-term weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole fruits and vegetables are the foundations of the Mediterranean diet. While all produce is a win for weight loss, green leafy vegetables have decided benefits. Leafy greens, like spinach, kale and Swiss chard, are naturally low in calories, rich in fiber and high in volume. So, they fill you up with negligible calories. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spinach is, perhaps, the most noteworthy leafy green in the Mediterranean diet. With a mere 7 calories per cup, this satisfying green provides fiber, iron, vitamin C and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, spinach contains compounds called thylakoids that may also support weight management by helping the body use insulin more effectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet offers a sustainable, enjoyable, nutrient-dense approach to healthy eating and weight management. By including a variety of wholesome foods like lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and green leafy vegetables like spinach, you can create satisfying meals that support your health goals while celebrating the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean region. That said, there are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of foods to choose from. If you’re new to the Mediterranean diet, start small by incorporating a few of these foods into your daily meals and experience how delicious and nutritious eating can truly be.

So, once again, not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is fiber?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber comes from whole fruits and vegetables, which most people under-consume, Mullins said. Additionally, many folks turn to white flour, white bread and white rice instead of their whole-grain alternatives, and fiber is stripped when companies make these white-flour versions, said Elnakib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is the part of the food that we don’t normally digest, so humans can’t digest this part of the food, and so it’s often in plant-based foods,” Elnakib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s two kinds of fiber, she explained. Soluble fiber can be dissolved in water, “and basically that part of the fiber creates kind of like a gel-like substance when you eat it and it’s in your gut,” Elnakib said. “That actually pulls all of the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/high-cholesterol" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/high-cholesterol" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, the fat and the sugars in your gut so they don’t enter your bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other kind of fiber is insoluble fiber, which is “that other part of the food that we cannot digest ... Think about the skin of an apple or a blueberry skin,” Elnakib said. “What they do is really just create bulk in our stool and soften our stool so that we have easier bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to eat enough fiber every day ― and you’re likely not getting the recommended amount. Below, experts share the signs that you’re not eating enough fiber and explain how to add more of it to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You’re regularly constipated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number one sign that someone has an inadequate fiber intake is constipation,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lon Ben-Asher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Lon Ben-Asher&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Pritikin Longevity Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inadequate fiber intake makes it a lot more difficult for stool to pass through the GI tract, and it creates more infrequent bowel movements,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, fiber helps add bulk to the stool, which in turn “helps food pass through the gastrointestinal tract a lot easier,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You get hungry again soon after a meal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the signs that you may not be consuming enough fiber is if you feel hungry shortly after eating,” Mullins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because you’re eating foods, such as sugars and refined carbs, that are absorbed quickly, she said. “One of the great benefits of fiber... is that it really helps to make you feel full and to feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because fiber isn’t very digestible, it can kind of sit in our stomach for a while and slow down the absorption of other nutrients, which is one of the ways that it helps to regulate blood sugar,” Mullins noted. “But what this also does is helps us to feel full and feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You have stomach discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign you aren’t eating enough fiber? Uncomfortable digestive symptoms like cramping, bloating and gas can be a red flag, said Ben-Asher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary fiber helps maintain a very, very healthy gastrointestinal tract,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: The Good Brigade via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Good Brigade via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Beans and legumes are a great way to get your daily fiber.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can eat more fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since you find fiber in plants, [you] could eat more plant foods, and [you] could eat plant foods that they can recognize as plants,” Mullins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole veggies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans and legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just for reference: 2 tablespoons of chia seeds have 10 grams of fiber, 1 cup of lentils has 18 grams of fiber, 1 cup of broccoli has 5 grams of fiber, 1 cup of whole wheat pasta has 7 grams of fiber, and 1 cup of blackberries contains 7.5 grams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really important for people who don’t consume enough fiber... to kind of go slow and steady,” said Ben-Asher. “You want to gradually increase your fiber intake, because if you go from a very low-fiber to a very, very high-fiber diet, the gut and the body is not used to it, and so it has to assimilate, and it takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who dive in too quickly may notice issues like gas, bloating, stomach discomfort, constipation and more, Ben-Asher added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gradually increasing fiber slowly can really help your body adjust to it and reduce those risks of those side effects,” he said. “So, ways that we encourage people to do it is try to increase your fiber intake by adding one more serving of vegetables per day, [and] trying to increase fruit consumption, so maybe even having one more serving of fruit per day as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, think about the carbohydrates you’re eating. Instead of eating ultra-processed carbs, opt for items you can pick from a garden, such as sweet potatoes and beans, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And instead of eating white bread or white rice, choose breads and grains that are whole-grain, Elnakib said. But be careful not to just pick out bread or grain that’s dyed brown, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re looking at whole-grain products, actually look at the back and make sure that it is made from whole grain versus just brown products because that’s not always the same,” Elnakib explained. Make sure you’re “looking at the back and you’re checking to see that it says ‘whole grain flour’ or ‘whole grain sorghum wheat’ or pasta or whatever it is that you’re using ... Multi-grain is great, too, because then you get different kinds of whole grains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber supplements can be helpful, but they aren’t the same as fiber-rich food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may be easy to take a dietary fiber pill or powder, it’s not necessarily as effective as eating fiber from a plant source, Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think in certain situations, taking a supplement can be effective and helpful to certain people,” he said. “But the science and the research and the evidence-based literature does not support that getting fiber from a supplemental source has the same impact on our health as consuming fiber from real whole plant foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to the store to pick up a fiber supplement, spend that time looking up &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber-packed recipes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;fiber-packed recipes&lt;/a&gt; like bean salads, chili, split pea soup, whole wheat pasta with veggies and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important for people really to try to focus a little bit more on their dietary approach and adding fiber from food, as opposed to from a lot of the supplements that people take,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re concerned about your fiber intake, consider talking to a dietitian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to cooking the same low-fiber meals, it can feel overwhelming to make the switch. A registered dietitian can help you come up with recipes and decipher just how much fiber you’re regularly eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might ask you to keep a food log of everything you eat from anywhere from three to seven days,” Mullins said. From there, they can “estimate how much fiber you’re consuming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

But for infectious disease specialists like Peter Chin-Hong, one of the most insidious threats lurking in &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care"&gt;hospitals and clinics&lt;/a&gt; today is fungal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Chin-Hong’s case list is long: a healthy 29-year-old marathon runner from California’s Central Valley whose heart lining was invaded by Coccidioides, a soil-dwelling fungus; a lung transplant recipient coughing up mold nodules - fungal growths scattered throughout his lungs - after stopping antifungal medication; and a 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, infected by a black fungus that destroyed part of her face and spread to her brain. Despite multiple surgeries and treatment, she died in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“These aren’t rare anymore,” said Chin-Hong, associate dean and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “We’re seeing them every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Once considered obscure or opportunistic, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2023/03/22/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate-in-the-us-heres-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2023/03/22/a-deadly-fungus-is-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate-in-the-us-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;invasive fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are now surfacing with alarming frequency - and in patients and places doctors never used to worry about. Climate change is expanding the geographic reach of fungi. Medical advances like organ transplants, chemotherapy, and intensive care are saving lives, but they also leave more patients immunocompromised. Even common conditions like diabetes raise the risk of severe fungal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Business Briefing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Become a business insider with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;An estimated 6.5 million people develop invasive fungal infections each year, with about 2.5 million deaths directly caused by them — roughly twice the global toll of tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Many of those deaths are in people with advanced HIV, and experts warn the problem may worsen as funding for global HIV/AIDS programs is pulled back. A surge in AIDS-related illness, they say, could turbocharge the fungal crisis, especially in low-resource settings where diagnostic tools and antifungal treatments are already limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Adding to the danger is the rise of drug-resistant infections - strains that no longer respond to the limited arsenal of antifungal medications. Candida auris, a newly emerging yeast first seen in 2009, has already triggered deadly outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Experts warn that broader resistance could soon outpace the slow development of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Fungal Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-04-2025-who-issues-its-first-ever-reports-on-tests-and-treatments-for-fungal-infections"&gt;critical global gaps in the ability to diagnose and treat fungal infections&lt;/a&gt;. That includes the dangerously thin pipeline of medicines, with just four new antifungals approved globally over the past decade. Of the nine currently in clinical development, only three have reached the final stage of patient studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We can expect few new approvals in the next 10 years,” said Valeria Gigante, who leads the antimicrobial resistance division at WHO in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;More than half of the antifungal candidates in development lack true innovation, limiting their ability to counter emerging resistance, Gigante added. “We always need new ways to kill dangerous fungi,” she said. “Only three of the nine candidates even target the most critical pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/"&gt;Fungal threats&lt;/a&gt; have remained dangerously overlooked, said Justin Beardsley, an infectious diseases doctor and University of Sydney researcher who contributed to both WHO reports. “Fungus is not on anybody’s radar,” he said. “It’s unobserved and out of control — which means we’re not developing mitigations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;He also pointed to growing concern over agricultural antifungal use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of the new drugs being developed don’t have a novel mechanism of action,” Beardsley said. And in many cases, new compounds are introduced faster in agriculture to protect crops from diseases like powdery mildew. “That is just really disheartening for human drug developers — and a little bit worrying for public health, that our new-hope drugs are already going to be getting exposed to a biosimilar agent in the environment and we’re going to get resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Another shortcoming is around diagnostics, with the WHO cautioning that even when tests exist to identify deadly fungi, they’re often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. Most rely on well-equipped laboratories and trained personnel. The development of systems to detect invasive fungal infections and determine drug susceptibility is also lagging behind what exists for bacteria, Gigante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Unseen Foe&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Fungal infections behave differently from bacteria and viruses. They rarely spread person to person. Instead, most come from the environment - moldy soil, decaying plants, airborne spores. Some spores can even travel high into the atmosphere and drift across continents, making them especially hard to track or control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;That makes it nearly impossible to fully protect vulnerable patients. UCSF’s Chin-Hong said doctors often prescribe preventive antifungal medication to people at high risk, such as those who’ve had lung or blood stem cell transplants. But the drugs don’t cover every type of mold. Mucormycosis — a rare but aggressive infection - is notoriously difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article id="related-story-embed-YR4KYD3PFFH4JP6NHVIGUU5K2M" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"&gt;&lt;label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark"&gt;Related:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/news/public-health/2022/07/12/superbug-infections-deaths-rose-at-beginning-of-pandemic/"&gt;Superbug infections, deaths rose at beginning of pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Mucormycosis is probably the scariest one we have,” Chin-Hong said. “If it gets into the lungs, the death rate can be as high as 87%.” The fungus can also invade the sinuses and spread to the brain, with a mortality rate around 50%. It causes tissue to die - cutting off blood flow so antifungal drugs can’t reach the infection site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“You have to surgically remove the infected area,” he said. “A lot of times people have their eye taken out because it goes up through the sinus cavity, and there’s no good treatment for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Resection - surgically removing infected tissue - is sometimes possible in the sinuses or skin. But in the lungs, it’s often far more difficult. “The reason lung mortality is so high is because you can’t just cut out big chunks of lung,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And even when drugs work, they’re often less effective in the very patients who need them most — those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We have agents now,” Chin-Hong said, “but we’re running out of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Jason Gale, Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__bZ-w3 py-5 px-7 border border-gray-light my-8 clear-both"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block pr-8 shrink-0 w-auto flex flex-col" href="/news/public-health/2025/04/05/plan-to-cover-anti-obesity-drugs-through-medicare-is-dropped/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__6H-hI dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/JIUFXZFZ2RO57J2XPKZ6XYL6VQ.jpg?auth=3ef4b555ef236fd6eb1c2e6d5941b109f0b8f7cf282bd9cc80f1a2afda392925&amp;amp;height=127&amp;amp;width=190&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Wegovy is a drug used for weight loss.

There’s even a cottage industry of lice removal services that promise to use hot air to dehydrate the lice and kill them. One recently opened in Mattydale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKSG7Q67FZFBRB7IPNJJFWUDXY"&gt;Here’s what the experts recommend: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="REMHBZILDZBMVN3UGEKKRBU3FM"&gt;Recently, Dracker began prescribing spinosad (brand name Natroba), an FDA-approved topical lice removal treatment. The primary side effects are dry skin and mild irritation, and the treatment boasts “no nit-combing required.” Dracker said the efficacy rate of the prescription treatment is “nearly 100%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVAIWTL47VBOZANRYPFRO6DT54"&gt;Dr. Debra Jaliman, a New York City-based dermatologist, also frequently encounters super lice at her practice. Jaliman recommends that patients see a board-certified dermatologist for a proper diagnosis, as an itchy scalp “can be caused by seborrheic dermatitis, an allergic reaction or even dry skin.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2VQADM7SB5AHJPLSN347SZEW74"&gt;Jaliman said that patients may start over-the-counter treatments, like Rid or Nix, before seeking a prescription. She also stresses the importance of washing brushes, combs, hair accessories, bedding and linen in hot water, as well as vacuuming all upholstery and carpets around the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y6XM45MZWRCLPH3RCQVMA7J62Y"&gt;If a patient needs a prescription treatment, Jaliman said she opts for ivermectin or malathion. She has not used Natroba. Ivermectin can be taken orally as a pill and repeated a week after to ensure the lice are removed. Though it is not FDA-approved to treat lice specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0905471#:~:text=In%20the%20per%2Dprotocol%20population,11.8%3B%20P%3D0.002" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies have shown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the efficacy rate in lice removal is over 90%.

(AAFA) projects that 2025 will be yet another brutal year for seasonal allergies across the country, with the worst-afflicted cities in the southern US. Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you—seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm"&gt;one in three US adults and one in four children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Why? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;sirens of climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said &lt;a data-offer-url="https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/"}' href="https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kenneth Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before, and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse,’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling &lt;em&gt;blergh&lt;/em&gt; at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis—the condition you probably know of as hay fever—and related allergy conditions &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1819793#d1e333"&gt;cost the economy billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153"}' href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Over time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them, as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“If the trend lines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;How We Keep Making Allergies Worse for Ourselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21461-allergic-asthma"&gt;asthma attacks&lt;/a&gt;, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000844.htm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPYzd0NmhyQzZ1VC1fRnJqQkVZQ2dBc192dXJNYU4yTlNkY0lKLTZEcmZxLXhja05NNE9sbWFESTY3UzFRTWhtWElSVzZBZnN0ZnEyTkRZZF9WeHZxTW5mSW14anEzRWdYb2trUDh4ZDNUYml4OGdWOUxaNDRpZ3AtV2pB</guid></item><item><title>Type 2 Diabetes Can Mimic Alzheimer's In The Brain, Per New Study.

After receiving the reward, healthy rodents stopped to savor it, while those with diabetes quickly moved on to the next reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;More specifically, researchers found that levels of insulin (a hormone that helps escort blood sugar into cells) in rats with high blood sugar interfered with the brain’s ability to process information around rewards. It also tamped down on input to the ACC from the hippocampus, which is an area of the brain linked to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Why does this matter? Well, the circuit between the ACC and hippocampus is a key player in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. As a result, symptoms of people with unmanaged high blood sugar can mimic those of early Alzheimer’s disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“This type of muted reward response could help explain why patients with type 2 diabetes have trouble sticking to the lifestyle changes that are part of their treatment regimens,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/james-hyman" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.unlv.edu/people/james-hyman" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Hyman" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;James Hyman&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author and associate professor in the Department of Psychology at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Their brains don't respond to normally rewarding things, like foods and exercise, potentially due to their disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-acc" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What is ACC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;ACC stands for anterior cingulate cortex. It’s a part of the brain that’s linked with fundamental cognitive processes, including motivation, decision making, learning, goal-oriented behavior, pleasure-seeking, and reward-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The ACC also plays a role in regulating emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-type-2-diabetes-change-your-brain" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;How does type 2 diabetes change your brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Type 2 diabetes can impact the brain a few different ways. There is a higher risk of vascular disease, nerve damage, and inflammation in people who have high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://case.edu/medicine/diabetes/about/faculty-and-staff/betul-hatipoglu" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://case.edu/medicine/diabetes/about/faculty-and-staff/betul-hatipoglu" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Betul Ayse Hatipoglu" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Betul Ayse Hatipoglu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an endocrinologist and  professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. All of those can impact the brain and its ability to function normally, she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;High blood glucose levels can also literally alter the size of the brain, as well as change the blood vessels in the brain, says &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-minisha-sood-md-11357607" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-minisha-sood-md-11357607" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Minisha Sood" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Minisha Sood&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an endocrinologist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital. “That can lead to compromised nutrient delivery to brain cells and inflammation and damage the brain,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;High blood sugar levels can also cause cell damage in the brain and “basically accelerate brain aging,” Dr. Sood says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-there-any-way-to-reverse-those-changes" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Is there any way to reverse those changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Scientists don’t know at this point. “It is unclear whether the brain changes from [unmanaged] type 2 diabetes can be fully reversed,” Dr. Sood says. “But it is likely that they can be significantly improved and further progression can be halted with intensive lifestyle changes and control of blood glucose levels through a combination of lifestyle changes and possibly even medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Hatipoglu agrees. “We know improving blood sugar will always help,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Hyman also points out that the rodents in his study had untreated diabetes which led to consistently high blood sugar levels. Chronically high blood sugar is likely “the key to brain-related effects,” he says.

Do your tick checks. Know when your risk is highest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus is primarily transmitted to humans by one of Minnesota’s 13 tick species: the blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick. Symptoms of Powassan include seizures, paralysis, speech difficulties and, in severe infections, meningitis and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 10% to 15% of Powassan virus cases are fatal, and around half of infected individuals sustain long-term neurological problems such as recurring headaches and memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no treatments or vaccines for Powassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It replicates in neurons, and it replicates in cells that are in brain cells, and so through simple destructive processes in the brain, you’re going to have downstream effects that result in these long-term cognitive impacts,” said Matthew Aliota, professor at the University of Minnesota Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences. “Powassan has the capacity to invade the central nervous system, to cross the blood/brain barrier and to infect brain cells, and that can have really bad long-term consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aliota received a $3.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in 2024 to assess the potential public risk of and build a foundational understanding of Powassan, focusing on Minnesota and New York — two of the country’s Powassan epicenters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 54 human cases across 10 states in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This really has been an understudied virus to date, and the number of cases have been increasing over the past, say, 10 to 15 years,” he said. “Some of this is related to better recognition by clinicians, but some of it I think is just ecology as well, a true increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan is often compared to Lyme disease because both are spread by blacklegged ticks, but Aliota says the two are “apples to oranges.” Lyme disease is significantly more common than Powassan and is not a virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_11666608" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="A red rash on a woman's arm." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="11666608" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-OUTDOORS-0406_02.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Undated courtesy photo, circa 2007, of the pathognomonic erythematous rash in the pattern of a bull’s-eye, referred to as erythema migrans. The rash manifested at the site of a tick bite, on this Maryland woman’s arm, signifying a case of Lyme disease. (James Gathany/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is spread by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacteria a tick acquires when feeding on white-footed mice. These comparisons have led some to believe — possibly incorrectly — that the white-footed mouse is also a reservoir for Powassan. It is unknown which tick host animal harbors Powassan; some ticks are also born with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have just assumed that that mouse is the same host for Powassan as well, but we don’t know that,” Aliota said. “That’s one of the questions that my lab is trying to answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for increasing Powassan reports may include more abundant animals for ticks to prey on: white-tailed deer, a favorite host of the blacklegged tick, have larger numbers in the state than in past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, more people may live near deer ticks than compared to a few decades ago. As housing developments are built and expanded, more people encroach on tick habitats. Many suburbs have wooded pockets on their edges, and these forest fragments place ticks close to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It kind of creates this ideal habitat for encounters between humans and this tick species,” Aliota said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase awareness of Powassan, Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologists like Schiffman frequently give presentations to inform health care providers, medical associations and the public about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s about hammering home that messaging like, ‘Well, when we talk about tick-borne diseases, it’s more than just Lyme disease,’” she said. “We talk with providers, ‘Here’s how you find these rare cases, and if you have a person who you can’t figure out what they have, please loop us in at MVH, we’d love to help you sort out what might be causing that person’s illness.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who exhibit mild or no symptoms are less likely to seek testing, and for patients who are tested, the virus’ rarity may lead some doctors to overlook the possibility of Powassan. Most diagnostic labs in the state are unable to screen for Powassan, meaning doctors must send blood work to places like Mayo Clinic or the Minnesota Department of Health for detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with the way that we capture these cases and the way we do surveillance, we’re kind of biased towards the more severe cases,” Schiffman said. “We’re probably missing some of the milder ones, just as an artifact of how that testing is done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bias may extend to the age demographics of infected individuals. More than 70% of cases reported nationally within the past two decades occurred in people age 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also tend to see a lot of people who are older and who have those immunosuppressive conditions in our case population that we report on because they’re also more likely to be the ones who get sicker,” Schiffman said. “If you’re sicker, you’re probably more likely to be tested. So you’re definitely biasing the data in that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health recommends being aware of areas at high risk of tick activity, using Environmental Protection Agency-registered tick repellent (&lt;a href="http://epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you&lt;/a&gt;) and diligently checking the skin and clothing after outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers used eye-tracking technology to compare the visual behavior of adolescents with and without depression during different visual tasks. They found that certain eye movement characteristics were significantly different in adolescents with depression and were associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder often begins during adolescence, a period of intense emotional, social, and cognitive development. Depression in teenagers is not only becoming more common but also tends to recur and interfere with many areas of life, including school, family relationships, and social functioning. In many cases, even when mood symptoms improve with treatment, cognitive difficulties—like trouble with memory, attention, and understanding social cues—can persist. These problems can make it hard for adolescents to return to normal daily activities and may contribute to poor treatment outcomes and higher relapse rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have become interested in using eye-tracking technology as a non-invasive way to study how the brain processes information. Eye movements, including how often people look at certain parts of an image or how well they can follow a moving object, are known to reflect underlying cognitive processes. For example, smooth and coordinated eye movements require good attention control, while frequent or erratic eye movements might indicate difficulty with focus or information processing. Since brain areas involved in eye control also play a role in cognitive functioning, the researchers wanted to explore whether eye movement patterns could serve as indicators of cognitive problems in depressed adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out by researchers at Central South University’s Second Xiangya Hospital in China. They recruited a total of 113 participants aged 12 to 17 years. Of these, 71 had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, while the remaining 42 were healthy adolescents with no psychiatric conditions. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and those with other medical or neurological issues were excluded. The researchers collected demographic information, assessed depression severity using standardized questionnaires, and evaluated cognitive performance using a battery of neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive testing included measures of memory, attention, language, and social reasoning. For example, the Children’s Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Depression Scale were used to evaluate mood symptoms, while the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) measured various areas of cognitive functioning. Social cognition was assessed using a test designed to measure the ability to detect social blunders, known as the faux pas test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye movement data were collected using a high-precision eye tracker that monitored the dominant eye while participants completed two tasks. The first was a free-viewing task, in which participants were shown a series of neutral images—such as landscapes and geometric shapes—for eight seconds each. The second was a smooth pursuit task, which involved tracking a dot moving in a complex sinusoidal pattern across the screen. The researchers measured various aspects of eye movement, including how many times participants looked at different parts of the image (fixation count), how long their eyes remained still (fixation duration), and how fast and far their eyes moved (saccade measures).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the groups, the researchers found several differences in both cognitive functioning and eye movement patterns. Adolescents with depression scored significantly lower on overall cognitive performance, particularly in areas related to immediate memory, attention, and delayed memory. They also performed worse on the faux pas test, suggesting difficulties in understanding social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the free-viewing task, the depressed group showed a smaller average saccade amplitude, meaning their eye movements covered shorter distances as they scanned the images. This could indicate a more restricted or cautious visual exploration pattern. In the smooth pursuit task, which tests the ability to follow moving targets, the depressed group showed more frequent fixations and saccades. These patterns suggest that they may have had difficulty smoothly tracking the moving object and had to compensate with more frequent adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the study came from the correlations between eye movement variables and cognitive test scores. In the group with depression, some specific eye movement characteristics were linked to better or worse cognitive performance. For example, more frequent fixations were associated with better immediate memory, while longer fixation durations were linked to poorer memory. Faster eye movements and longer saccade durations were connected with better attention and memory. One measure—the number of saccades in a complex background tracking task—was also positively associated with better performance on the faux pas test, suggesting that how adolescents scan visual scenes may reflect how well they can understand social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations were not observed in the healthy group, indicating that the eye movement patterns seen in the depressed group may reflect compensatory strategies or underlying difficulties specific to the condition. For instance, adolescents with depression may rely on faster or more frequent eye movements to make up for cognitive limitations, particularly in tasks that require sustained attention or memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds to growing evidence that eye-tracking can serve as a useful tool for understanding how depression affects the brain and behavior. It also highlights the potential for using eye movement data as part of clinical assessments, especially for detecting subtle cognitive deficits that might not be apparent through traditional interviews or questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study has several limitations. All of the participants with depression were already receiving treatment, so it is unclear how medications may have influenced their cognitive functioning or eye movements. The groups also differed in age and gender distribution, which could affect the results. Additionally, the tasks used were relatively simple and involved neutral images, which might not fully capture how adolescents with depression respond to more emotionally charged or socially complex situations. The cross-sectional design also limits the ability to determine whether eye movement abnormalities cause cognitive problems, result from them, or develop alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future studies should explore these relationships using more varied tasks, longitudinal designs, and possibly treatment-naive patients. They also emphasize the need to refine eye movement tests to better capture the unique features of adolescent cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2024.111914" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The association between eye movement characteristics and cognitive function in adolescents with major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yuanyuan Lu, Lintong Song, Chunxiang Huang, Tianqing Fan, Jinqiao Huang, Leyin Zhang, Xuerong Luo, Yanhua Li, and Yanmei Shen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:05:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNbWQ2NTBQUVRGWC1raGpMY1hNVWdBX2VPZzd2R2thclRkdWE3QjJ5Vk53OTlrRmJBa3RnSGMtWFdiQTNRX0tSZEVEMXR1Yk9Tdk5fN1JUUEdoaXA2dGk3OWVMSnA3Y2tLZ3JQdHFNTEEwRXlKc3pKa2ktSU1pOHZzSXZJTFZmWnVaWk5POTF0SldMelhRTW5QTkdBbmNMY2FyZXlhR2UtdTFORkRhOElUdm43MmZHNkdlR1NwSg</guid></item><item><title>An unusual gut bacteria can help prevent obesity.

While some of these microbes cause illness and disease (such as bacteria and viruses), others are friendlier to us and help keep us in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is one of these friendly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for years that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is associated with good health. One of the important roles it plays in our gut is maintaining the function of our gut barrier. This keeps the bad bugs out while making sure we can still absorb the important nutrients from our diet that keep our cells working as they should. But when there’s an imbalance of &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in the gut, it can lead to problems with our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual bacteria lives in our large intestine and survives off of mucin — the layer of mucus that covers the large intestine’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucin provides a small but important separation between the human cells and microbial cells that call the large intestine home. If this mucus layer is disrupted, microbes can come into direct contact with the human cells. This may result in inflammation as the human cells react to the bacteria – potentially leading to the development of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is a very fussy eater. It only uses the glycoproteins (molecules containing protein and carbohydrates) in mucin as an energy source. But just how this bacteria extracted energy from glycoproteins was a mystery until recently. Research conducted by myself and colleagues discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; deploys a range of different enzymes that work together in order to unlock the sugar found in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mucin taken from a pig, we analysed both enzyme activity on the surface of cells alongside their genes to understand which enzymes were involved in breaking the glycoproteins in mucin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; uses 66 different enzymes to extract the important energy it needs from the glycoproteins in order to do its important work. We are the first group to describe this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Important for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila’s&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the immune system in mice have revealed that it calms the immune system down and may prevent obesity and diabetes from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have highlighted specific peptides (a type of molecule) that it secretes which have this effect on the immune system. Due to its friendly nature and calming effect on the immune system, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; has even been used to develop probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also found that people who have a metabolic disease, such as diabetes or fatty liver disease, have fewer &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in their large intestine. The more lean and athletic you are, the more &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; only eats mucus, our diet does still affect it – though indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon-dwelling bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; use the carbohydrates they extract from the fibre-rich foods in our diet as fuel. In return they produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These compounds feed the top layer of human cells in the colon. In fact, 10 per cent of our energy comes from this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hHPRtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The bacteria lives in the large intestine" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-4345"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;The bacteria lives in the large intestine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; also supports other bacterial species in the microbiome by giving them broken-up mucus so they can survive – a process known as “cross feeding”. But, if we don’t eat enough fibre as part of our diet, mucins become a much more heavily used source of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to the depletion of the large intestine’s mucus layer – throwing the microbiome’s delicate ecosystem out of balance. This increases the chance of developing inflammatory diseases. So, although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is not a pathogen, it can remove too much mucus under the wrong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research is the first complete example of how mucus is broken down by this bacterial species. It’s important to understand this process, as it’s key in the way our microbes interact with each other – and with us. The enzymes that we described from &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; can now also be used as tools to analyse how these complex mucin structures vary across different body sites and between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more researchers learn about &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; and the other microbes that live in the colon, the more we understand the importance of eating a variable, high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Crouch is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection, Department of Microbes, Infection and Microbiomes, School of Infection, Inflammation and Immunology, College of Medicine and Health at University of Birmingham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Other vitamin A derivatives like retinol are weaker because your skin must convert them before they’re recognizable as retinoic acid. Tretinoin’s strength translates into glowier, healthier-looking skin faster, but the ingredient is not without its weaknesses. “Tretinoin often causes dryness, peeling, and redness due to increased skin-cell turnover,” says double-board-certified facial plastic surgeon &lt;a data-offer-url="https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/"}' href="https://facialplasticsbh.com/resources/our-team/meet-dr-azizzadeh/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Babak Azizzadeh&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people wrongly think they are allergic or stop using it for these reasons.” These side effects are often known as the retinoid uglies, and they can be challenging, but they’re not insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to succeeding when using all-star all-trans retinoic acid is consistency, patience, and caution—and following a tretinoin skin-care routine designed to support your skin as it adjusts to the potent active. With these steps and our expert tips, you’ll be well on your way to revealing your freshest, brightest skin yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your Evening Tretinoin Skin-Care Routine Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretinoin can make your skin more sensitive, especially to sun exposure, so you’ll want to apply it as part of your evening routine. Dr. Reszko recommends following an evening routine focusing on repair, hydration, and supporting the skin’s overnight regenerative processes. “Combining tretinoin with growth factors, reparative ingredients, and gentle hydration will help restore the skin barrier, minimize irritation, and promote healthy skin renewal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Prep the Skin With Cleanser&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always start with a fresh canvas. By washing your face, you’ll be removing any makeup, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-sunscreens"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, or other residues that will prevent the tretinoin from fully absorbing into your skin. Our experts recommend using a gentle, hydrating formula that won’t strip the skin barrier and leave you dry but fully removes any grime. Ideally, it’ll also be fragrance-free to avoid irritation; you’ll want your skin to be as comfortable as possible before applying tretinoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK dlcjCj grid

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a Pea-Size Amount of Tretinoin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve patted your skin dry post-cleanse, apply a pea-size amount of tretinoin to your face, avoiding your eyes, mouth, and any broken skin. A pea-size amount may sound like a comically small dab of product, but we promise that is truly all you need to get the benefits of tretinoin. “Be careful not to over-apply, as more product doesn’t necessarily mean better results,” warns Dr. Reszko. Allow the tretinoin to absorb for a few minutes before you move on to the next step, which will give it time to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a Skin-Renewing Serum&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’re getting your beauty rest, your body is hard at work fixing any damage from the day. Make the most of it by using a repair serum after your tretinoin.

No matter your reason for using a retinoid, don’t have it in your regimen if you’re not going to use sunscreen too. “Sun protection is crucial while using tretinoin since it increases sun sensitivity and makes your skin more prone to burning and damage,” warns Dr. Reszko, who recommends seeking out a broad-spectrum formula (which will protect you from both UVA and UVB rays) that’s at least SPF 30, if not greater for added protection. Dr. Azizzadeh recommends mineral SPF in particular, as it’s gentler on the skin than chemical filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK dlcjCj grid grid-even grid-items-2 GroupCalloutWrapper-bPWknp hzPUPi callout callout--group callout--group-2"&gt;&lt;div class="GridItem-buujkM dEqBaI grid--item"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/ABAm9JTY78wqUMwcwcSjpMWCTdk3MJnSPww1XrDm7dTh9Efg6fBAFzC72kJuhAg4Ca7PkwAjhRPabrmvipZ4Gz2SEA5yBnMWAmszBRgshHH5WCcoAb4jgiea2jSZCd6wtYPkbJ2RNMmb3Yr1Xk3xi7xx1QPAJtkPMQCqYooMG4KQZvyCwGKNaijXXKBLqRZwFr9sMLc5t6McYZpEysK8v2d76WHpsYzQeSxjY1HfG4stsxcDGyBLvrYq1mZhud7mieZ1MgtrZxRHfMkGRnGip4i3JwqQ1YSBEMW23BWF5Wa7DE9m1pbme2WwPK4SpDo7HzKfG9RTi8SvD4Nr","dangerousDek":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This &amp;lt;a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/best-tinted-sunscreen\"&amp;gt;tinted mineral SPF formula&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; automatically adjusts to your skin tone, offering dewy coverage that’s comparable to a light-to-medium buildable foundation while treating your skin to soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide, bisabolol, and green-tea extract.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n","productBrand":"Skinbetter","dangerousHed":"Sunbetter Tone Smart SPF 75 Sunscreen Lotion","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"SKINBETTER","offerUrl":"https://www.skinbetter.com/technology-platforms/sunbetter/sunbetter-tone-smart-spf-75-sunscreen-lotion-M025.html","contentType":"product","productId":"67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":14,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e","brand":{"name":"Skinbetter"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.skinbetter.com/technology-platforms/sunbetter/sunbetter-tone-smart-spf-75-sunscreen-lotion-M025.html","price":"$75","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/ABAm9JTY78wqUMwcwcSjpMWCTdk3MJnSPww1XrDm7dTh9Efg6fBAFzC72kJuhAg4Ca7PkwAjhRPabrmvipZ4Gz2SEA5yBnMWAmszBRgshHH5WCcoAb4jgiea2jSZCd6wtYPkbJ2RNMmb3Yr1Xk3xi7xx1QPAJtkPMQCqYooMG4KQZvyCwGKNaijXXKBLqRZwFr9sMLc5t6McYZpEysK8v2d76WHpsYzQeSxjY1HfG4stsxcDGyBLvrYq1mZhud7mieZ1MgtrZxRHfMkGRnGip4i3JwqQ1YSBEMW23BWF5Wa7DE9m1pbme2WwPK4SpDo7HzKfG9RTi8SvD4Nr","sellerName":"SKINBETTER","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Skinbetter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67ed48eac5b57c0943e7c68e" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Sunbetter Tone Smart SPF 75 Sunscreen Lotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardDescriptionWrapper-dDTcJP iUEiRd dIcbna hHSuFw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-tinted-sunscreen"&gt;tinted mineral SPF formula&lt;/a&gt; automatically adjusts to your skin tone, offering dewy coverage that’s comparable to a light-to-medium buildable foundation while treating your skin to soothing, anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide, bisabolol, and green-tea extract.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re new to retinoids and/or have sensitive skin, start with a low concentration, ideally with a cream base. A lower potency and a more nourishing base will help your skin adjust to the tretinoin and minimize the common side effects of irritation, dryness, redness, and peeling. “If you have dry or sensitive skin, your physician will likely recommend staying with a lower concentration,” says Dr. Azizzadeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use a 0.025% tretinoin without irritation for four or six weeks, have oily skin, or are a seasoned retinoid user, you can try a stronger formula; 0.05% will provide stronger antiaging and acne-clearing results, while 0.1% tretinoin will provide even more powerful benefits against deeper wrinkles or severe acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to monitor your skin as you start a new formula, advises Dr. Reszko. “If you notice irritation or excessive dryness, you may need to reduce the frequency or go back to a lower concentration for a while before moving up again,” she says. “The goal is to maximize benefits while keeping side effects to a minimum.” No matter what, side effects are likely, but don’t let that deter you; just take them as a sign you need to adjust your treatment, either in strength, application cadence (more on this below), or both. “You’re using a real prescription treatment,” says Dr. Bottiglione. “Education about the product you’re using is extremely important so you can learn how to modify the treatment to suit you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="beforeorafter" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do You Apply Tretinoin Before or After Moisturizer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will depend on your skin type as well as your tolerance to tretinoin. “If you apply a moisturizer first then put the tretinoin on, the moisturizer will act as a barrier and you will not get the full results from the treatment,” warns Dr. Bottiglione. However, creating a buffer can be helpful if you have dry or sensitive skin, says Dr. Azizzadeh, who advises these skin types to try the retinoin-sandwich technique: two thin layers of moisturizer as the bread, filled with tretinoin. You’ll still absorb some of the tretinoin, but you won’t be getting it at its maximum strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="notlayer" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Should You Not Layer With Tretinoin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tretinoin sensitizes the skin, so you’ll want to avoid ingredients and products that can cause further irritation. This includes strong exfoliants like AHAs, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-bha-exfoliants"&gt;BHAs&lt;/a&gt;, and physical scrubs; potent actives such as benzoyl peroxide, hydroquinone, and kojic acid; and harsh or drying ingredients like alcohol-based astringents, toners, and clay masks, says Dr. Azizzadeh. You also shouldn’t use other retinoids (including &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-bakuchiol-serums"&gt;bakuchiol&lt;/a&gt;) with tretinoin; this will just add irritation without additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still keep exfoliants or other actives in your regimen using tretinoin. “You can use tretinoin and strong exfoliants on alternating nights,” says Dr. Azizzadeh. “Similarly, potent actives can be used on the same day as tretinoin, with the active ingredients applied in the morning and tretinoin in the evening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="howoften" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Often Should You Use Tretinoin per Week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less really is more with tretinoin, especially if you’re a new user. “Begin by applying tretinoin two to three nights a week for the first two to four weeks,” says Dr. Reszko. “This allows your skin to build tolerance while still reaping the benefits of increased cell turnover.” If your skin has adapted after a few weeks and you no longer have much irritation, you can increase your application to every other night or four to five times a week. Those with sensitive, reactive, or rosacea-prone skin should be especially aware of irritation. “If you notice irritation or dryness when you increase the frequency, reduce it back to two to three times a week until your skin fully adjusts,” says Dr. Reszko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently clear, smooth, and irritation-free skin while using tretinoin is a sign that you can take things to the next level. “If you are an advanced user and your skin fully tolerates tretinoin, you can apply it every night to maximize its benefits for acne, antiaging, and skin-texture improvement,” says Dr. Azzizadeh. Just be aware that your skin won’t be ready for this overnight; patiently building your skin’s tolerance is key to achieving the best results with the least irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meettheexperts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE55anV1OS1YdXB1LWNGVGhUTkVNdWZyaGxiUmcxWFVtNHdVZl9fekVVcHVwbTNtWmNpeW9od3JtcEZ6VGlhbDRwMmhrNVV3UXc1TUVyZU1hLUc3RnZxSFhINVR2RnJKdzQ</guid></item><item><title>New Study Reveals Just 10 Days of Inactivity Can Harm Your Brain - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWFZDQlNLUFY5UVZqdXNiYnBCTjJsY1JGMGYyZXk4dVY5QmFEWF9TQ0lOS01wVmM1SnpmYTgybHlaak9qekl1VGltRzNFVVR5dzVoZVVwdm1lRnlNOGF3RXl6WjBpbDZjNDBUTG9OREMtRHQtcnpndjNhWlRfV2U1aXVqTER5ZlJkbUtIdGVhcUduNHQ4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 09:47:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWFZDQlNLUFY5UVZqdXNiYnBCTjJsY1JGMGYyZXk4dVY5QmFEWF9TQ0lOS01wVmM1SnpmYTgybHlaak9qekl1VGltRzNFVVR5dzVoZVVwdm1lRnlNOGF3RXl6WjBpbDZjNDBUTG9OREMtRHQtcnpndjNhWlRfV2U1aXVqTER5ZlJkbUtIdGVhcUduNHQ4</guid></item><item><title>I spent 3 nights in a secluded lodge in Italy's Dolomites.

We could call room service when hungry and spend the day admiring the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was tempting, but we headed downstairs to explore the spa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we considered never leaving the suite, exiting the spa was even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the 21,500-square-foot spa was the most impressive pool I've ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the pool had views of the Dolomites. Half of it was indoors, and the other was outdoors. Guests could swim between the two through sliding glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area also had loungers, daybeds, a water station with small snacks, a sauna, and a steam room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallway led to another wing of the spa, which had two more indoor saunas, one at 185 degrees Fahrenheit and another at 158 degrees. There was a cold plunge, a silent room with a fireplace, and a tea lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A door led outdoors to the fifth sauna, which was tucked inside a traditional South Tyrolean wooden house, and a second outdoor cold plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While access to these amenities is included in the stay, the property's spa also offers treatments like massages, facials, scrubs, and manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When she saw photos of the characteristic red rash on practice board exams, she flipped back through her textbooks to figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Most practicing doctors, in today’s day and age, are not going to see it in real life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in the past few months, Dr. Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, has treated about 20 people with measles. She is likely to see more cases, as a raging outbreak that has infected 481 people in Texas and killed one child continues to spread. In Texas, New Mexico and other parts of the country where cases have emerged,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;health care workers like Dr. Myrick are confronting the highly contagious virus for the first time. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported 607 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. this year — more than double the number of cases seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The generation of physicians who are currently, for the most part, treating patients haven’t actually seen what a measles case looks like other than from a textbook or a video,” said Dr. Andy Lubell, chief medical officer of True North Pediatrics in Pennsylvania, where a physician diagnosed the practice’s first ever measles case this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000. Cases still pop up around the country each year, sometimes seeding larger outbreaks. But public health experts worry that this year, measles could become &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/health/measles-outbreak-texas.html" title=""&gt;more common in more places.&lt;/a&gt; The virus is spreading rapidly in some parts of the country, and vaccination rates nationwide have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" title=""&gt;been falling for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I remember learning about measles, German measles, all these things,” said Dr. Seth Coombs, a doctor at the Lovington Medical Clinic in New Mexico who saw his first measles case this year. “But you just don’t see them. And so like anything, if you don’t use it, you lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can sometimes be hard to recognize at first, especially if a doctor doesn’t think to look for it. The infection causes a telltale red rash, but it can take days to appear. Before that, someone with measles might have only a fever, cough, a runny nose and red, watery eyes — symptoms that mimic the signs of many other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of New Mexico researchers studying the health risks posed by gadolinium, a toxic rare earth metal used in MRI scans, have found that oxalic acid, a molecule found in many foods, can generate nanoparticles of the metal in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/i&gt;, a team led by Brent Wagner, MD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine in the UNM School of Medicine, sought to explain the formation of the nanoparticles, which have been associated with serious health problems in the kidneys and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The worst disease caused by MRI contrast agents is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," he said. "People have succumbed after just a single dose." The condition can cause a thickening and hardening of the skin, heart and lungs and cause painful contracture of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected prior to MRI scans to help create sharper images, Wagner said. The metal is usually tightly bound to other molecules and is excreted from the body, and most people experience no adverse effects. However, previous research has shown that even in those with no symptoms, gadolinium particles have been found in the kidney and the brain and can be detected in the blood and urine years after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are left with intertwined puzzles: Why do some people get sick, when most don't, and how do gadolinium particles become pried loose from the other molecules in the contrast agent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost 50% of the patients had been exposed only a single time, which means that there's something that is amplifying the disease signal," Wagner said. "This nanoparticle formation might explain a few things. It might explain why there's such an amplification of the disease. When a cell is trying to deal with this alien metallic nanoparticle within it, it's going to send out signals that tell the body to respond to it."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In their study, Wagner's team focused on oxalic acid, which is found in many plant-based foods, including spinach, rhubarb, most nuts and berries and chocolate, because it binds with metal ions. The process helps lead to the formation of kidney stones, which result when oxalate binds with calcium. Meanwhile, oxalic acid also forms in the body when people eat foods or supplements containing vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In test tube experiments the researchers found that oxalic acid caused minute amounts of gadolinium to precipitate out of the contrast agent and form nanoparticles, which then infiltrated the cells of various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some people might form these things, while others do not, and it may be their metabolic milieu," Wagner said. "It might be if they were in a high oxalic state or a state where molecules are more prone to linking to the gadolinium, leading to the formation of the nanoparticles. That might be why some individuals have such awful symptoms and this massive disease response, whereas other people are fine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding points to a possible way to mitigate some of the risks associated with MRI scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't take vitamin C if I needed to have an MRI with contrast because of the reactivity of the metal," Wagner said. "I'm hoping that we're getting closer to some recommendations for helping these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now researching ways to identify those who might be at greatest risk from gadolinium contrast agents. In a new study they're building an international patient registry that will include a collection of blood, urine, fingernail and hair samples, which could provide evidence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gadolinium/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gadolinium&lt;/a&gt; accumulation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to get a lot more information to come up with the risk factors that relate to those with symptoms," he said. "We're going to ask about what medical conditions you had at the time of exposure, what medications are you on, and we want to include &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+supplements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;, because that might piece it all together—why some people have symptoms, whereas others seem to be impervious."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's interconnected world, infectious diseases pose an escalating threat, as demonstrated by the coronavirus pandemic and outbreaks of H1N1, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and H5N1 (bird flu) viruses—all of which have had significant global health and economic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;But more common viral diseases also contribute to global health challenges and economic costs. For example, seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually, causing a substantial global disease burden and economic losses exceeding $11.2 billion each year in the United States alone. Meanwhile, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), spread primarily through oral contact, infects over two-thirds of the global population and is the leading cause of infectious blindness in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low vaccination rates for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza+viruses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;influenza viruses&lt;/a&gt; and the lack of an HSV vaccine underscore the need for a new approach—one that targets reducing viral loads at the sites where transmission occurs. And for viruses like these, which are transmitted more efficiently through the mouth than the nose, this means focusing on the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and collaborators in Finland, have done just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-12-gum-sars-cov-transmission.html"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt;—now in &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/news-events/2022/09/08/chewing-gum-designed-to-trap-sars-cov-2-in-the-saliva-moves-to-clinical-trial-from-dr-henry-daniells-lab/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;—showing that a similar approach was able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient saliva or swab samples by more than 95%, Henry Daniell, W.D. Miller Professor in Penn's School of Dental Medicine, and collaborators tested the ability of a chewing gum made from lablab beans, &lt;i&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/i&gt;—that naturally contain an antiviral trap protein (FRIL)—to neutralize two herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2). The chewing gum formulation allowed for effective and consistent release of FRIL at sites of viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They demonstrated that 40 milligrams of a two-gram bean gum tablet was adequate to reduce viral loads by more than 95%, a reduction similar to what they saw in their SARS-CoV-2 study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers prepared the gum as a clinical-grade drug product to comply with the FDA specifications for drug products and found the gum to be safe. Daniell notes, "These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniell and his colleagues are now looking to use lablab bean powder to tackle bird flu, which is currently having a significant impact in North America. In the previous three months, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;54 million birds&lt;/a&gt; have been affected by H5N1, and several human infections have been reported in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720310019?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;bean powder was shown&lt;/a&gt; by others to effectively neutralize H5N1 and H7N9—two strains of influenza A known to cause bird flu in humans as well as in birds. Daniell and colleagues are currently looking to test its use in bird feed to help control &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bird+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be major global challenge. A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission," says Daniell.&lt;/p&gt;
