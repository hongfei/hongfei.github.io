Doctors have long tried to understand whether caffeine — which can increase heart rate and blood pressure — appears to trigger episodes that feel like a fluttering or thumping in the chest and cause dizziness or breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbbede" class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no standard advice for atrial fibrillation and caffeine,” said Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841253" target="_blank"&gt;DECAF (Does Eliminating Coffee Avoid Fibrillation?) study&lt;/a&gt;. “It is very common for me to encounter patients who have stopped drinking caffeinated coffee only because their physician has told them to do so because of their atrial fibrillation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d85e00" class="body-graf"&gt;The results of the DECAF study, a four-year clinical trial examining the effects of drinking coffee in people with a history of irregular heart rhythm that had either resolved or been treated, were presented Sunday at the annual American Heart Association conference in New Orleans and published in JAMA. Marcus is an associate editor of JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5eea" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers recruited 200 older adults in Australia, Canada and the United States who were regular coffee drinkers at some point in the last five years. The average age was 70 and one-third were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0255ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Over six months, the participants were randomized to two groups: those who cut out caffeine, and those who had at least one cup every day. Everyone self-reported their coffee and caffeinated beverage consumption during telehealth or video check-ins that occurred one, three and six months into the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3bbf2" class="body-graf"&gt;Using data from electrocardiograms, or ECGs, taken in a doctor’s office, wearable heart monitors and implantable cardiac devices, Marcus and his team determined if and when people in each group had their first recurrent episode of A-fib. They included episodes of atrial flutter, a related condition that also causes abnormal contractions in the upper chambers of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7e8f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Both groups had about the same alcohol habits. Not everyone was a coffee drinker when the study began, but the number of daily coffee drinkers in each group was similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2edc89" class="body-graf"&gt;Before the study began, 60% of people in the coffee-drinking group and 65% in the no-coffee group said that coffee had never triggered an A-fib episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bde158" class="body-graf"&gt;During the six-month study, 111 people, or 56%, had a recurrent episode of atrial flutter. People in the coffee drinking group were less likely to have a recurrence — 47% compared to 64% of people in the no-coffee group — and went a longer period of time before they had their first episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c0dea" class="body-graf"&gt;(About a third of people in the no-coffee group did admit to drinking at least a cup during the study, while the rest didn’t consume any.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-429aeb" class="body-heading"&gt;A cup a day 'perfectly safe'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dccae" class="body-graf"&gt;It's the latest study to show coffee may lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coffee-tea-caffeine-heart-metabolic-disease-lower-risk-rcna171354" target="_blank"&gt;heart problems and other metabolic disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4bac3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Previous observational research has suggested that people who drank coffee had less of a risk of A-fib, but the new trial shows a cause-and-effect relationship, said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84288f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was somewhat surprised at the magnitude of how protective caffeinated coffee does seem to be to prevent atrial fibrillation,” Marcus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-649d75" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Johanna Contreras, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York, said the most significant takeaway from the study was that drinking a cup of coffee a day seems to be perfectly safe for people with A-fib, rather than that coffee is protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-068b2b" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s not a hard-and-fast rule. Not everyone has the same reaction to caffeine,” said Contreras, who was not involved with the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89ff26" class="body-graf"&gt;There are notable limitations in the study, including the effects of caffeinated beverages other than coffee. The trial didn’t track differences in exercise habits or diet. People who drink coffee may also be exercising more, Marcus suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce1486" class="body-graf"&gt;The study found that drinking just one cup of coffee per day appeared to have a protective effect, and while some people in the study did drink more than that, it’s unclear if &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/much-coffee-much-four-experts-weigh-rcna99847" target="_blank"&gt;more than a cup of coffee per day &lt;/a&gt;could have any effect on A-fib recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dbca8" class="body-graf"&gt;Moderation is key, Contreras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d22b87" class="body-graf"&gt;“If people are having six or seven cups of coffee, and then Red Bulls and Celsius, that’s different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dbcb9" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear why drinking coffee was linked with a lower risk of irregular heartbeat recurrence. It’s possible that an anti-inflammatory compound in coffee, not specifically caffeine, could have reduced recurrence in the coffee-drinking group, Marcus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c048e" class="body-graf"&gt;If caffeine is at play, it is possible that stimulating the body’s adrenaline response with caffeine could help stave off A-fib. People often report episodes when they are relaxed, such as while sleeping or after a big meal, when adrenaline is low, Marcus said, when the “rest and digest” part of the nervous system is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-689bcf" class="body-graf"&gt;Also, the trial included only people who were not currently experiencing episodes of A-fib. The findings may not translate to people with the unmanaged disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f4e87" class="body-graf"&gt;“If someone was in the midst of A-fib, caffeine could certainly increase the pulse rate during that episode and therefore lead to worse symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-755d84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For people who are already regular coffee drinkers, “this shows you can have a cup of coffee in the morning and be OK if you have A-fib,” Contreras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORXQzR0RVV1J0WFFncVJsb3ZZMm15MFhfb2FXYThUTy10ODRUQjlBUkI4ajJBbmxzTVlQRkl3SXA1OFpQTW9JeUlUOGdhd0xObnNOMmpnUlJKWHd4VVh2QTF2WGtmdDBxVDRXeWRVX0RoTFVUam1oOWNMdklOSzMwU3Zic0x3VV95RTNpTGpMR1ZKT01fRkRJbVQ4SXhIRkdKVGllcWF30gFWQVVfeXFMUFpmUmJrSXY2dmowaUVkLTJ2TmFreEt5X2V2ektrcmF0SUlmMEhNLXhjUVJkMVdZU3dJenpHYk04REt4X0dTMkMyLUd0Z2UzZjgyRFprZnc</guid></item><item><title>有希望的阿尔茨海默病预防临床试验- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/promising-clinical-trials-in-alzheimers-prevention/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I just know that my brain's not right," said Carrie Richardson, 44. "And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. "I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44," she said … including her son, Bryan, who died last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-small"&gt;

                  &lt;span class="embed__caption"&gt;Carrie Richardson, 44, inherited a genetic mutation that caused early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She's participating in an Alzheimer's research study at Washington University School of Medicine. &lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. "It's the least I can do to help," said Hannah. "I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, "Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques – the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed," Bateman said. "It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: "If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. "In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia," Bateman said. "And we know about when they're going to get it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"A death sentence"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. "Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was "a death sentence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. "I was at an age where I should have been showing signs," Heinrichs said, "and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. "Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's budget cuts have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientists-fear-trump-administration-nih-cuts-could-impact-health-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. "It's a precarious time," he said. "Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby … if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Let's double-down on this disease"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. "The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago," he said. "So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. "I'm going to stay very involved in this," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. "It's quite up in the air," Gates said. "If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. "He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care," said Gates. "But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And – surprise – he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. "AI is going to impact everything we do," he said. "The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could people be tested now? Bateman said, "Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bateman said, "If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science – and a leap of faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-large"&gt;

When she first pulled the pan from the oven, a thick layer of oil wriggled at the top. My brother, father and I playfully jabbed at it with our fingers, giggling as Mom rolled her eyes and scraped the oil off into the trash before dropping it on the table with an annoyed thump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dinner started and we filled our plates, we traded glances with one another and begrudgingly took scoops of the potatoes, lifting small bites to our mouths with reservation to make Mom happy. But as we ate, Dad sat back in discomfort, lips pressed, looking down at the food he’d hardly touched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been signs prior ― indigestion and aches in his abdomen. That January, we had taken a family trip to Mexico, and most days he’d return to the room early to lie down. At the buffets, he’d turn up his nose, nauseated. For months his appetite would wane and he’d feel uncomfortable, but we figured it was because it was flu season, or he was traveling or something was wrong with the food. So maybe those awful potatoes were upsetting him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month after Easter, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year that followed, Dad stepped into his treatment with hope and resolve. He’d crack jokes with the staff that administered his chemo, forgot about the port in his chest and would walk talkative laps with us in the hospital ward when he needed stents in his kidneys. But over time, the disease gathered strength and pulled more from him. He lost weight, lost hair and, eventually, he lost faith that he would beat the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day he was diagnosed, I had flown home from Chicago and entered into a silent pact with myself. I would never break in front of him. I wouldn’t let my fear and anger become a burden and give him more to bear. On the way home, I hid in a dirty bathroom stall, sobbing gently so no one would hear me. I nodded politely at airline attendants and hid my puffy eyes behind sunglasses. I collapsed into my mother’s arms upon arrival ― breathless, afraid my legs would give out ― and cried all the way to the hospital in an effort to exorcise my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we went inside and I saw Dad for the first time, I gave myself no choice but to temper the anxious fluttering in my chest. For the next year, I took solace in the shadowed corners of hospital hallways when he’d return there, symptoms flaring, but would go back to his room with a smile on my face. At home, I’d retreat to the bathroom to soothe the red gathering in my eyes or release my rage by throwing things in the basement. Then, once I’d pulled myself together, I’d sit beside him to swap jokes and tell favorite old stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author visiting her father at work.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 10 months into his treatment when I finally broke in front of him, and he revealed the surprising yet profound truth he was using to guide his way through his diagnosis. It was a warm spring afternoon, and I sat across from Dad in the living room where the sun poured in. Our conversation moved from everyday chatter to the latest news about his treatments, his progress, the food he could still stomach and what might be next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I approached all of it ― no matter how bleak ― with optimism. I looked for a kernel of hope even where there appeared to be none. But Dad thwarted me with his steadfast practicality and the reality I couldn’t avoid. “I’m sick, dear,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the anger swell in my throat ― attempting to manifest itself in words between the tears I’d long held back ― when I finally asked the question we often do when faced with the bleakest of circumstances: Why? Why him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked back at me calmly and then said something I’ll never forget: “Why not me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why not me. &lt;/em&gt;Three little words leveled the room and then hung there definitively, filling the space between us like a fog. Even in the thick of his suffering, he could so clearly see and accept what most people never do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why my father? Why my friend? Why my spouse? Why my child? Why do bad things happen to undeserving people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tragedy is personal, it feels anything but random, and we desperately try to find a reason to make it feel less so. To place blame. But Dad didn’t do anything to get cancer ― it just happened. This realization meant accepting the absolute absence of reason. Cancer ― and other terrible, unthinkable things ― doesn’t happen to everyone but can, in fact, happen to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, just shy of one year after Dad was diagnosed, we lost him to colon cancer. My grief has lingered since then like a mild, disorienting fever I carry every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these last seven years, I’ve watched colon cancer gather strength. I’ve seen more headlines about how it’s upended more lives. I’ve read more disheartening facts about how more people are battling it or losing their lives to it. March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and I can’t help but look back on those three words and how they offer invaluable wisdom ― and a way to put Dad’s perspective into practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" American Cancer Society" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69109a65e4b0853433847620" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths.

I take constant inventory of my health, and I hope my family’s story may motivate others to do the same. I can’t say that things would have turned out differently if Dad had been screened or had seen a doctor earlier about his symptoms, but the not knowing ― the chance that he might have been saved ― is a question that will claw inside of me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, Dad’s realization ― “Why not me?” ― wasn’t just about his sickness, and it has taught me more than just to prioritize my health. It has also inspired me to live a fuller life. Chance invites risk, but it also invites reward. Dad reminded me to be careful when I can and where I should, but also to believe in myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this, I’ve discovered I can take impassioned leaps and land somewhere I never thought possible. Whether it’s pursuing my love of writing or moving to new places, it’s helpful to remember that we don’t know what great things can happen unless we try. Dad’s words have helped me experience incredible moments and do things that I may not have otherwise done because... why not me? Why shouldn’t I reach for all of the things I want? Why shouldn’t I pursue all the things Dad would want for me ― and that he would be so happy to see me achieve if he were here? Maybe those three words were his final guiding lesson, and it’s one that has given me the strength to live a life he would be proud of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden campaign-cta"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Tide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Has Turned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;Cut through the chaos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans just sent Trump a clear message — and Dems are calling it "a 5-alarm fire" for the president.

&lt;p id="193cd2fa-67d6-4a1c-a7b1-b92715bca56e"&gt;Scientists have reported the discovery of the first in a promising new class of antibiotics — and the find was unexpected, as they hadn't set out to find new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new antibiotic compound shows promising activity against drug-resistant infections, including methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vre/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/vre/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, germs that are notorious for causing resistant infections in hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="193cd2fa-67d6-4a1c-a7b1-b92715bca56e-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The discovery of the novel molecule, called pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was reported Oct. 27 the&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c12501" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c12501" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and "can be considered the first in a new class" of antibiotics, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/challis/challisgroup" target="_blank" data-url="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/challis/challisgroup" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lona Alkhalaf and Greg Challis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chemists and lead authors of the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c2bfb7e4-20db-4333-8f91-9d5b7513f70c"&gt;However, the team's initial aim wasn't to discover new drugs. Instead,the researchers were investigating how a known antibiotic, methylenomycin A, gets made by a soil-dwelling bacterium called &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants and microorganisms produce a host of complex compounds known as secondary metabolites, many of which happen to have useful medicinal properties in humans. Understanding how these compounds are made within these organisms and how they interact with human cells can help scientists develop effective drugs from these natural products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blueprints for producing these different biological molecules are held in specific collections of genes, called "biosynthetic gene clusters." By deleting individual genes from these clusters, Alkhalaf and Challis could remove specific enzymes involved in the synthesis of methylenomycin A. This research technique enabled them to halt the reaction sequence at key points to study it more closely — and it led them to spot extract previously unobserved intermediate compounds that get produced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic approach allowed the team to isolate two never-before-seen molecules, which they named pre-methylenomycin C and pre-methylenomycin C lactone. After using an array of techniques to thoroughly characterize the structures of these compounds, they investigated the molecules' biological activity against a panel of bacterial strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pAf9HhoDbzTZqwYvJ83wh9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pAf9HhoDbzTZqwYvJ83wh9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-methylenomycin C lactone proved particularly promising. "[It] is active against a range of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-s-the-difference-between-gram-positive-and-gram-negative-bacteria" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-s-the-difference-between-gram-positive-and-gram-negative-bacteria"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gram-positive bacteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) and a multidrug-resistant strain of &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt;," Challis and Alkhalaf told Live Science. "[It] is 100x better at killing drug-resistant bacteria than the original antibiotic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more importantly, the new compound doesn’t appear to induce antibiotic resistance in the treated strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure to antibiotics can trigger the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-fast-can-antibiotic-resistance-evolve" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/how-fast-can-antibiotic-resistance-evolve"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evolution of defense mechanisms in some bacteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading to drug resistance that makes future infections extremely difficult to treat. In a 28-day experiment, &lt;em&gt;E. faecium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria were exposed to increasing concentrations of pre-methylenomycin C lactone, providing the perfect opportunity for resistance to develop. But over that period, the team did not observe any change in the minimum inhibitory concentration — the amount of drug needed to produce a visible effect. In short, the antibiotic retained its infection-killing activity, and the bacteria did not evolve any problematic resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding this line of research — both to include more bacterial strains and to study the drugs' effects over a longer time frame — will be two important next steps for the team to demonstrate the full potential of the new molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really nice study and I think this is a lesson: if you isolate novel molecules then look for novel activities with those molecules," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofChemistryandChemicalEngineering/Study/PostgraduateResearch/find-a-phd-supervisor/dr-stephen-cochrane.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofChemistryandChemicalEngineering/Study/PostgraduateResearch/find-a-phd-supervisor/dr-stephen-cochrane.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stephen Cochrane&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medicinal chemist at Queen's University Belfast in Ireland who was not involved with the work. However, he cautioned that there is a significant difference between a compound with antibacterial activity and an antibiotic used to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big challenge is translating this into a viable drug — something that persists long enough in the body, isn't toxic to humans, and is not prone to resistance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d93c16b5-69fd-412f-b24a-8f31c21516d6"&gt;For Alkhalaf and Challis, this is exactly the direction they hope to pursue next. They are now collaborating with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/david-lupton/" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/david-lupton/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Lupton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at Monash University in Australia, to develop a chemical route to pre-methylenomycin C lactone. This would enable them to produce the molecule from scratch via chemical synthesis, rather than relying on microbes to make it. In turn, this would provide larger volumes of the compound for studies aimed at understanding how the molecule works and how it might affect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be useful to identify the biological target(s) of the compound in susceptible bacteria and develop a better understanding of how changes to the compound's structure affect target binding and biological activity," Alkhalaf and Challis said. Such insight might inform the design of related compounds with even more potent antibiotic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD — This fall saw Pakistan's first-ever campaign to administer the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8225515/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which protects girls from cervical cancer. The vaccine is highly effective, according to global health groups, and is routinely administered in some 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was not a rousing success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As vaccinators fanned out to schools and other sites in mid-September, they explained that the vaccine would be offered for free to girls ages 9 through 14 and could save their lives if they later contracted HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection that is a major cause of cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, HPV is the third most common cancer, with some 5,000 cases reported annually. The yearly global death toll from the disease is approximately 300,000, with most fatalities in places where screenings and treatment are not easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The teams, operating in parts of Pakistan as well as Pakistan-administered Kashmir, met fierce resistance from some parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They asked: Why is the vaccine being given only to young girls and not boys? (That's a complicated question – boys are eligible and being vaccinated could protect their future female sexual partners but because cervical cancer only affects women, the emphasis is on vaccinating girls.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They wanted to know if the vaccine would affect their daughters' ability to have children later on — and why foreign organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the World Health Organization were involved in the campaign. (Health experts say there's &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/human-papillomavirus-vaccines/infertility" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that the vaccine affects fertility. The concern stemmed from videos parents had seen in WhatsApp groups with the longstanding rumor that the vaccine is a population control ploy by Western funders to sterilize Muslims.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-96605" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"We went three to four times to try to convince people," Rehana Khan Abbasi, 48, a vaccinator working in Bhara Kahu, a town on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city, told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the last official day of the two-week&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;campaign, Abbasi sat in the office of a school trying to get more parents on board. One mother, Zuleikha Bibi, remained hesitant; she'd read the fertility rumors about the HPV vaccine online. And her husband had made it clear that he would not allow their daughter to be vaccinated. "Maybe what people are saying is true, maybe not. Only God knows the truth — we do not know," Bibi said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The goal had been to vaccinate about 90% of around 13 million eligible girls. Khurram Akram, technical director at Pakistan Federal Directorate of Immunization's, estimates that the actual percentage of girls vaccinated was around 70%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our biggest challenge was to counter misinformation," says Akram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This community response underscores the challenge of public vaccination efforts in Pakistan, where skepticism is often fueled by social media hearsay and &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.78JV7NR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;conspiracies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In Bhara Kahu,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;schools sent&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;permission forms back marked "no" before families got a chance to see them, and vaccinators were barred by school administrators from entry, said Syed Ehsan Hussain, a supervisor for the area's rural health center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reaction to the HPV campaign mirrors longstanding vaccine skepticism in Pakistan, which, along with neighboring Afghanistan, is one of only two countries in the world where wild polio circulates. Vaccine hesitancy has been stoked by the revelation that the CIA sponsored a vaccination drive in 2011 in its effort to uncover Osama Bin Laden as well as by misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Messaging around the HPV vaccination has been especially tricky, Hussain said, because HPV is often, though not always, spread through sex. "Whenever we bring up sexual contact again and again, it becomes sensitive due to our religious values and our society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials involved in the campaign say some parents were offended by the introduction of the vaccine as they thought it suggested that their teenage girls were having sex.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials — including the country's federal health minister, Mustafa Kamal — tried to reassure the public by arranging for public vaccination of their own daughters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-96606" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                HPV campaign workers go door-to-door to speak to parents about the HPV vaccine in Bhara Kahu in Islamabad, Pakistan. They met a lot of resistance.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccinators also went door-to-door to address parental fears. They downplayed the sexual transmission of the virus in favor of a broader message warning women about other methods of transmission — during childbirth and through contact with contaminated objects, including in hospital delivery rooms if instruments aren't sterilized properly. This type of transmission, although possible according to some research, is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fatima Khan, 13, was vaccinated during the campaign at her private school in Islamabad after explaining to her mother why she thought it was a good idea. "I was raised on the internet," she told NPR. "I did my own research and explained to her why I thought it was important."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-96604" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Adil Hussain, 36, brought his daughter Ayesha, who's 10, to an HPV vaccination site in Bhara Kahu in Islamabad, Pakistan. Unlike some parents, he responded positively to the vaccine campaign.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Adil Hussain, a 36-year-old hotel security guard in Islamabad, also made up his mind about the vaccine after doing some research. He says when vaccinators didn't show up at his 10-year-old daughter Ayesha's school, he brought her on a Saturday to the local clinic for the shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He doesn't use social media, so online rumors didn't dissuade him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said he and his family members received other routine vaccines in the past, "and now the same is being done for our children." That's an attitude Pakistani officials hope will gain momentum in future campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betsy Joles is a journalist based in Pakistan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s true that these are certainly symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s (the most common form of dementia), missing some of the more subtle signs that aren’t as well-known can lead to a later diagnosis and delay in care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="an estimated 6.7 million Americans over the age of 65" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;an estimated 6.7 million Americans over the age of 65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the U.S. living with Alzheimer’s, dementia is far from rare. So, what dementia-related signs should someone look out for in themselves and others? And when should they see their doctor for a dementia screening? Here’s everything you need to know: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest early sign is spatial issues along with trouble with speech and directions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we all forget a word now and then, if this becomes a pattern, it could signal a problem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficulty with language including word-finding difficulty, incorrect sentence construction or difficulty with self-expression can present well before the loss of memory,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.delraymedicalctr.com/find-a-doctor/detail/arif-dalvi-1659422632" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Arif Dalvi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.delraymedicalctr.com/find-a-doctor/detail/arif-dalvi-1659422632" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Arif Dalvi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a&lt;span&gt; neurologist and physician chief of the Movement Disorders Program at Delray Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to brush this off, but it’s important to monitor if there’s any frequency with this behavior. Additionally, you may notice a change in your sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Visual or spatial skills can also be affected early,” Dalvi continued. “A common way this presents is difficulty navigating a previously familiar route or needing GPS directions to a route that was previously known.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to other red flags as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other less commonly recognized symptoms include difficulty completing familiar tasks, noise sensitivity and a change in taste and smell, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/stanley-appel/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stanley Appel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="690cc915e4b027afb3225b8c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/stanley-appel/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Stanley Appel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, neurologist and d&lt;span&gt;irector of the Ann Kimball &amp;amp; John W.

But both experts emphasized that an early diagnosis can improve quality of life and stop the disease from progressing as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Traditional treatment options, such as medication to manage symptoms, recommendations for lifestyle changes and referrals to support services like occupational and speech therapy are vital in maintaining cognitive function and overall well-being,” Appel said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, in recent years, there has been a significant breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The FDA has approved two new drugs, Aduhelm (aducanumab) and Leqembi (lecanemab), that target the buildup of amyloid beta plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” Appel said. “Although the approval of Aduhelm has been controversial, some studies have shown that it can slow cognitive decline in certain patients. On the other hand, clinical trials have shown that Leqembi can slow cognitive decline in certain patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to lessening the build-up of amyloid plaques, Appel added that some doctors are working on other innovative approaches to treatment. One is to suppress neuroinflammation with regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and other investigations are using advances in gene therapy to develop novel approaches for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These breakthroughs in medical science offer hope for individuals with dementia and their families,” he said. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no “official” age to get a dementia screening, but it’s always a good idea to reach out to your doctor if you’re experiencing any symptoms. Dalvi emphasized that since the incidence of dementia rises with age, particularly after 65, that’s a good time to have a simple dementia screening such as a mini cognitive assessment. Physicians can look for reversible causes of memory loss, like a vitamin B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Screening for hearing loss at this age is also important as it is estimated that 1 out of 9 dementias can be explained on the basis of age-related hearing loss,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there may not be a complete cure for dementia and Alzheimer’s, there is a lot doctors can do once they reach a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There should be no stigma associated with screening for dementia,” Appel said. “An early and accurate diagnosis allows a plan to be put in place for either treating or slowing the cause of dementia.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUnJYcmhuQjNBU1liaGxMam9iZC1NSXJPQzZGQjctZXRVUzVTaXB6TW1IQmdZWlpUcVc1QWhkbHdwNEFER1d1NTMzaHNxRUJ3dTJicTZKZ0NyaExNS1VBZWJDXzVDSk41V1BTUklTS0V0bWloV0dQX3dPRzRDYUtSbC1Ta2hPbWVHNkMtZ0JSb9IBlAFBVV95cUxPX2xocUVydE5kTGQxaWNGWk1MLU92SUNWZWpUSXpQdE5rS21CcFRKek1qQlQxNWhLZDI4Zk5UTmVmOWtJamxNd2p6SHRYQmNsUjVzbnlzZ1RVbEtnMGZBME1FM1FzSHp2aUpJcHcydGVDZW11X3kwbnBwYWg1ZzkxSzBhckRIX05senZfR0QxczhJZnB6</guid></item><item><title>当你吃红薯时，你的血糖会发生什么- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-sweet-potatoes-for-blood-sugar-11845616</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

Leave the skin on, serve with protein and nonstarchy vegetables, and cool them after cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no avoiding the fact that sweet potatoes will raise your blood sugar. “Sweet potatoes are a starchy vegetable, so physiologically their carbohydrates naturally raise post-meal glucose,” says &lt;a href="https://dupagedietitians.com/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Deepa Deshmukh, M.P.H., RDN, CDCES, BC-ADM&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t let that scare you away, though. Even if you have prediabetes or diabetes, you still need carbs for energy, and experiencing a rise in blood sugars is natural after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You just want to avoid a large, rapid spike in blood sugars. A big spike is more likely to happen if you top your sweet potatoes with sweets like sugar or marshmallows. Instead, add toppings rich in protein and fiber like beans, ground meat and nonstarchy veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sweet potatoes contain dietary fiber, which has great benefits for your gastrointestinal system and can help with absorbing glucose, slowing digestion and reducing blood sugar level elevations after eating,” says Pessah-Pollack. A medium sweet potato has about 4 grams of fiber—14% of the Daily Value—and 24 grams of total carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Their fiber, including pectin and resistant starch, slows gastric emptying and carbohydrate absorption, helping blunt the spike compared with lower-fiber starches,” adds Deshmukh. This rich fiber content makes sweet potatoes an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-to-eat-every-week-11787950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent carb choice&lt;/a&gt; for better blood sugars.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as starchy veggies go, sweet potatoes are especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;—a fiber that resists digestion in the small intestine and makes it to your colon intact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There, it gets fermented by microorganisms, which produces short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help reduce inflammation and support glucose metabolism.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have found that including resistant starch in meals leads to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-daily-habits-diabetes-management-11792897" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower post-meal blood sugars&lt;/a&gt; in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is the most important component of sweet potatoes for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the fiber comes from the skin. “Leave the skin on for extra fiber (and potentially less of an increase in blood sugar),” says Pessah-Pollack. By eating the skin, you’ll reap more of the blood sugar–stabilizing benefits of sweet potatoes’ fiber and resistant starch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To manage diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends filling half your plate with nonstarchy veggies, one-quarter with protein, and one-quarter with carbs or starches like sweet potatoes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  This is also a balanced plate for people without diabetes. When assembling a meal with sweet potatoes, add a source of protein and plenty of nonstarchy veggies. This ensures you have a balance of carbs, protein and fiber for optimal blood sugar regulation. Lean proteins like chicken and salmon can be great choices for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939797/the-top-mediterranean-foods-for-better-blood-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health and balancing blood sugars&lt;/a&gt;. Beans and lentils provide both fiber and protein, while nonstarchy veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, greens and mushrooms add fiber and nutrients without a bunch of carbs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although sweet potatoes are undeniably delicious topped with marshmallows and brown sugar, these toppings are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sources of added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. “Skip the sugar and marshmallows if you have diabetes or issues with sugar levels to prevent glucose spikes from these toppings,” recommends Pessah-Pollack. These toppings have a higher glycemic index, so they’re more likely to spike your blood sugars. If you do use sweet toppings, try reducing the amount you use, and pair it with sources of protein and fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Letting your sweet potatoes cool before eating them is a simple way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290850/diabetes-myths-that-dont-lower-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mitigate blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;. “Cook–cool–reheat is believed to increase resistant starch, further moderating glucose rise,” says Deshmukh.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can enjoy them cold in salads or reheat them after you’ve let them cool.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add them to salads. &lt;/strong&gt;Toss cooled, cubed sweet potatoes in your salads—like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277650/sweet-potato-kale-chicken-salad-with-peanut-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Kale &amp;amp; Chicken Salad with Peanut Dressing&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an easy way to add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and resistant starch, plus plenty of flavor to your salad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make loaded sweet potatoes. &lt;/strong&gt;There’s something comforting about a loaded potato. Not just that, but loading up your sweet potato provides an opportunity to add protein and nonstarchy veggies for better blood sugar regulation. For inspiration, check out this diabetes-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275785/chicken-curry-stuffed-sweet-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chicken Curry Stuffed Sweet Potatoes&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use them in grain bowls. &lt;/strong&gt;Toss cubed sweet potatoes in your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-sweet-potato-grain-bowls-8703855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;grain bowl&lt;/a&gt; for a source of carbohydrates and fiber. Bonus for blood sugars if you let them cool first! Split the carbs between sweet potatoes and a whole grain like quinoa. Then top the grains with proteins like chicken, salmon or tofu, and nonstarchy veggies like avocado, broccoli and kale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with different varieties.&lt;/strong&gt; While you may be most familiar with orange sweet potatoes, there are lots of varieties to enjoy. “Explore purple, orange and Japanese white varieties for different textures, polyphenols, vitamins and antioxidants,” says Deshmukh.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree—sweet potatoes are an excellent carb choice when it comes to balancing blood sugars. “While we know that sweet potatoes can raise sugar levels as they are carbohydrates, the overall beneficial effect of the dietary fiber in sweet potatoes can help with glucose levels and improve blood sugar control,” says Pessah-Pollack. To prevent blood sugar spikes, be sure to leave the skin on and pair sweet potatoes with lean protein and nonstarchy veggies. This ensures you’ll get plenty of protein and fiber to slow carbohydrate absorption.

			&lt;p&gt;Listening to music into old age could reduce the risk of dementia by almost 40 percent, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's based on data from 10,893 Australians aged 70 or older, who, at the time of recruitment, were living in retirement communities and had no diagnosis of dementia. They were asked about their music listening habits and whether they played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-surprising-link-between-music-and-brain-health"&gt;There's a Surprising Link Between Music And Brain Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks who "always" listened to music (as opposed to never, rarely, or sometimes listeners) were 39 percent less likely to develop dementia after at least three years of follow-up, and were 17 percent less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment"&gt;milder forms&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive impairments. They also performed better on tests of general cognition and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neuroscientists-find-two-types-of-brain-cells-that-help-us-make-memories"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt;, which is important for recalling everyday events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were regularly picking up an instrument to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; music were 35 percent less likely to develop dementia, but, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2019.1699019"&gt;unlike in other studies&lt;/a&gt;, there was no significant improvement for other kinds of cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who both listened to and played music had a 33 percent reduced dementia risk, and a 22 percent reduced risk for unrelated cognitive impairments. Education level seemed to play a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Music engagement benefits were strongest in those with higher education (16+ years) but showed inconsistent results in the middle education group (12–15 years)," the study's authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.70163"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper's lead author, public health researcher Emma Jaffa from Monash University in Australia, &lt;a href="https://newshub.medianet.com.au/2025/10/music-can-stave-off-dementia-by-up-to-40-per-cent-monash-study-finds/126069/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; these results suggest&lt;span&gt; "music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we don't know for sure if listening to music can really stave off dementia, hearing loss is a known risk factor for dementia, and research shows hearing aids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-trial-suggests-hearing-aids-help-reduce-cognitive-decline"&gt;can reduce cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So it can't hurt to keep your favorite tunes on rotation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Listening to music activates a whole range of regions across your brain," Monash University neuropsychiatric epidemiologist and senior author Joanne Ryan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-30/listening-to-music-can-delay-onset-of-dementia/105950280"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a radio interview, "and so that's really giving you that cognitive stimulation, which is beneficial to help reduce your risk of dementia." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.70163"&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That possibility is now closer than ever. According to a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54785-y" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; 2024 study published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, scientists have developed a glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate gel capable of repairing early enamel damage by mimicking the tooth’s natural mineralisation process. This discovery represents a breakthrough in preventive dentistry. Though still in development, experts believe it could mark a shift from repairing cavities to regenerating enamel naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="30428490" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="regrowing-tooth-enamel" source="keywords"&gt;regrowing tooth enamel&lt;/keyword&gt; matters for &lt;keyword id="20101956" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oral-health" source="keywords"&gt;oral health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth enamel is the strongest material in the human body, yet it cannot regrow once lost. This thin, protective outer layer shields the teeth from acids, bacteria, and wear. When enamel erodes, the inner dentine becomes exposed, causing sensitivity and increasing the risk of decay. Current dental care focuses on patching damaged areas with fillings or crowns, but these are artificial replacements, not true restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nature Communications study explains how scientists aimed to replicate enamel’s natural growth process. Their glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate (CaP) clusters form a nanoscale coating that can merge seamlessly with existing enamel. This new layer mimics the hardness and composition of natural tooth enamel, effectively rebuilding lost mineral density. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research could fundamentally change the approach to oral health by treating early-stage decay before it requires invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How the new enamel-regrowing gel works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology is based on biomimicry, meaning it imitates the natural biological process of enamel formation. During tooth development, cells called ameloblasts secrete proteins that guide calcium and phosphate ions to crystallise into enamel. Once teeth erupt, ameloblasts are lost, making regeneration impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers overcame this by developing a glycerol-stabilised calcium phosphate cluster, a material that mimics enamel’s crystalline structure. When applied to a demineralised tooth surface, these clusters bind tightly and rapidly form a protective coating. In controlled lab tests, the gel successfully repaired early-stage enamel erosion within hours, demonstrating mechanical strength and acid resistance comparable to healthy enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly impressive is that the gel integrates with the tooth surface rather than sitting on top of it. This could make it a non-invasive, self-healing treatment for minor cavities and erosion, something no toothpaste or mouthwash can achieve alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key benefits of regrowing tooth enamel with calcium phosphate gel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If clinical trials confirm its safety and effectiveness, this new gel could transform how dentists manage oral health. The potential benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early &lt;keyword id="26143070" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cavity-prevention" source="keywords"&gt;cavity prevention&lt;/keyword&gt;: The gel could halt tooth decay before it progresses, reducing the need for drilling and fillings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced tooth sensitivity: By sealing exposed dentine, enamel regrowth may naturally relieve discomfort caused by temperature or acids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-lasting protection: The new enamel layer closely matches the hardness and resilience of the natural one, improving durability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accessible preventive care: Applied by dentists or potentially in at-home treatments, it could make enamel protection easier for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these outcomes suggest a future where dental damage can be repaired before it becomes irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What limitations remain before enamel regrowth becomes available&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, the Nature Communications research is still in its experimental phase. The gel has shown success in laboratory and simulated oral environments, but human clinical trials are still needed. Scientists must confirm how well it performs under real-life conditions like chewing, saliva exposure, and bacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is scalability. Producing stable, medical-grade calcium phosphate clusters that retain effectiveness over time is complex and costly. It may take several years before the product reaches dental clinics. Researchers are now exploring ways to optimise its composition and shelf life to ensure consistent results in everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of dentistry with enamel regrowth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successfully commercialised, tooth enamel regrowth technology could mark a major turning point in dental care. Instead of filling cavities, dentists could focus on biological repair and regeneration, preserving the tooth’s natural structure. Preventive treatments might become as simple as a topical application during a check-up, making oral care less invasive and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, maintaining enamel health remains essential. Brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, avoiding acidic foods, and scheduling routine dental visits are still the best defences against enamel erosion. This new discovery adds hope, not replacement, to those habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of regrowing tooth enamel was once science fiction, but it is now on the verge of becoming science fact.

But recent research suggests that it may also serve an unexpected purpose, relieving constipation. Constipation, a common digestive issue affecting millions worldwide, has long been linked to factors such as poor hydration, low fibre intake, and sedentary behaviour. Yet scientists are now exploring how coffee and its caffeine content may help stimulate bowel movements naturally. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38167025/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed a significant association between higher caffeine intake and lower odds of constipation, shedding light on coffee’s lesser-known impact on gut motility and microbiota balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why caffeine makes you poop: How your morning coffee keeps digestion moving&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine acts as a natural stimulant, not just for the brain but also for the digestive system. Once ingested, it triggers contractions in the colon, known as peristalsis, which help move stool through the intestines. Researchers have found that caffeinated coffee produces a stronger colonic response than water or decaffeinated coffee, supporting its role in promoting bowel activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the BMC Public Health study, adults with higher caffeine intake showed 20–40 per cent lower odds of constipation than those consuming minimal amounts. The researchers analysed over 13,000 participants and found that moderate to high caffeine intake (roughly the equivalent of one to three cups of coffee a day) was associated with more regular bowel movements, particularly among young and middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying mechanism appears to go beyond caffeine’s stimulating effect. Some studies indicate that compounds in coffee, including chlorogenic acids, may influence the gut microbiota, the community of bacteria crucial for digestion and nutrient absorption. By promoting microbial diversity and supporting beneficial bacteria, coffee could indirectly aid in maintaining healthy intestinal movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why only caffeinated coffee makes you poop, not decaf&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking finding from the BMC Public Health analysis was that caffeinated coffee had a measurable effect on constipation relief, while decaffeinated coffee did not. This suggests that caffeine itself, rather than other coffee compounds, is the primary driver of the digestive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments measuring colon contractions, participants who consumed caffeinated coffee showed increased motor activity within minutes, similar to the effect of a meal. This rapid stimulation of the colon helps trigger the gastrocolic reflex, the natural wave of muscular contractions that encourages bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decaffeinated coffee, although rich in antioxidants, lacks this stimulant effect. However, both caffeinated and decaffeinated varieties can still support digestive health when consumed as part of a balanced diet, especially when paired with adequate hydration and fibre intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why coffee’s poop-boosting power fades with age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that coffee’s constipation-relieving effect was strongest in younger and middle-aged adults but less pronounced among older adults. Age-related changes in gut motility, medication use, and lower caffeine metabolism may explain these differences. Older adults often experience slower digestive movement and may require a combination of dietary adjustments, hydration, and light physical activity alongside coffee to experience similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While caffeine consumption can enhance colonic motility, excessive intake can cause discomfort, jitters, or dehydration, factors that might worsen constipation in sensitive individuals. Therefore, balance and moderation remain key, particularly for older populations or those with underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The right way to drink coffee for better digestion&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee’s gut-stimulating effect is real, but it depends on how and when you consume it. Health experts emphasise that timing, preparation, and moderation can influence whether coffee supports or disrupts digestive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to make the most of coffee’s natural laxative effect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep consumption moderate. One to two cups of coffee a day, providing around 100–200 milligrams of caffeine, are usually sufficient to stimulate healthy bowel movement without side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time it right. Drinking coffee in the morning or soon after meals helps activate the gastrocolic reflex, promoting natural bowel contractions. Avoid coffee on an empty stomach to reduce the risk of acidity or discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrate well. Caffeine has mild diuretic properties, so pair every cup with water to prevent dehydration and maintain stool softness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid heavy add-ins. Cream, sugar, or high-fat milk can slow digestion. Opt for black coffee or a small amount of low-fat milk for the best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose wisely. Filtered or cold-brew coffee is gentler on the stomach. Strong espresso or unfiltered brews can be harsher and should be consumed in smaller amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know your limits. Those sensitive to caffeine or on medication that affects gut motility should consult a healthcare professional before increasing intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternate caffeine days. Skipping coffee occasionally can prevent tolerance and sustain its gut-stimulating effect over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond caffeine: What else could be helping&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between coffee and digestive health might extend beyond caffeine alone. Polyphenols and other plant compounds in coffee act as prebiotics, subtly reshaping the gut microbiome in favour of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. These microbes play a crucial role in producing short-chain fatty acids, which enhance intestinal movement and help maintain softer stool consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have also shown that caffeine can restore disrupted gut microbial balance and improve levels of butyrate, a compound essential for colon health. Together, these findings suggest that coffee’s effect on constipation is multifaceted, involving both muscle stimulation and microbiome modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A natural, science-backed way to stay regular&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coffee is no substitute for a fibre-rich diet, hydration, and physical activity, emerging research supports its role as a mild, natural aid for constipation. By enhancing colonic motility and supporting microbial diversity, caffeinated coffee offers a surprisingly simple addition to digestive wellness. As scientists continue to explore the gut–brain connection, your morning brew might just be doing more than waking you up; it could be keeping your digestive system in motion, one cup at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

He stressed, “All these screenings that I am telling you about are to detect it at stage zero, meaning cancer cells have formed, but they have not started spreading. If only those cells are removed at that time, the disease gets eradicated from its roots with almost 100% success.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the 4 cancer screenings he suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Mammography&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammography for breast cancer should be done once by the age of 40, advised the oncologist. He stressed, “Annual mammograms are often recommended every year, but most people don't need them every year. Even once every two years is enough.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Cervical cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sharma, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer. “The Pap smear is a very effective test for this. A Pap smear can detect cancer at stage zero,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/original/cancer_tests_1762663283392.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="4 necessary tests to detect cancer early.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Stool test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the oncologist recommended doing a stool test for stomach cancer. He explained, “The first sign of cancer inside the stomach is bleeding from somewhere. A stool test can detect blood.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Chest CT scan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, according to the oncologist Dr Sharma, those who smoke a lot and have been smoking for a long time should get a chest CT done because they have a chance of getting lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stay informed.

What if managing cholesterol did not always mean daily pills, relentless diet tracking or stressing about missed doses? According to a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2511778" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, gene-editing technology known as CRISPR has been used in humans to sharply lower levels of “bad” cholesterol and triglycerides in a single treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means for you is that the path to a healthier heart is not only new drugs or stricter diets, it might also be about smarter treatments combined with everyday habits. The results of the study were presented Saturday, November 08, 2025, at the American Heart Association's annual meeting. Here is what the science says and how you can stay in control of your cardiovascular wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science snapshot: One-and-done vs life-long routine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial in question involved a small group of adults whose cholesterol remained high despite existing therapies. Researchers targeted a gene in the liver called ANGPTL3 using CRISPR, turning it off in order to mimic rare protective mutations found in some people. In this study, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides dropped by about 50% within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

However, the caution remains that it is early days hence, safety must be monitored long-term and the technology is not yet available to most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters for everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, “Great but what about me?” Even if you are not a candidate for gene editing, this breakthrough highlights three big messages for your lifestyle -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention continues to matter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Technology is advancing but healthy habits still form the foundation. Daily nutrition, movement and stress management remain essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your cholesterol story is longer than stat numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Most people view cholesterol as “numbers on a lab result.” This trial reminds us that there is a genetic and biological upstream, meaning that what you do over the years still counts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope meets realism: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Seeing a future where a one-time intervention exists does not excuse today’s choices. It reinforces how powerful prevention really is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Everyday moves that amplify your heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you ride the wave of optimism around gene-editing, here are daily practices to stay proactive. These are not replacements but just solid support for your heart:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise sunlight and movement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Outdoor walks support circulation and enhance mood and both are beneficial for heart health. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/national-walking-day-nih-researcher-available-discuss-heart-healthy-benefits-walking" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Studies show that a daily walk can boost &lt;keyword id="20068019" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cardiovascular-health" source="keywords"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/keyword&gt; by lowering the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, obesity and Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on gut-heart connection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Emerging science recognises that gut health impacts lipid metabolism. Fibre-rich whole foods, legumes, vegetables and fermented foods support that axis. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5390330/" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 review in Physiology &amp;amp; Heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that “the gut microbiota can mechanistically impact host lipid levels … independent of body mass index and other metabolic disturbances.” The gut is not just digestion. It is linked to how lipids are handled in your body, which affects heart health. Eating fibre-rich, whole foods and fermented options supports that axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor stress and sleep:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Chronic stress and poor sleep raise inflammation, which worsens heart risk. Simple mindfulness, screen-free time before bed and regular sleep cycles help. A &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11883-024-01207-5" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 review in Emerging Topics in Life Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that sleep disturbances raise inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6, which are linked to higher cardiovascular risk. Poor sleep and high stress both trigger inflammation, higher blood pressure and worse lipid profiles, which are all harmful for your heart. Managing them matters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your numbers and your story: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Regular cholesterol, triglyceride, blood pressure and BMI check-ups keep you aligned. If you have family history or stubborn cholesterol despite good habits, ask about genetic testing or specialised lipid clinics. The practice of regularly checking cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, BMI etc is supported widely in cardiovascular prevention literature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat it as a long game:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The gene-editing news is promising but not immediate for most. In the meantime, adopting heart-smart habits now buys you healthier futures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture: Medicine, lifestyle and you&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cardiologist experts noted, gene editing for common diseases is a “revolution in progress” but revolutions don’t happen overnight. This means that your best move is not waiting, it is living. Your habits today shape how you age tomorrow. While future treatments may simplify the fight against heart disease, your daily choices remain the most powerful levers you hold. Every vegetable, every walk, every hour of quality sleep builds resilience. In the end, whether you benefit from the gene-editing wave or not, think of your heart health as both legacy and lifestyle. A one-time treatment may be around the corner but until then, every day is your chance to invest in the life you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

In a November 8 Instagram post, Dr Joseph Salhab, a board-certified gastroenterologist and popular health influencer known as @thestomachdoc on social media, listed 6 snacks you can include in your daily diet to protect yourself from colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6 snacks to fight colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the list of 6 snack combinations to fight colon cancer, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/does-coffee-make-you-rush-to-the-loo-florida-gastroenterologist-explains-why-drinking-coffee-stimulates-bowel-movements-101762614578668.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Dr Salhab"&gt;Dr Salhab&lt;/a&gt; noted, “These foods had some of the strongest effects in lowering colon cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Additionally, he pointed out that these recommendations are science-backed, as some are included in a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10198059/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="May 2023 meta-analysis"&gt;May 2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;: “Different types of fruit intake and colorectal cancer risk,” published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the 6 snacks Dr Salhab recommended:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Watermelon with lime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first snack the gastroenterologist suggested in the video is eating watermelon with lime. According to him, the combination contains lycopene and vitamin C, which helps reduce the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Walnuts with yoghurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he suggested having a handful of walnuts with some yoghurt. It contains omega-3 and probiotics, which can be beneficial for your colon health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Avocado with salsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist recommended having avocado with salsa. In the video, he can be seen enjoying this combination on a toasted slice of bread. According to him, avocados and salsa are rich in fibre and prebiotics, which help boost immune cells in the colon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Blueberry and chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Salhab suggested making a blueberry chia pudding with blueberries and chia seeds. They have anthocyanins and soluble fibre, which nourish protective bacteria present in the colon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Apples and cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a few slices of apple and sprinkle them with cinnamon. This snack contains pectin fibre and polyphenols, which produce more butyrate for anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Kiwi with honey yoghurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr Salhab recommended having kiwi with some yoghurt drizzled with honey, as the fibre present in kiwi can repair DNA damage in the colon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

However, in many situations, particularly during critical illness or acute medical events, hypotension can be dangerous. When blood pressure drops too low, oxygen-rich blood struggles to reach vital organs, which can lead to cellular damage, organ dysfunction, and even organ failure if not addressed promptly. Understanding hypotension involves exploring why adequate blood pressure is essential for organ perfusion, how the body compensates to maintain blood flow, which organs are most vulnerable, and what happens when these compensatory mechanisms fail. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications from low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blood pressure and how low levels affect your organs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is the force blood exerts against the walls of blood vessels. It is measured as systolic/diastolic pressure (e.g., 120/80 mmHg). However, for organ perfusion, mean arterial pressure or MAP, the average pressure in the arteries, is more relevant. Organs rely on adequate pressure to ensure continuous blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When MAP drops below 60 to 65 mmHg, perfusion becomes inadequate, meaning organs no longer receive enough oxygen and nutrients. Without sufficient perfusion, cellular metabolism is impaired, leading to cell injury or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Improve Low Blood Pressure Naturally: Here Are 4 DIY Home Hacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the systolic or diastolic pressures seem mildly low, prolonged hypotension can cause cumulative organ damage because organs are highly sensitive to oxygen delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How low blood pressure leads to organ failure&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://janesthanalgcritcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44158-022-00045-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (2022), arterial hypotension during surgery and in the intensive care unit can significantly impact patient outcomes. The authors highlight that maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial for organ perfusion, as drops in pressure can lead to hypoperfusion and subsequent organ dysfunction or failure. The study outlines common causes of perioperative hypotension, explains its effects on vital organs, and discusses prevention strategies and remedies that clinicians can use to minimise complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At normal blood pressure, blood flow delivers oxygen and nutrients to tissues. Hypotension reduces this flow. The body attempts to compensate through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased heart rate to maintain cardiac output.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peripheral vasoconstriction redirects blood to essential organs like the brain and heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hypotension is severe or prolonged, these compensatory mechanisms cannot keep up. Organs experience hypoperfusion, leading to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). Hypoxia impairs cellular energy production, leading to cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, and necrosis, which can accumulate into organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organ-specific vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all organs respond to hypotension the same way. Some are more susceptible due to high metabolic demands or limited autoregulatory capacity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidneys: The kidneys filter blood and require a constant supply of oxygen. Low blood pressure reduces renal perfusion, impairing filtration and potentially causing acute kidney injury (AKI).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver: Reduced hepatic artery and portal vein flow can cause ischemic hepatitis, sometimes called “shock liver.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain: Cerebral perfusion drops in hypotension, potentially causing confusion, syncope, or even coma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart: Low coronary perfusion reduces oxygen delivery to cardiac muscle, increasing the risk of ischemia and arrhythmias.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of organ damage depends on how low the pressure drops and how long it persists. Even short periods of severe hypotension can trigger irreversible cellular injury, particularly in sensitive organs like the kidneys and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Role of duration and severity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnitude: The lower the blood pressure, the greater the risk of organ hypoperfusion. MAP below 60 mmHg or systolic BP below 90 mmHg is considered particularly dangerous in critical care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duration: Even moderate hypotension can cause organ injury if sustained over hours.

"I'm not panicking, but I am worried." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what's going on? And what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists track the evolution of influenza viruses because they mutate constantly and the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This evolution happens in a rhythm known as "shift and drift". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most of the time the virus drifts along making minor changes and then every so often there is a sudden abrupt shift as the virus mutates substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That happened in June this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seven mutations appeared in a strain of H3N2 seasonal flu and led to a "fast increase" in reports of the mutated virus, says Prof Derek Smith, the director of the centre for pathogen evolution at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images 3D illustration showing spherical object representing the virus.

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unusually, this happened outside flu season in the middle of the northern hemisphere's summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It almost certainly will sweep the world, so from that standpoint, it's something that will come up quickly," says Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By September, as children went back to school, the nights drew in and the temperatures started to drop, there was an uptick in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Exactly what the mutations are doing is still being explored, but they are probably helping the virus to evade some of the immunity we have built up over years of flu infections and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The result is the virus is finding it easier to infect people and spread – that is why the flu season is so early in the UK and other countries including Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the virus can spread more easily then it does not have to wait for more favourable wintery conditions – when we spend more time indoors with the heating on and the windows shut – to start the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're miles ahead," says Prof Lewis, "I think it's going to be a strong flu season".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you remember your R numbers from the pandemic (that is the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to), they suggest the new mutant has an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seasonal flu usually has an R number of around 1.2, while the early estimate for this year is 1.4, said Prof Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So very roughly, if 100 people had flu, they would pass it to 120 in a typical year and 140 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Worst flu season for a decade?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's highly likely it's going to be a bad flu season and it's going to happen quite soon, we're already well into it," says Prof Christophe Fraser, from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are indicators that this could be worse than some of the flu seasons we've seen in the last 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In a typical flu season around one-in-five of us get infected, but that could be higher this year, he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But all these predictions are still clouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some look to Australia for clues as it had the worst flu season on record this year, although it did not face the same mutated H3N2 we have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We know the virus is spreading very well in children in the germ-fest that is the school playground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the immunity a 10-year-old has developed will be very different from that of their grandparents whose immune defences may have been shaped by six times as many flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So, experts will be watching closely as the virus starts infecting older age groups in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'It's a nastier virus'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;History suggests that the form of influenza we are facing this year is more severe, particularly for older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are multiple types of flu and you may have heard some of the names like H1N1 swine flu, which caused a pandemic in 2009, or H5N1 which is the current flu killing birds around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The fresh mutations have happened in a group of H3N2 influenzas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"H3 is always a hotter virus, it's a nastier virus, it's more impactful on the population," said Prof Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is worth remembering that some of us will get flu and develop no symptoms at all, while others get a sudden fever, body aches and exhaustion, but the virus can be deadly in older and more vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths. The NHS is already anticipating a tough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The clear advice is to get the seasonal flu vaccine – the NHS in England issued a "flu jab SOS" saying there were 2.4 million vaccine slots available in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two people in a bland, white clinic room.

"I'm not panicking, but I am worried." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what's going on? And what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists track the evolution of influenza viruses because they mutate constantly and the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This evolution happens in a rhythm known as "shift and drift". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most of the time the virus drifts along making minor changes and then every so often there is a sudden abrupt shift as the virus mutates substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That happened in June this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seven mutations appeared in a strain of H3N2 seasonal flu and led to a "fast increase" in reports of the mutated virus, says Prof Derek Smith, the director of the centre for pathogen evolution at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/37d7/live/5d4b63f0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images 3D illustration showing spherical object representing the virus.

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unusually, this happened outside flu season in the middle of the northern hemisphere's summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It almost certainly will sweep the world, so from that standpoint, it's something that will come up quickly," says Prof Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By September, as children went back to school, the nights drew in and the temperatures started to drop, there was an uptick in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Exactly what the mutations are doing is still being explored, but they are probably helping the virus to evade some of the immunity we have built up over years of flu infections and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The result is the virus is finding it easier to infect people and spread – that is why the flu season is so early in the UK and other countries including Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the virus can spread more easily then it does not have to wait for more favourable wintery conditions – when we spend more time indoors with the heating on and the windows shut – to start the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're miles ahead," says Prof Lewis, "I think it's going to be a strong flu season".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you remember your R numbers from the pandemic (that is the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to), they suggest the new mutant has an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seasonal flu usually has an R number of around 1.2, while the early estimate for this year is 1.4, said Prof Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So very roughly, if 100 people had flu, they would pass it to 120 in a typical year and 140 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Worst flu season for a decade?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's highly likely it's going to be a bad flu season and it's going to happen quite soon, we're already well into it," says Prof Christophe Fraser, from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are indicators that this could be worse than some of the flu seasons we've seen in the last 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In a typical flu season around one-in-five of us get infected, but that could be higher this year, he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But all these predictions are still clouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some look to Australia for clues as it had the worst flu season on record this year, although it did not face the same mutated H3N2 we have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We know the virus is spreading very well in children in the germ-fest that is the school playground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the immunity a 10-year-old has developed will be very different from that of their grandparents whose immune defences may have been shaped by six times as many flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So, experts will be watching closely as the virus starts infecting older age groups in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'It's a nastier virus'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;History suggests that the form of influenza we are facing this year is more severe, particularly for older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are multiple types of flu and you may have heard some of the names like H1N1 swine flu, which caused a pandemic in 2009, or H5N1 which is the current flu killing birds around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The fresh mutations have happened in a group of H3N2 influenzas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"H3 is always a hotter virus, it's a nastier virus, it's more impactful on the population," said Prof Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is worth remembering that some of us will get flu and develop no symptoms at all, while others get a sudden fever, body aches and exhaustion, but the virus can be deadly in older and more vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths. The NHS is already anticipating a tough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The clear advice is to get the seasonal flu vaccine – the NHS in England issued a "flu jab SOS" saying there were 2.4 million vaccine slots available in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b14/live/6dc846d0-bbd7-11f0-bd4a-49c00e3ca628.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two people in a bland, white clinic room.

About seven per cent of them reported drinking three or more alcoholic drinks daily. Compared to non-drinkers, heavy drinkers experienced 70 per cent larger bleeds and were, on average, 11 years younger when the event occurred - 64 versus 75.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CT and MRI scans showed that these patients were also more likely to have deep brain bleeds or ones that extended into fluid-filled spaces around the brain. Researchers noted evidence of chronic damage to small blood vessels - the kind of deterioration often seen in dementia, balance issues, and memory decline. Even moderate drinkers, consuming just two drinks a day, showed signs of earlier onset of brain bleeds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Heavy alcohol use appears to raise blood pressure and damage the brain’s small vessels,” Gurol told The Harvard Gazette.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-trailer-released-check-length-release-date-and-other-key-details-101762592274367.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair trailer released; check length, release date and other key details"&gt;Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair trailer released; check length, release date and other key details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The biological toll of alcohol on the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that heavy drinkers arrived at the hospital with lower platelet counts and higher &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-york-cardiologist-with-30-years-of-experience-shares-most-common-high-blood-pressure-symptom-you-should-never-ignore-101762488874679.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a combination that makes the brain especially vulnerable. With platelets reduced, the body struggles to stop bleeding, and high pressure makes vessels more prone to rupture. Together, those factors increase both the likelihood and severity of brain haemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gurol emphasised that even small reductions in alcohol consumption can make a difference. “We now know that heavy drinking leads to larger, earlier brain bleeds,” he said. “Minimising or stopping alcohol use is an important step to lower that risk. Even for people at relatively low risk, limiting alcohol to no more than three drinks per week may help protect brain and cardiovascular health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also acknowledged limitations: self-reported alcohol use, a small number of heavy drinkers, and the fact that the study was based at a single hospital with mostly white participants. Future research, they noted, should involve more diverse populations and track long-term drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The OnlyFans sensation, known for her jaw-dropping content and strong social media presence, gave her 1.8 million followers a glimpse of her sun-soaked lifestyle with a photo that’s turning heads. The Florida-based model and entrepreneur, who’s built a thriving fanbase through her exclusive content and fitness-focused posts, shared the picture on September 27. In the photo, Bryce is seen soaking up the sun poolside, posing confidently in a sleek, long-sleeve royal blue swimsuit that perfectly hugs her toned physique.

On September 13, the OnlyFans star flaunted her famously toned abs while lounging by the pool in a neutral beige two-piece with a unique cutout design. Her caption, “Pools or hot tubs?” teased followers with the ultimate summer dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-iNJlaU bHjuUC sc-gwrIee khdHtu"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-dTXmAU huFsAz"&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-lesvXt fcCFaC lngtd-dynamic-inarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-iHlJgr jqBaUC" data-header="true"&gt;Adams Swings Into Golf Season With A Playful Twist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="sc-iSnsYj BhNvd"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when fans thought Bryce Adams couldn’t surprise them anymore, she teed up a lighthearted look that had everyone talking. On September 9, the OnlyFans star shared a cheeky photo showing off her athletic figure and sense of humor, writing, “Officially ready for golf season!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-iSnsYj BhNvd"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shot, Bryce rocked a white bikini top and bright orange bottoms, accessorized with a golf glove and a golf ball perfectly placed in her top, proving she knows exactly what she's doing.  The comments section quickly lit up with fire and heart emojis.

Cashews, the creamy and nutrient-rich nuts from the cashew tree, are packed with heart-healthy fats, essential minerals like magnesium and potassium, and powerful antioxidants that support cardiovascular function. Studies suggest that regular cashew consumption may help lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol balance, and reduce triglyceride levels, three vital factors for heart health. When consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, cashews can play a simple yet effective role in maintaining a healthy, resilient heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthy fats present in cashews that protect your heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashews are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, the same “good fats” found in olive oil and avocados. These fats help lower harmful LDL cholesterol while maintaining healthy HDL cholesterol levels. Balanced cholesterol reduces the buildup of plaque in arteries, improving blood circulation and lowering the risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Best dry fruits for winter and why you should consume them every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike saturated fats found in processed foods and red meat, the fats in cashews support blood vessel flexibility and reduce inflammation. Regularly eating cashews may also help lower total cholesterol and improve the ratio of good to bad cholesterol, which is an important marker for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benefits of eating cashews for heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6573847/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, regular consumption of cashew nuts was linked to significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as lower triglyceride levels, indicating potential heart-protective benefits. While the study found no major changes in total cholesterol or HDL and LDL levels, researchers suggested that adding cashews to a balanced diet may support overall cardiovascular health and help manage blood pressure naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural blood pressure regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashews are an excellent source of magnesium and potassium, two minerals vital for controlling blood pressure. Magnesium helps relax blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing strain on the heart. Potassium balances sodium levels in the body, which can prevent hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that people who include moderate amounts of cashews and other nuts in their diet tend to have healthier blood pressure levels. These small daily changes can make a measurable difference in long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving blood lipid levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, are a major risk factor for heart disease when levels are too high. Cashews have been shown to help reduce triglyceride levels and improve overall lipid profiles. Their combination of healthy fats, fibre, and plant compounds helps the body process fats more efficiently, preventing their buildup in arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption, even in small amounts, may support healthier cholesterol and triglyceride levels, especially when combined with a diet low in processed foods and rich in fresh produce and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress damage the lining of blood vessels and accelerate heart disease progression. Cashews contain antioxidants such as polyphenols and tocopherols, which neutralise harmful free radicals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These natural compounds protect heart tissue, reduce inflammation, and support the repair of blood vessel walls. The antioxidants in cashews, when paired with other nutrient-dense foods, can enhance cardiovascular protection and slow the effects of ageing on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Supporting a healthy weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy weight is key to reducing the risk of heart disease, and cashews can play a role here as well. Though calorie-dense, they are rich in protein, fibre, and healthy fats that increase satiety and prevent overeating. Eating a small portion of cashews as a snack may help control cravings for less healthy foods and support steady energy levels throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research also suggests that people who regularly eat nuts tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) despite their high calorie content, likely due to their positive effects on metabolism and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to include cashews in a heart-healthy diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat 5-10 unsalted cashews daily as a snack or part of your breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add to salads, smoothies, or stir-fries for extra texture and nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose raw or dry-roasted cashews over salted or oil-fried varieties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair with other heart-healthy foods like berries, leafy greens, whole grains, and oily fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice moderation, one small handful (about 28 g) per day is sufficient for health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Precautions to keep in mind&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cashews are beneficial, overconsumption can add excess calories, potentially leading to weight gain. Always choose unsalted or lightly roasted varieties to avoid too much sodium, which can raise blood pressure. Those with nut allergies should avoid cashews completely. Additionally, while they support cardiovascular health, cashews should complement, not replace, other healthy habits such as regular exercise and medical treatment where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Blood pressure is an important indicator of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-for-metabolic-syndrome-8782901" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; and healthy blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. The top number (systolic) measures pressure when your heart beats, while the bottom (diastolic) measures it between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and medications play the biggest roles in managing it, small daily habits—like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drink-blood-pressure-study-11760522" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sipping green tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;sipping green tea&lt;/a&gt;—may also have an impact. We spoke with nutrition experts to find out how drinking green tea affects your blood pressure and who should avoid it, plus tips to add it to your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Green Tea Affects Blood Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;May Relax Blood Vessels and Improve Circulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of green tea’s heart-healthy blood pressure benefits come from antioxidant compounds called catechins—these polyphenols help blood vessels stay flexible and open. “One compound in particular, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), boosts nitric oxide and promotes vasodilation, helping your blood vessels relax,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bess Berger, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. When your blood vessels relax, or vasodilate, your blood pressure lowers—a short-term effect that supports smoother circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While catechins are one type of tea polyphenol, the blood pressure–lowering effects of green tea are probably attributable to a combination of all of the plant compounds it contains instead of an individual few,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.drnutritionchanger.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Qianzhi Jiang, Ph.D., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Qianzhi Jiang, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some research suggests that green tea may lower blood pressure in both healthy individuals and those with hypertension, the results are inconsistent, and further long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Helps Protect Arteries from Long-Term Damage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While green tea may help blood vessels relax in the moment, its bigger advantage may come from how it protects them over time. The same polyphenols that give green tea its antioxidant strength appear to guard arteries against oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation—two drivers of the slow, silent damage that can increase blood pressure with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Green tea’s catechins support blood vessel health by reducing inflammation and improving how your vessels function,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dieteticseducation.org/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Devon Golem, Ph.D., RD, LDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Devon Golem, Ph.D., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, that can translate to more supple arteries that expand and contract more easily, helping your heart pump blood efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result isn’t an overnight change in blood pressure but a gradual, protective effect that keeps arteries healthy and resilient in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Caffeine Can Temporarily Raise Blood Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although green tea generally has less caffeine than coffee—about 30 milligrams of caffeine in an 8-ounce cup of green tea versus 95 mg in the same serving of coffee—it’s still a stimulant that can cause a short-term increase in blood pressure. “If you’re super-sensitive to caffeine, green tea could cause a temporary bump in blood pressure right after drinking it,” says Berger. This effect typically fades within a few hours as your body metabolizes the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, this short-term spike doesn’t cancel out green tea’s long-term cardiovascular benefits. Research suggests that the long-term benefits of drinking green tea likely outweigh the short-term effect caffeine may have on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re prone to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine jitters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;caffeine jitters&lt;/a&gt;, switching to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030655/does-green-tea-have-caffeine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decaf green tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;decaf green tea&lt;/a&gt; can be a good option. You’ll still get many of the same beneficial antioxidants, as one review compared caffeinated and decaffeinated green tea extract supplements and found no difference in blood pressure effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Much Green Tea Should You Drink Daily?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no official guideline for how much green tea to drink for blood pressure benefits. “The majority of the studies used three to four cups of green tea daily, and greater reductions in blood pressure were observed with longer use—more than three months,” explains Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewing matters, too. Jiang says that most of green tea’s polyphenols are released within the first five minutes of steeping, so letting your tea sit for a few minutes can help you get the most benefit from each cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overconsumption is very rare from green tea beverages,” says Jiang&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; However, green tea extracts may lead to side effects, including nausea, abdominal discomfort and increased blood pressure. Experts agree: It’s better to drink green tea than to take supplements that contain green tea extracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Green Tea Interacts with Blood Pressure Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While brewed tea in moderate amounts is generally safe, concentrated green tea extracts can interfere with how certain drugs are absorbed or metabolized. Studies show that green tea can reduce the effectiveness of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/medications-don-t-mix-with-green-tea-11815448" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain blood pressure medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain blood pressure medications&lt;/a&gt;, including the beta-blocker nadolol. It may also interfere with other heart or cholesterol drugs when taken at the same time. These effects are more likely with high intakes or green tea extracts, but brewed tea can still play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take medication for blood pressure or cholesterol, it’s worth checking with your health care provider to make sure that green tea fits safely into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Green Tea Safe for Everyone?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, a few cups of green tea a day are perfectly safe—and even beneficial—but there are some exceptions. “Caffeine can negatively affect pregnant and breastfeeding women, children and individuals with anxiety, irregular heartbeats, seizures, sleep issues and irritable bowel syndrome,” says Golem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, keep total &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;caffeine intake&lt;/a&gt; under 200 mg per day (about two cups of green tea, depending on strength), or follow your health care provider’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who prefer to limit their caffeine intake can still benefit from drinking decaf green tea, which contains many of the same antioxidants but with less caffeine. While it’s uncommon, concentrated green tea extracts have been linked to liver issues in sensitive individuals, so sticking to brewed tea is the safest way to enjoy its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Enjoy Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try It Iced:&lt;/strong&gt; Brew a few cups ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249466/iced-mint-green-tea/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chill them;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chill them&lt;/a&gt; for a refreshing afternoon drink.

Jiang notes that in Japan, green tea is sometimes poured over rice and topped with salmon and scallions—a simple dish called ochazuke that adds subtle flavor and antioxidants to your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea isn’t a magic fix for high blood pressure, but it can play a small role in supporting heart health—especially when enjoyed regularly as part of a healthy lifestyle. Its polyphenols can help relax blood vessels in the short term and protect them from long-term damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend getting your green tea from the cup, not a capsule. Brewed tea offers the ideal balance of beneficial compounds without the risks associated with concentrated extracts. A few cups a day—paired with other healthy habits like eating a balanced diet, staying active and managing stress—can help keep your blood pressure in a healthy range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/green-tea-and-blood-pressure-11844020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 20:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOdDZabzFBX2E1R0luQ3BaZjlJVnRfT2lsTVFhbmdZWW5URVBjMzlJUUdVS0RVX3F4T2xTWVJ0YUh5NkpLQmJPYm8yTVVtLTJiNWoxb2JyY1pBWUdLRXN6NDZPNnY2b2g3R29OcFYxTkJCQW1abE9PT01hMFBnVUhoZXNnaXA</guid></item><item><title>史坦顿岛家庭在万圣节被诊断出患有白血病后寻求支持- SILive.com</title><link>https://www.silive.com/news/2025/11/staten-island-family-seeks-support-after-toddlers-devastating-leukemia-diagnosis-on-halloween.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WYZOZBXW4FC6JI2Q3V7K3CO2PQ"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — A &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-our-double-rainbow-warrior-fight-leukemia?attribution_id=sl:dd52600c-6490-4d8c-a13d-ac50ab26e5c4&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1762379687&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;amp;utm_content=amp17_tc&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-our-double-rainbow-warrior-fight-leukemia?attribution_id=sl:dd52600c-6490-4d8c-a13d-ac50ab26e5c4&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1762379687&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;amp;utm_content=amp17_tc&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; campaign has been started for Lilith “Lily” Ashby, 2, the brave only child of Loriann and Charlie Ashby who is facing the fight of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SBBBED7FKNAVJE6EKNXLCEPYYE"&gt;On Halloween, while other children were trick-or-treating and enjoying time with their family, little Lily, who lives in Great Kills with her parents, received a devastating diagnosis — leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNDA6IONANHODAVDOKNV3HDR64"&gt;“This all started in early October,” Charlie said. “We were trying to figure out a cough Lily had for about a month.

&lt;p&gt;If a healthy slurp is your aim, skip the banana when you whip up a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California-Davis found that adding banana may interfere with absorption of powerful compounds called flavanols, which are linked to brain and heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were really surprised to see how quickly adding a single banana decreased the level of flavanols in the smoothie and the levels of flavanol absorbed in the body," lead author Javier Ottaviani said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ottaviani is an adjunct researcher at UC-Davis and director of the Core Laboratory at Mars Edge, part of Mars Inc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavanols -- which are found in such foods as apples, berries, cocoa and grapes -- are natural compounds that help support memory, reduce inflammation and improve blood flow when consumed regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, unless banana or another ingredient get in the way, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is an enzyme abundant in bananas called polyphenol oxidase (PPO). In experiments, banana-based smoothies dramatically cut flavanol absorption compared to berry-based ones, researchers reported recently in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/fo/d3fo01599h" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted to learn whether the same enzyme activity that quickly causes a banana or apple to turn brown when peeled affected how much of these beneficial flavanols the body absorbs when the fruits are combined in a smoothie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We sought to understand, on a very practical level, how a common food and food preparation like a banana-based smoothie could affect the availability of flavanols to be absorbed after intake," Ottaviani said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study enjoyed two different smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was made with banana, which has high-PPO activity; the other was made with mixed berries, which have low-PPO activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also took a flavanol capsule for comparison. Afterward, flavanol levels in their blood and urine were measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: Folks who drank the banana smoothie had 84% lower flavanol levels than those who swallowed the control capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming 400 to 600 milligrams of flavanols each day for cardiometabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're shooting to reach that level, go heavy on the berries when your smoothie is made of ingredients like pineapple, oranges, mango or yogurt -- and skip the banana!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ottaviani said the findings could open the door to more research on how food prep affects nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea, for instance, is a major dietary source of flavanols, and how it is brewed could affect levels of the compounds available for the body to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by a grant from Mars Inc., which helps researchers study the potential health benefits of cocoa flavanols.

This study didn’t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/fruit-based-ingredient-may-help-fight-gum-disease-naturally-scientists-discover" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fruit-based Ingredient May Help Fight Gum Disease Naturally, Scientists Discover;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit-based Ingredient May Help Fight Gum Disease Naturally, Scientists Discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants were otherwise healthy and not taking regular medication, helping researchers isolate the effects of gum disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Researchers found that participants who received deep gum cleanings showed slower thickening of the carotid artery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is among the most &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:robust evidence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;robust evidence&lt;/a&gt; to date that oral and cardiovascular health are interconnected," Professor John Deanfield, lead author of the study and director of cardiovascular prevention at UCL, said in a statement. "Addressing periodontitis could become a powerful tool in preventing serious heart and brain events such as heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Francesco D'Aiuto, another of the study's co-authors, added that medical and dental professionals should work more closely in recognizing and addressing the cardiovascular implications of gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periodontitis affects about 40% of adults worldwide and can cause bleeding, swelling and tenderness of the gums and tooth loss if untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your gums are part of your vascular system," Dr. Catrise Austin, a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New York City;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; cosmetic dentist and host of the "Let’s Talk Smiles" podcast, told Fox News Digital. "If they’re inflamed and bleeding, your arteries feel it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Experts recommend daily brushing, flossing and routine cleanings to reduce inflammation that can affect more than just your mouth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin, who was not involved in the study, said the findings are further proof that doctors and cardiologists should start paying closer attention to their patients’ gum health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asking a simple question like, 'Do your gums bleed when you brush?' could help identify early signs of systemic inflammation long before more serious health issues arise," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients, she recommends brushing twice daily, flossing daily, getting regular professional cleanings, quitting smoking and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:managing conditions like diabetes.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;managing conditions like diabetes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These steps not only protect your smile, they also lower inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease," Austin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Center in collaboration with University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, adds to a growing body of research linking gum health to overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Lifestyle Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here For More Lifestyle Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, an analysis of more than 500,000 people in the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.K. Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.K. Biobank&lt;/a&gt;
