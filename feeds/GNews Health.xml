And deaths from alcohol-related hepatitis, a disease resulting in severe liver inflammation, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39739407/" target="_blank"&gt;nearly tripled among women&lt;/a&gt; over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6dcc85" class="body-graf"&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154235652500610X" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, similarly points to an elevated risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol-related liver disease&lt;/a&gt; among women. The condition encompasses various types of liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption. It spans early-stage inflammation to severe scarring, known as cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-825a7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related liver disease for several reasons. For one, their bodies tend to have less water weight and a higher percentage of body fat. That combination increases the concentration of alcohol in their blood, which the liver then has to process. Compared with men, women also naturally have lower levels of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, which helps the body metabolize alcohol. That again leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22a7a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Those physiological differences, combined with the sharp increase in alcohol use and binge drinking, have made women particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7982b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Historically, there’s been differences in prevalence rates [of alcohol use] between men and women. And essentially, that gap has now closed and the ratio between men and women’s drinking is almost at 1 to 1,” said Sherry McKee, director of the Yale SCORE Program on Sex Differences in Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91615b" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes in women’s lifestyles have created increasing opportunities to consume alcohol, McKee said. Today’s young adults drink less compared with previous generations, but there are now more women in college than men — and college is generally associated with increased alcohol consumption, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72cef" class="body-graf"&gt;“You pair that with the fact that women are delaying childbirth, delaying marriage — it just gives more space for women to continue drinking in the post-college years,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2b205" class="body-graf"&gt;Women’s heavy alcohol consumption is most common in midlife, said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Some researchers attribute the trend to stress or office drinking culture, but Keyes said the main reason women are drinking more is for fun. She noted that wine and spirits are often marketed to women as luxury goods or methods of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said more awareness of the health risks of drinking could help encourage women to scale back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52632d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It isn’t the case that every single person who drinks heavily will get liver disease from it. But we do know that a proportion of those folks do — about 25 to 30%,” said Dr. Jessica Mellinger, a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health, a Michigan-based health system. The more a person drinks, she added, the greater likelihood they have of getting alcohol-related liver disease of any stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15cc54" class="body-graf"&gt;The study published Wednesday found that heavy drinkers are developing alcohol-related liver disease at more than double the rate compared with 20 years ago. The researchers suspect that’s because people vulnerable to liver disease — including women and those with obesity or diabetes — are drinking more compared with decades past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04089e" class="body-graf"&gt;“The modern American drinker looks different than it did 20 years ago,” said Dr. Brian Lee, the study’s lead author and a hepatologist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035b3b" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from a national, government-led survey to measure drinking habits and liver health in the U.S. They characterized heavy drinkers as men who consumed at least 30 grams of alcohol per day — roughly two standard drinks — and women who consumed at least 20 grams per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dfaba" class="body-graf"&gt;Among heavy drinkers, the risk of significant liver damage more than doubled over a 22-year period, from nearly 2% in 1999-2004 to more than 4% in 2013-20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382a41" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate of metabolic syndrome — conditions like obesity or high blood pressure that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke — among heavy drinkers also increased during that time, from 26% to nearly 38%. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes can cause fat to build up in the liver, thereby elevating the risk of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbdc5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It could be the situation of a perfect storm. We have an increase in alcohol consumption … alongside changing prevalence of these other [health] conditions,” Keyes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41e2d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Lee said it’s important for people to be honest with their doctors about their alcohol intake, so that doctors can decide whether to screen them for liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a11dde" class="body-graf"&gt;“Your risk of liver disease might be higher than you think,” he said. “The reality is that liver disease is silent, and most people — even with cirrhosis, which is end-stage liver disease — have no symptoms at all. I always say it’s a blessing and a curse that you need very little healthy amounts of liver to feel perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a911a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Keyes said women in particular tend to wait longer to seek medical care for heavy drinking due to social stigma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a23e77" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s really becoming this hidden epidemic where women wait too long to see someone about a really serious, alcohol-related condition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOT2ZCV3ZidlE0bWlyOGtWc2JRa3dsckp2UzhuTEFfNDNJc1NTenVFb0FucmpTX2xVNHZtS0JzUEhhZzNZR0Z1Q0FzSkFJcEFkSVZrdTZiX04za1FNM1VuNXBQanpfa2syVW5VWWoxcWRiQlRLNDJ5NDdoTHVKRndBTk9sdDd4bk5faWZXWF9OcXRDREJzX2ttVW5TMUR6Q3lSaDVxZdIBVkFVX3lxTE5CZzhwU04zVVJlX1lMSDA3bEJDMThrbVlrRUtta196QzNqZWRQRzkzazJ6eFdwb2VqMW9DcGRHOXYtMlNxd3pVQmNnNnRiYjl6OC1xMHBB</guid></item><item><title>肿胀的脚踝和血块：不健康的静脉会如何杀死你- The Telegraph | Swollen ankles and blood clots: How unhealthy veins could kill you - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPOGttTEQ1R2h1Rm9mcmN3YW52aHkwQVpJZUFFSlJHMkVpX21SMVI2YWlKbHhRMUlkTTJXd2FOTkhsbFAxZUZhcHd6LW9DZndNNDRmYmVFdGxSTjVnYlpoVUJPa2U4ZjN2WXFOUmJnVTVDLXdMRmo5Q3V3WW1vdnlpTmZFSXY1cWhnUUJWMGdsOGRVV2M0LXFFa0dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Chronic venous insufficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, CVI is a condition where the veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, “resulting in reverse flow which causes inflammation, typically around the ankles,” Whiteley explains. “The trouble is that CVI is a catch-all term which basically means that the valves aren’t working. This could be in the superficial veins near the skin surface or in the deep veins which run through your muscles.” Varicose veins may be a symptom of CVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, prolonged inactivity and family history. CVI may also occur in people who have previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT – see more on this condition below) and key symptoms include swollen, discoloured, achy, tired or tingly legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have swollen ankles and you think you could have CVI, it’s really important to get a scan because the treatments and outcomes are phenomenally different depending on whether you have CVI in the deep or superficial veins,” Whiteley explains. “It becomes a very different problem if the deep veins are involved, but fortunately – unless you’ve had DVT in the past – it’s usually superficial and can almost always be properly treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood clots form in your veins, the condition is called “thrombosis”. There are three key reasons why this happens, known as Virchow’s triad, Whiteley explains, and these are “changes in the blood, changes in the blood flow, and changes in the blood wall”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors that “change your blood” include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/30/every-cigarette-smoked-20-minutes-life-ucl-study-tobacco-uk/"&gt;smoking cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and taking the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/contraceptive-pill-myths/"&gt;contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt;, Whiteley says. The nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, whilst also damaging the inner lining of veins and causing inflammation. Meanwhile, in the pill, oestrogen is known to make blood more “sticky”, therefore increasing the risk of clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to the vessel wall can occur because of “inflammation, tumours, radiation, injury, or surgery”, whilst abnormal blood flow may occur when “you sit down or don’t move for long periods of time,” Whiteley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a blood clot forms below the knee or in a superficial vein (superficial thrombophlebitis), it’s not generally considered as dangerous and it may resolve itself, Whiteley says. However, it becomes more concerning if the clot forms in a vein behind the knee or, worse, between your knee and groin or pelvis. This is called a DVT…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Which is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein. “If a clot forms between your knee and groin, or in your pelvis, there’s a chance it travels to the heart, is pumped to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism [PE],” Whiteley explains. A PE can lead to serious complications including respiratory distress and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/dont-let-dvt-destroy-your-holiday/"&gt;Symptoms of DVT&lt;/a&gt; include throbbing pain or swelling in one leg, swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them and warm skin around the painful area. You’re more likely to get DVT if you’re over 60, have varicose veins, are overweight or have had the condition before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, DVT can also damage the deep veins. You can end up with a long-term swollen, discoloured leg, often with ulcers, which is called post-thrombotic syndrome,” Whiteley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should ask for an urgent GP appointment if you think you have DVT, or call 999 if you have symptoms such as swelling and breathlessness or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Venous leg ulcer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are open and painful sores which usually develop on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. You may develop a venous leg ulcer if you’ve previously had DVT, have varicose veins, are older, overweight or have difficulty walking and symptoms include pain, itching and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DVT can cause leg ulcers in the long term because the blood clots can damage valves in the veins, leading to inflammation which damages the skin,” Whiteley explains, whilst varicose veins also increase inflammation in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are unlikely to get better on their own and usually require specialist medical treatment to ensure they don’t become infected or lead to tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

                A new study shows people in countries with different obesity rates burn about the same number of calories.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back in the 1800s, obesity was almost non-existent in the United States. Over the last century, it's become common here and in other industrialized nations, though it remains rare among people who live more traditional lifestyles, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/24/545631521/is-the-secret-to-a-healthier-microbiome-hidden-in-the-hadza-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Hadza hunter-gatherers &lt;/a&gt;of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's changed? One common explanation is that, as societies have developed, they've also become more sedentary, and people have gotten less active. The assumption is that as a result, we burn fewer calories each day, contributing to an energy imbalance that leads to weight gain over time, &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/pontzer-herman" target="_blank"&gt;says Herman Pontzer,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of evolutionary biology and global health at Duke University who studies how human metabolism has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS,&lt;/em&gt; Pontzer and an international team of collaborators found that's not the case. They compared the daily total calorie burn for people from 34 different countries and cultures around the world. The people involved ran the spectrum from hunter-gatherers and farming populations with low obesity rates, to people in more sedentary jobs in places like Europe and the U.S., where obesity is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Surprisingly, what we find is that actually, the total calories burned per day is really similar across these populations, even though the lifestyle and the activity levels are really different," says Pontzer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And that finding offers strong evidence that diet — not a lack of physical activity — is the major driver of weight gain and obesity in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This does sort of really fly in the face of what a lot of us anecdotally assumed was driving a lot of the weight gain and obesity today," says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/deirdre-kay-tobias/" target="_blank"&gt;Deirdre Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, an obesity and nutritional epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Tobias was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different activity levels, same calorie burn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers examined data for more than 4,200 adult men and women. Study participants were given a special water to drink that contained isotopes which came out in their urine. These isotopes allow scientists to determine exactly how much energy a person expends – not just in active movement but also the energy it takes to keep our hearts beating, our nervous systems functioning and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/22/1189303227/neat-fitness-non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis" target="_blank"&gt; just generally stay alive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This allows us to get a really accurate measure of how many calories people burn per day over the course of about a week," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When they adjusted for body size, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people from populations with higher obesity rates burned only slightly less total energy per day than those from populations that weighed less. These differences in energy expenditure didn't contribute much to the differences in obesity rates among populations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may seem implausible that someone who is out foraging for berries all day burns about the same amount of daily calories as, say, your typical office worker, Pontzer says it fits with what scientists have been learning about how our bodies burn calories. Pontzer's past research has suggested that our bodies tend to adjust how we expend energy to keep our total calorie burn stable within a pretty narrow range.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So if we burn more of our energy every day on physical activity, on exercise, after a while our bodies will adjust and spend less energy on the other tasks that we sort of don't notice going on in the background," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing the message on obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new findings have big implications for obesity. If differences in calorie burn can't explain why some countries have higher obesity rates than others, then it must be something else. "And that would be diet," says Tobias, who praised the design of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's 100% the diet," agrees &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/dariush-mozaffarian" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. "And I think then the question is, what is it about the diet?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian was not involved in the study, but he says it adds to other recent research that suggests food is the biggest driver in obesity. He points out there's been a major shift in our food supply in recent decades — which is now dominated by&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt; ultra-processed food.&lt;/a&gt; In a subanalysis of the data for some of the populations, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people in countries that got more of their calories from ultra-processed foods tended to have more obesity and higher body fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For decades we've been telling Americans that you're lazy, it's your fault, you're not moving enough, you're eating too much," Mozaffarian says. "And I think what this study shows is that there's really complicated biology happening and that our food is driving this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean there's no &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5323814/exercise-colon-cancer-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;reason to exercise.&lt;/a&gt; After all, it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;good for our mental &lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt; physical health &lt;/a&gt;in so many ways that have nothing to do with weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt; But it does mean we can't outrun a bad diet. Pontzer says if we want to tackle obesity, the public health message should focus on changing what's on our plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Twenty years into recovery from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/binge-eating-disorder" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;binge eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/eating-disorder-treatment" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;atypical anorexia&lt;/a&gt;, she was done trying to whittle her physique into something it didn't want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after developing diabetes a few years ago, her doctor prescribed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-weight-loss-meds-injections-compare-costs-results-side-effects" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (or GLP-1) that helps &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/what-is-diabetes" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;curb diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. A side effect of the medication? Weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, Turner, who lives outside Washington, DC, hesitated. "I don't want to start getting into this mode where I'm like, 'Yay, I'm losing weight,'" said Turner, 57, the CEO of the Body Equity Alliance, an advocacy and coaching organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of her recovery from BED included learning to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/intuitive-eating" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eat intuitively&lt;/a&gt; and letting her body tell her when it was hungry. Cautiously, she starting taking the drug. But, even at a low dose, Mounjaro eliminated her desire to eat, which caused her to drop pounds. This worried her.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    Turner said her doctor told her not to worry about losing her appetite. That worried her.

            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"I still have a therapist and I do everything I can to make sure that I keep in strong recovery," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, who had prescribed the medication, didn't understand her concerns. "She said, 'You don't have to eat lunch.' And I was like, 'No, I need to eat lunch and dinner and breakfast and snacks.' She just doesn't get eating disorders at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d" data-toc-id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic is hitting eating disorder centers hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;one in eight&lt;/a&gt; adults is currently taking a GLP-1, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, designed for diabetes, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-ozempic-wegovy-novo-nordisk-weight-loss-drugs-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-wegovy-ozempic-no-evidence-stop-taking-works-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;, marketed for weight loss.

While originally intended for people with type 2 diabetes or chronic obesity, these drugs have been co-opted by those seeking weight loss — even if it's not medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that these medications can trigger new eating disorders, worsen existing ones, and complicate recovery. Brittany Lacour,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of clinical assessment intake at Eating Recovery Centers, with programs across the country, said the number of people who have come into ERC already on a GLP-1 went from 11 in 2023 to 31 in 2024. So far there have been 14 cases in 2025, including a 14-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West, says more and more people with GLP-1 prescriptions are being admitted with eating disorders.

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"We are seeing people who are coming into treatment with a relapse or new onset, and most of them are presenting with restrictive eating patterns, like anorexia," said Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West. She is also seeing an increase in atypical anorexia, a form of anorexia nervosa where someone is significantly restricting calories but is of average or above average weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joel Jahraus, vice president of medical services at Monte Nido, a national eating disorder treatment provider, has seen a 25% to 33% increase in patients already on GLP-1 medications when they enter treatment. Most, if not all, of them have a binge-eating disorder. "A year ago there was no one presenting for an intake on a GLP-1 and then it increased to a couple a month going back 6 months," he said. These days, Monte Nido gets around three to five patients a month who are on a GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he notes, patients often hide their GLP-1 use from the person doing the intake, typically only bringing it up when they show up onsite for actual admission. Doctors attribute their reticence to shame, embarrassment, and the fear that their medications might be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of these meds can go absolutely contrary to the goals of eating disorder treatment, so it's important to figure that out," Jahraus said. "If they are low body weight and have no other indication for use such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, there is no place for the GLP-1 meds because the medication causes further weight loss. If they are normal or above normal body weight, we go through a process to gauge if they'll be successful at stopping their eating disorders, but that comes after treatment is initiated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178" data-toc-id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I feel that I need to'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, Rose, 32, who lives outside Boise, Idaho, wrestled with restrictive eating and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glennon-doyle-describes-identity-shift-from-anorexia-nervosa-diagnosis-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt;, cycling in and out of residential and non-residential treatment programs.

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/section&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So when she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago, she finally had a "legit" medical reason to ask her internist for a prescription for Ozempic. She was elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, dietician, and therapist were not. For people like Rose, with a history of restrictive eating, the inability to be in tune with their body could be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Rose managed to persuade her internist to give her a prescription. He nervously agreed, but with strict conditions: she had to eat at least 1,500 calories a day, not exercise compulsively, and not lose more than two pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as I was meeting those goals and all else was OK, I could stay on it," said Rose, who is currently on disability. (For privacy reasons, she requested anonymity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of starting the drugs, which she injected into her abdomen, she noticed a shift. She needed less insulin, and sometimes didn't any. But more importantly, she no longer spent hours ruminating on food and weight. And her hunger disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It actually freaked me out," she said. "I wasn't intentionally restricting, but I had to force myself to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daily caloric intake plummeted to about 850 calories and then 350, which she tracked with MyFitnessPal. She did an hour of cardio every day and regularly took laxatives and diuretics, all of which she hid from her team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, of course, she&lt;em&gt; liked&lt;/em&gt; the weight loss. She couldn't help herself. As she put it, "I know I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I still feel that I need to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Dr. Doreen Marshall"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Dr. Doreen Marshall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report in Annals of Internal Medicine, in 2022 and 2023 about 24,500 emergency room visits were linked to semaglutide, Ozempic's active ingredient, primarily due to severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ozempic-stomach-paralysis-woman-says-weight-loss-drug-made-life-hell-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of Ozempic and Mounjaro, for not disclosing the risk of serious gastrointestinal issues caused by the drugs. (The case is still pending.) As of May 1, there have been 1,809 lawsuits pending against the makers of GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who stops taking the medications regains about two-thirds or more of the weight they lost on it — a widely accepted statistic that can make it hard for someone with an eating disorder to quit the drugs. But there are no studies on the long-term impacts of these drugs on health.&lt;/p&gt;

"People are often surprised to learn that routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed," said Dr. Doreen Marshall, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Many general medical practitioners receive limited or no training or education on eating disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when it comes to patients in larger bodies, who might suffer from BED or atypical anorexia. Many doctors see a heavier patient and assume they simply need to lose weight, but that's not always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're prescribing for higher-weight people what we diagnose as eating disorders in thin people," said Deb Burgard, a psychologist and eating disorders specialist, and one of the founders of the Health at Every Size framework of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The breathless hype about a drug that aims to starve people is that it starves people seemingly without a protest from the starving body," Burgard added. "From our bodies' point of view, starvation is a disaster, no matter the source."&lt;/p&gt;

Her diabetes is under control, and that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she remains vigilant so she doesn't fall back into her old habits. She began setting a timer to remember when to eat, which she had done in the early stages of her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had worked so hard for a long time to become an intuitive eater and my whole self has changed because I'm in recovery and I eat intuitively," she said. "It's just a totally different relationship with food and body. So I had to start going back to the very beginning of what I did in my recovery, and that was set timers to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Rose, she has lost about 45 pounds since starting Ozempic. After her insurance stopped covering it, she began paying $1,000 a month out of pocket for a similar drug, Rybelsus, that a family member — believing she wanted it for her diabetes — helped her procure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it," she said. She has had regular appointments with her endocrinologist, but never discussed her GLP-1 use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid May, she ran out of Rybelsus and didn't refill it; it was too expensive. Around this same time she landed in the hospital with low potassium, which doctors blamed on her overuse of diuretics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she had her way, she'd go back on Ozempic to lose another 45 pounds. She's thinking about buying some online, which won't require a doctor's prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is dangerous in its own right, as unregulated or unlicensed vendors have been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-cheaper-ozempic-sold-online-contains-dangerous-ingredients-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;selling fake Ozempic online&lt;/a&gt; or in medical spas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the World Health Organization warned about falsified batches of Ozempic; the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy identified thousands of websites illegally selling fraudulent weight-loss drugs. Worldwide, 42 people were hospitalized after taking fake injections, according to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. Some people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose knows she's playing with fire. Still, she isn't ready to give up the drug. "I feel like I'm doing better than I have in a while, but the thoughts of wanting to lose weight or take Ozempic don't ever go away."&lt;/p&gt;

Miller/Yale&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers added an NRP1 inhibitor to the mix, however, they managed to counter the amyloid beta increase that otherwise occurred in retinal tissue exposed to the &lt;span&gt;coronavirus&lt;/span&gt; spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hints at the possibility of targeting NRP1 to combat neurological complications of COVID, such as those commonly labeled brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mechanistically, the involvement of NRP1 in amyloid beta aggregation gives a specific molecular target for future investigation," Hafler &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sars-cov-2-causes-buildup-of-alzheimers-related-peptides-in-the-retina/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study showed that exposure to &lt;span&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/span&gt;, in particular spike protein, can lead to the formation of amyloid beta aggregates in both human retinal tissue and retinal organoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond shedding light on COVID brain fog, the study also lends support to the idea that amyloid beta is like a bodyguard for the brain, Hafler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-an-expert-reveals"&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; of causing Alzheimer's, these plaques are now widely seen more as indicators of underlying danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid beta is still poorly understood, but it's structurally similar to known antimicrobial peptides, and some research suggests it may play an important role in the brain's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Alzheimer's can weaken the blood-brain barrier, amyloid beta buildup could indicate the brain's attempts to fend off microbial intruders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It bolsters the amyloid beta antimicrobial hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that amyloid beta could act as part of the brain's innate immune response against viral infections," he &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sars-cov-2-causes-buildup-of-alzheimers-related-peptides-in-the-retina/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other viruses may trigger similar amyloid beta buildups, the authors point out, noting the need for more research to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hafler and his colleagues, for their part, are now conducting clinical studies in hopes of revealing whether COVID can raise long-term Alzheimer's risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our ultimate goal is to prevent long-term neurological effects of COVID-19 and explore NRP1 inhibitors and other modulators of &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;-host interactions as potential therapeutics for preventing viral-induced amyloid pathology and Alzheimer's disease," Hafler &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sars-cov-2-causes-buildup-of-alzheimers-related-peptides-in-the-retina/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads5006"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a brand of pedometer was launched called the manpo-kei, which translates as "10,000-step meter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this figure was "taken out of context" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Lancet study analysed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cardiovascular disease - down 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cancer - down 6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;dementia - down 38% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;and depression - down 22%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For most health conditions, the benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps although there were additional advantages to walking further for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person is holding a smartphone displaying a fitness tracking app while wearing white headphones and a smartwatch." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Counting daily steps has become a popular pastime with fitness trackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most exercise guidelines focus on time spent doing physical activity over step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this advice can sometimes be difficult for people to understand but the current guidelines still serve an important purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are people who swim, cycle, or have physical disabilities that don't allow them to take steps," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But she says a recommendation on the number of steps people should take could be included as an "addition" that would "prompt people to think about spreading their physical activities throughout the day". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Daniel Bailey, a sedentary behaviour and health expert from Brunel University London, says the study challenges the "myth" that 10,000 steps a day is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While 10,000 steps is a suitable goal for those who are more active, he says aiming for 5,000 to 7,000 could be a "more realistic and achievable target" for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, agrees the exact number isn't important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says "more is always better" and people shouldn't worry too much about hitting a specific target, especially on days when activity is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 03:27:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1pMVA0RzYwekdRbi1YSW9USEV6VFNyVEVrdGgya2Jkc1pkdm9FRWNUbk1SWkhEMXZBc2xHT3JZejZ4N0xjQ1FVNS1xWURWTXBxdU42WE8ta1QzQdIBX0FVX3lxTE43Q05lRUxVZ0cyaXhjWHZoMTRBMURDb1BvWG9EeUVNemN6Z0YxdTI1YmNNUTVCcUxXdmVzTDZmdXhCZk41ZC1xdFNMLUl3bW9VbmtHQmM3TE43Z3N0Mkhj</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家恳求人们尽快停止做这件事，以帮助预防血栓- AOL.com | Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1JN2lrMEp1X3FuSTJ1MVFZNUUtNXdMeUZXMnBrdndvdHEyM2Fla3l2VmpZcm1Ja09VaVlkaTI1cGV3Ql83ajB6Y1lBcHNLd0Y5YUdHejJxZ3Y5eWZ3Nkd2RnZDb0pPc0xsMnA1WEQtTC1UQnRfRXhIeWljQzhGb3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-to-quit-for-blood-clot-prevention-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots &lt;/a&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/minimum-exercise-needed-week-according-to-new-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says.

This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-long-flight-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you. For example, for some people that may involve taking the stairs over the elevator or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-make-walks-more-effective" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:going on walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;going on walks&lt;/a&gt; with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Kowey, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/simple-hydration-trick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,&lt;/a&gt; is important to prevent increased blood viscosity that can increase the chances of a clot. You'll want to check with your doctor to see how much water you need to be drinking per day and make sure you're drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/i-am-cardiologist-this-is-what-i-add-to-almost-every-meal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understand your risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many health conditions, it's important to understand your risk factors.

It’s quick, easy and a great way to get a clearer picture of where you stand in terms of your overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests can be helpful, you'll want to talk to your doctor about your specific medical circumstances and history to get a better idea of how you can take the best care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;See a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, it's always best to consult with your doctor about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-does-a-blood-clot-feel-like" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and any other medical concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are simple, non-invasive tests to diagnose a deep venous or arterial clot and good medication to treat the problem safely," Dr. Kowey explains.

Nutrients such as sugar and fat trigger signals that travel from the digestive tract to nerve centers in a flash, guiding everything from cravings to satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the thought that the brain might also monitor the trillions of microbes living in the colon sounded almost science fiction – until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence shows that chemical chatter from resident bacteria can hit the nervous system in real time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drugs-targeting-gut-cells-not-brain-cells-are-better-at-treating-depression-and-anxiety/"&gt;shaping behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, such as how much we eat, within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings sketch out a neurobiotic “sixth sense” that sits alongside taste and smell, one that keeps tabs on microscopic neighbors before they cause trouble or waste precious calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-brain-monitors-the-gut"&gt;How the brain monitors the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most gut microbes cluster in the colon, where they break down leftovers and spin out vitamins that our bodies cannot make on their own. While they work, they shed fragments of protein that swirl through the intestinal stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common of these bits is flagellin, the building block of the spinning tails many bacteria use for propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/flagellin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Flagellin&lt;/a&gt; has long been known to trip immune alarms, but the speed of immune responses is measured in hours, not seconds. A faster line of communication had to exist if the brain were to react during a meal rather than after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have now traced such a line to neuropod cells – rare sensory cells embedded in the colon’s lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than one in a thousand epithelial cells qualifies as a neuropod, yet those spies plug directly into fibers of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-offers-new-hope-for-severe-depression/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;, the major information highway connecting gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-sensors-with-big-influence"&gt;Tiny sensors with big influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/publication/1450088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuropod cells&lt;/a&gt; in the small intestine are already famous for tasting nutrients. The new work shows that their cousins in the colon carry a receptor named Toll-like receptor 5 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR5&lt;/a&gt;), best known from immune cells that watch for bacterial flagellin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When flagellin docks on TLR5, the neuropod releases peptide YY (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/peptide-yy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PYY&lt;/a&gt;), a hormone that presses the brakes on appetite, and fires an electrical burst into the vagus nerve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In laboratory dishes, roughly one-quarter of isolated neuropods erupted with calcium sparks – an unmistakable sign of activation – within seconds of flagellin appearing. Block TLR5 and the flashes vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time,” said Bohórquez, a professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagellin-and-the-vagus-nerve"&gt;Flagellin and the vagus nerve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether this microscopic relay mattered in a living animal, the scientists threaded a hair-thin tube into the colons of mice and dripped in purified flagellin. Within moments, electrodes on the neck picked up a surge of activity in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-gut-brain-communication-affect-emotional-well-being/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice, which had fasted overnight, hesitated before taking their first bite and ate noticeably less during the next hour. The effect faded after about three hours – just long enough for the gut to clear its latest load of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same experiment was run on mice genetically engineered to lack TLR5 only in neuropod cells, the nerve stayed quiet and the animals &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-do-some-foods-seem-irresistible-the-answer-is-in-your-gut/"&gt;kept eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these mice gained weight even though their hormones, blood sugar, and gut inflammation stayed normal. Removing a single receptor from a tiny population of cells had quietly lifted a brake on food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dissecting-the-gut-brain-pathway"&gt;Dissecting the gut-brain pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steps in the circuit line up like dominoes: flagellin binds TLR5 on a neuropod cell, the cell releases PYY, PYY hits Y2 receptors on nearby vagus endings, and the electrical pulse races to appetite centers in the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfering at any point – blocking TLR5, preventing PYY release, or silencing Y2 receptors – cuts the signal. The speed of the response, measured in fractions of a second, sets it apart from hormonal cues such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humans-and-dogs-share-genes-linked-to-obesity/"&gt;leptin or ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;, which rise and fall over hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By responding swiftly, the gut can keep a running tally of microbial activity and adjust intake before the next mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” said Bohórquez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut. That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like obesity or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neuropods-flagellin-and-appetite"&gt;Neuropods, flagellin, and appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery slots gut bacteria alongside nutrients, stretch receptors, and hormones as direct contributors to appetite control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the neuropod pathway works locally in the colon and talks to the brain through existing nerves, it might one day be targeted without systemic side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs that mimic flagellin’s signal, or dietary tweaks that favor bacteria whose flagellins hit TLR5 hardest, could help curb overeating in a more natural-feeling way than current appetite suppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging hints suggest the circuit may also converse with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trusting-your-gut-instinct-can-make-you-happier/"&gt;emotional centers&lt;/a&gt;. The vagus nerve reaches brain regions involved in mood, and PYY has been linked to feelings of calm after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If microbial flagellin can influence those areas too, the microbiome might steer not only how much we eat but how we feel while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-we-learn-less-we-know"&gt;More we learn, less we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used flagellin from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/salmonella-typhimurium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a species better known for food poisoning than for friendly gut housekeeping. Harmless commensal bacteria sport subtly different flagellins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do those variations tweak the neuropod response, dialing appetite up or down depending on which microbes dominate? And does the brain treat all flagellins as the same “slow down” cue, or can it distinguish between benign tourists and rowdy invaders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions will require tools that can swap microbial strains on demand and sensors that report neuropod activity in real animals during normal meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tools come online, scientists expect to map a fuller picture of how bacterial voices blend with nutritional signals to fine-tune eating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, gut bacteria can tap a lightning-fast nerve circuit that tells the brain to put the fork down by flashing a protein badge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery places neuropod cells at the heart of a freshly recognized “neurobiotic sense,” one that keeps the peace between host and microbes meal after meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09301-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 01:26:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNWU5rd3RfSzRtYmxKay03enRVdXhtTGhJdzdRX0RuSGJ6WEFNWklSclJ2Zm4yeGtwam9xWkxORWxDZXRscUZFY1gydk5JU3BURlNQSmlHMkJaVHBNSkx5X2hrZmZoeGEzaXFLS0Q5aFo0bFpSTjhINWZlUWJadXlBVUJyMFRFUUZjMmNNWUZCTGpJOHV0Q3RyTktrNk9XN3pwQmxqRUQ2YV9Wc2dlZ0M3RG1aWFY3Yl9k</guid></item><item><title>牙医正在分享他们可以通过观察患者的口腔内部来告诉患者的所有信息，并且反应令人惊讶- BuzzFeed | Dentists Are Sharing All The Things They Can Tell About A Patient Just By Looking Inside Their Mouth And The Responses Are Surprising - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNSVVrMVV3Ry0tSjRkeWotWEVRTUl5RU9mMWdnYUlzQ3VzMFA0Z1d1WHV3d2p4Ui11ZE15QnVFZmxhRERpQmZzc3hkQVVFbEtqUjYtVTRTQ2JMNkdZOW0xZDRmdHdXcjZ6aGhvMUU1Z0VVbDdqZjhtSW1UaVRqOTFkNElpSFlPZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;When you go to the dentist, you’re likely focused on matters like cavities and gum health. But dental experts can detect a lot more from your exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot about someone’s overall health can be observed just by looking in their mouth,” &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk&lt;/em&gt;, told HuffPost. “In fact, over 100 systemic conditions and many medications can have oral manifestations. This means that what happens in the mouth can often be a window into broader health issues, helping to identify problems before they escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the mouth is considered the “gateway” to the body, it can also be the origin of problems in many different bodily systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth’s microbes “can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or open root canals and travel to other parts of the body, causing infections or inflammation,” Hoss noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why routine dental checkups are so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comprehensive oral examination can provide valuable insights into a person’s overall health and lifestyle habits, helping dental professionals identify potential issues and provide appropriate care and recommendations,” said cosmetic dentist &lt;a href="https://mymanhattancosmeticdentist.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael J. Wei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly can a dentist infer about you from the state of your mouth? We asked some professionals to share what they’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Floss Regularly... Or Rarely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nighttime routines like limiting alcohol and salty snacks can help support healthy blood pressure levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key habits include taking medications, practicing mindfulness, and creating a restful sleep environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small bedtime changes can boost heart health and complement diet and exercise for better blood pressure control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining healthy blood pressure is about more than keeping your doctor happy at your checkup. It is a key part of reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke and other serious health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a heart-healthy diet and exercise may come to mind, which isn’t wrong. But it’s not just about what you do by day. Your nighttime routine plays a bigger role in your heart health than you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s right! Getting ready for bed might feel like an ordinary part of your day, but did you know certain bedtime steps may be powerful medicine for better blood pressure? We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/mary-branch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Branch, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, about how to make the most of those precious pre-sleep moments to support healthy blood pressure. And trust us, it’s easier than you’d expect (no burpees required!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you hit the pillow tonight, try these five simple yet effective tips to give your blood pressure a little extra love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Limit Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, unwinding at the end of the day might include sipping on a boozy nightcap. However, if you have high blood pressure, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol &lt;/a&gt;is especially important, says Branch. “For women, it is recommended to drink no more than one drink per day, and two for men,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While alcohol may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually make it harder to manage your blood pressure over time. Even small amounts can interfere with medications or put additional strain on your heart and blood vessels. And the more you drink, the higher your blood pressure rises. The link is so strong that one study found that each additional daily drink a person had significantly increased their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? By swapping that nightcap for something like herbal tea, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067374/chamomile-tea-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sticking to water, you’re doing your body a huge favor. In addition to helping promote more stable blood pressure, you’ll give your body a hydration boost, too. Just go for caffeine-free beverage options, as caffeine may make it hard to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-remember-your-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Remember Your Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prescribed medications to treat hypertension, it is recommended that you take these medications each day,” says Branch. This includes medications you may need to take before bed. Yes, even on nights when you feel too tired to open a pill bottle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adhering to prescribed hypertension medications is crucial for effectively managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of serious health complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, as these medications work best when maintained at steady levels in your system. Skipping a dose can disrupt this balance and potentially hinder progress. Incorporating daily reminders, such as setting an alarm or using a pill organizer, can help ensure you take your medications on time. Simple steps like keeping your medications within reach, like near your bedside or in a spot you frequent, can make it easier to stay on track—even on those long days when opening a pill bottle feels like a chore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-practice-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Practice Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Branch suggests that practicing meditation and mindfulness may be a helpful bedtime habit for healthy blood pressure. “This can help bring down your stress level and your blood pressure along with it,” she says. “Furthermore, it can help you with getting a good night’s rest, which is also important for reducing blood pressure.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientific data supports these recommendations. Research highlights the link between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051058/does-stress-cause-high-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress and higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating the importance of addressing stress for overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By taking small but intentional steps toward relaxation before bed, you can set yourself up for restful sleep and a healthier tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some additional ways to manage stress before bed include practicing yoga or gentle stretching to ease muscle tension, journaling to clear your mind, and creating a calming bedtime environment by reducing noise and dimming lights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Establishing a consistent bedtime routine can further signal to your body that it’s time to wind down, creating a seamless transition to restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-avoid-high-sodium-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Avoid High-Sodium Snacks  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking can be tempting. But if you’re aiming to support healthy blood pressure, it’s crucial to steer clear of high-sodium foods before bed. Consuming salty snacks like chips, canned soups or pretzels may cause your body to retain water. This can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8700143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium &lt;/a&gt;intake in check, especially before sleep, may help stabilize your blood pressure overnight and promote better overall cardiovascular health. Opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-snacks-dietitians-love-8775716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-sodium snacks &lt;/a&gt;like fresh fruit, unsalted nuts or air-popped popcorn. They’ll satisfy your evening cravings without compromising your blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-keep-your-bedroom-cool-dark-and-comfortable"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Keep Your Bedroom Cool, Dark and Comfortable  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creating the right sleep environment can have a surprising impact on healthy blood pressure levels. A cool, dark, comfortable bedroom not only promotes better sleep but also may support heart health by encouraging quality sleep. Conversely, data suggests that poor sleep can lead to elevated blood pressure over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To keep your bedroom comfortable, ensure your room is dark, quiet and cool.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eliminating distractions such as bright lights or loud noises and investing in a supportive mattress and pillow may also encourage deeper, more restorative sleep. These small adjustments may help your body relax and recover from the day, contributing to better blood pressure regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain healthy bedtime habits can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. And developing these habits doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or complicated. Simple strategies like limiting alcohol, taking your blood pressure medication, practicing mindfulness, avoiding high-sodium snacks and creating a comfortable sleep environment can all help promote better blood pressure. In addition to tried-and-true methods for supporting blood pressure, like exercise and a healthy diet, these easy, proactive steps can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Remember, the path to better well-being often starts with small, intentional changes. By prioritizing these pre-sleep practices, you’ll not only support your blood pressure but also enhance your overall quality of life, one restful night at a time.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken connections between brain cells play a critical role in &lt;/span&gt;multiple neurodegenerative conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-"&gt;including Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have now come up with a novel way of repairing our neural wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by University of Pisa biologist Sara De Vincentiis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-mini-brains-from-stem-cells-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes"&gt;used mini-brains&lt;/a&gt; grown in a lab to test a technique they're calling "nano-pulling", using tiny magnetic particles controlled by magnetic fields to guide axons (connective nerve fibers) into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further development, the researchers believe this approach could help restore the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigrostriatal_pathway"&gt;nigrostriatal pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a vital connection in motor control that is compromised in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates the potential of nano-pulling as an emerging technique to promote directed reinnervation within the central nervous system," &lt;span&gt;the researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Parkinson's Discovery Suggests We Could Have an FDA-Approved Treatment Already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is partially the result of damage to brain cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine. Transplanting dopamine-producing tissue has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70295-8"&gt;shown some promise&lt;/a&gt; as a therapy, but these new cells struggle to hook themselves up to host brain tissue once they're in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some gentle coaxing with magnetic particles could help fix that problem, and get us another step closer to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;effective treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg" alt="Mini-brain images" class="wp-image-168128 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery-600x303.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini-brains were used to test the effects of nano-pulling. (De Vincentiis et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Sci&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nano-pulling was shown to increase axon length and get connectors moving in the right direction. It also made the cells more stable, and produced more of the axon branches and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_vesicle"&gt;synaptic vesicles&lt;/a&gt; (tiny packages of neurotransmitters) that are required to build neuron links and eventually restore the nigrostriatal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, the magnetic particles used in the experiment have been approved safe for use in medical procedures, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans. No damage was seen in the mini-brains used by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We successfully achieved guided neurite growth, resulting in increased neurite length and branching, thereby reinforcing the versatility and potential therapeutic applications of this technique," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no cure yet for Parkinson's disease, but we're getting better at understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt; and the different risk factors involved. Like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's a complex disease, and it can be difficult to distinguish between causes and the consequences of having it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work continues to find treatments that can stop Parkinson's or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-time-drug-shows-signs-of-slowing-parkinsons-disease"&gt;slow it down&lt;/a&gt;.

				&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne illness &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html"&gt;eastern equine encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; has been detected in Massachusetts for the first time this year, state health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus was detected in a mosquito sample collected on July 21 in Belchertown, the Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-eee-positive-mosquito-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said the positive test is a reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is around the time we would expect to find EEE in mosquitoes in Massachusetts, especially after an active EEE season last year with four recorded human cases,” Goldstein said. “This is only a first finding and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal infection that has no cure. The virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can trigger brain swelling, fever, and coma, and it &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2019/08/26/massachusetts-eee-death"&gt;kills approximately a third of the people who contract it&lt;/a&gt;. Survivors can face severe neurological disabilities and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/09/09/4th-human-case-of-eee-detected-in-mass/"&gt;four human cases&lt;/a&gt; of EEE in Mass last year and one person died. Four horses were also infected last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the state, no human or animal cases have been detected in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” State epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging residents to take precautions, like using insect repellent and covering up bare skin, to prevent bites. Residents can also drain standing water around their properties and install or repair screens to help reduce the risk of bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peak biting time for mosquitoes is dusk to dawn, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning in areas of high risk,” officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxORjB5WjkteWZ1NjVQTnA1ai1nVUgzVWpXNUQ5d3dXQ0k5X1FmVVNpdV9qaFdoU0lOQVU4bVZyZ05vcVFGVEFsdUFPeUd3OVJTNlI0LU9lUWhOMldidUZhYWxLaG5vaWpvc1V1aHZnS2lTVEhSYjdUekpERmZNaUZyTHE4aGlrMGtvaEEybGpKZTg2Z2pGTlJrNjBLdENzQ0NWcGJkdUExWURLS2ctQ3ZWTEdrN1c</guid></item><item><title>香蕉和苹果都没有：科学家揭示了最健康的水果，以及为什么你应该每天吃它。- evidencenetwork.ca | Neither banana nor apple: scientists reveal the healthiest fruit of all and why you should eat it every day. - evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxOY0VteTNLR2c3Wm9GVVJ5WUxUZTlkcTVoUS1odDZzMFNpQ2N3LVBxQ1NFTGN4M3JsVmExV3VYNTZJTGZYNkc1ZjctRnpONG41amE2MU12MmRhLUVWcHlnbllsdGZGU2x5TGNDbk9CVXprSGlzbUlBRmxrODNiZjdtTmdrR21oN0VhVkR4WW1CaUF1SUxOay1ZV3pvWlNFamtrZHhOTDF1ZjZuRGUxQ0VmdmcyZmRtUE5pNkRBTWkwXzdqZXB3MjhiVTlST181Qm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A small quantity of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an asset. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some people are put off by the acidic taste of lemons, there are simple ways of incorporating them into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional in the event of digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, anti-microbial and even anti-cancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/minimum-amount-exercise-prevent-cancer-100000993.html" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says.

This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-thing-never-ever-long-175000702.html" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you. For example, for some people that may involve taking the stairs over the elevator or &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/one-change-walks-more-effective-192500444.html" data-ylk="slk:going on walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;going on walks&lt;/a&gt; with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Kowey, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/simple-hydration-trick-wish-knew-110000260.html" data-ylk="slk:staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,&lt;/a&gt; is important to prevent increased blood viscosity that can increase the chances of a clot. You'll want to check with your doctor to see how much water you need to be drinking per day and make sure you're drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/im-cardiologist-one-thing-add-132500672.html" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Understand your risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As with many health conditions, it's important to understand your risk factors.

It’s quick, easy and a great way to get a clearer picture of where you stand in terms of your overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While screening tests can be helpful, you'll want to talk to your doctor about your specific medical circumstances and history to get a better idea of how you can take the best care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/silent-symptom-could-sign-heart-212500281.html" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;See a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When in doubt, it's always best to consult with your doctor about &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heres-exactly-blood-clot-feels-233000317.html" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and any other medical concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are simple, non-invasive tests to diagnose a deep venous or arterial clot and good medication to treat the problem safely," Dr. Kowey explains.

Will tinkering with nature like this have lasting consequences? And is the product of three distinct parents even human?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Development of the procedure, known as mitochondrial donation, has proceeded cautiously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4855617/" rel&gt;over decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The aim has not been to create hybrid creatures but to prevent horrific disease linked to mitochondria, the microscopic power generators in the mother’s egg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mitochondrial disease is, in fact, devastating, affecting about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/mitochondrial-disease" rel&gt;1 in 7,000 live births&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Children can experience developmental delay, profound muscle weakness, hearing loss, blindness, strokes, and heart failure. Different types have been identified, and those with the worst symptoms die earliest, often before the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403843/" rel&gt;age of 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. By contrast, children with mild or late-appearing symptoms can live full lives with few health setbacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid mitochondrial disease, then, the aim is to transfer the combination of mom and dad’s DNA from a fertilized egg with sick mitochondria into an egg with healthy mitochondria stripped of its own DNA.

"The effect of the medicine goes away, and people tend to go back to where they started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Patients who had taken GLP-1s tended to lose more weight during treatment, which meant they had more weight to gain back afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It’s not that the medicine didn’t work,” Aronne said. “It’s that they lost more weight, so they had more weight to regain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Even participants who continued healthy eating and exercise habits after stopping medication experienced weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That doesn’t mean those efforts weren’t worthwhile, Aronne further explained, but rather that obesity is a chronic disease with complex biological drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You wouldn’t stop insulin and expect a person’s blood sugar to stay low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers noted several limitations, including a small number of included studies and a focus on weight and BMI without tracking other health markers like blood sugar or cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These medications may not right for everyone, and decisions about starting or stopping should be made with your doctor, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html" target="_blank"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People with certain medical conditions, including a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer, may not be good candidates, and should speak with their doctor to decide what management strategies are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Alexandra-Elise Dakaud Patterson, MD, MS, is a general surgery resident at &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.utoledo.edu/policies/utmc/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Toledo Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOSlhQSk51Q3o3Nml4T2hTSFJqRVR0cTUzVUFoXzhtT0s4MWNnZFlaNlcxYm9kX1BfbVBBdTBXeEtlY19ualRiUk5ZeWhSRUZqeVlyZy1Qb016N19jREpCSG5zMVEtQnlSMUs4VzhTOGFRZ3VCYThuOVRyZDZidjVZT01XdW80a3BJVkxsUTllRndmZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxQbmlWcUs5emRzQ3BWaFdWTm5MSWhsal8tVUtFeGdWbk9MTVJrdGdvdVc1Y3phcUU0ZjF0cXo3Z1pTb1R3YnlXbHJLZzlSYnRvWFYwYTZUQ2t6NGJ0QmdXOExRdjkwcVd5UDBNc2o5eDB0OUI0MlpORjlPY0x2ZVgyUkRHS1M5NFQ5Um0tZEtmZkdYbWwtRXg4</guid></item><item><title>几个月来，医生对女性的常见症状不屑一顾......直到他们发现她患有致命的结肠癌-每日邮报 | Doctors dismissed woman's common symptoms for months... until they discovered she had a deadly colon cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-5372d5f0-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; woman was diagnosed with deadly &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5369d540-67e2-11f0-b40f-8703ab171d7d"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; after being dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rylie Toomey, 27, was in the midst of planning her wedding and training for a half marathon when she was struck with unbearable abdominal pain in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She rushed to the hospital, where doctors performed a CT scan and insisted she was just constipated before sending her home.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told her the same thing when she returned every few months for testing, until she ended up in the emergency department screaming in pain this past April. She was also suffering from a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'In my head I was like, I think I'm going to die - that's how much pain I was in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I was being stabbed, and my belly was super bloated, too. It felt like I was just going to explode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey had suffered a perforated bowel, meaning there was a hole in her intestinal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that hospital visit, another CT scan detected stage four colon cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs - and she became one of the thousands of young Americans who have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;been diagnosed with colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; despite living healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rylie Toomey, pictured here with her fiance, was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer at 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey is one of the thousands of healthy Americans under 50 to be struck by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/woman-colon-cancer-symptoms-dismissed-rcna219654"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'When you hear, "You have cancer," you're just like, that can't be right. That can't be me because leading up to this, I was so healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To hear that I had colon cancer just didn't make sense, just because you feel like colon cancer is linked to unhealthy people or people who eat unhealthy or the elderly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just was not expecting that at all.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1999 to 2018, the rate of colorectal cancer in the under-50 population rose from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses in 20- to 34-year-olds is set to increase by 90 percent between 2010 and 2030, and rates for teenagers have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14623503/common-healthy-superfood-cancer-link-surge-rates.html"&gt;diet, lack of exercise and a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; have all been blamed, though these causes fail to explain why physically fit people like Toomey have increasingly been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest evidence, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;published in April&lt;/a&gt;, also suggests childhood exposure to a toxin released by E. coli bacteria could increase the risk of colorectal cancer by triggering inflammation and altering the balance of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14659567/habit-millions-daily-colon-cancer-death-rate-study.html"&gt;linked to colorectal cancer &lt;/a&gt;in a recent study, as it is thought to block tumor-suppressing cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey told TODAY.com that she regularly plays lacrosse, runs and cycles and sticks to a healthy diet. She also has no family history of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toomey, here with her fiancé, is having treatment and has pushed her wedding back a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed like Toomey, after a bowel-related emergency often caused by the tumor growing, recent research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is now receiving chemotherapy every two weeks and regular immunotherapy infusions, with eight treatments left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment forced her to push back her wedding, which was supposed to take place last month, and schedule it for June 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It's definitely something that keeps me going right now. It's kind of hard to stay positive in situations like this, but this is something that's bringing me joy and keeping me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Friends have &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/rally-for-rylie-support-rylies-fight-against-colon-cancer"&gt;set up a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toomey is also urging other young people with symptoms to get checked out immediately and push for answers, even if doctors are dismissive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I just don't want anybody to ever go through something like this.

              &lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;What if you could lose weight with a drug that won’t make you lose your lunch at the same time? New research shows it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Kentucky, and other institutions say they’ve found a potentially novel way to suppress people’s appetite and treat obesity—without causing the nausea or vomiting commonly experienced with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy). In early animal experiments, the team’s experimental drug appears to be working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs&lt;/a&gt; mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which is important to regulating our insulin production and hunger. As effective as these medications are at helping people lose weight, they have their tradeoffs—most notably a high chance of gastrointestinal side effects. So there’s clearly still a need for improved obesity treatments, according to lead study author Caroline Geisler, an assistant professor at UKY’s College of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geisler and her team have been exploring one particular strategy for treating obesity, involving a protein called octadecaneuropeptide, or ODN. ODN is produced by the brain’s glia, specialized cells that support neurons. But glia aren’t just the brain’s support troops, and ODN seems to be important to controlling our sense of hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Now we know that [glia] play a large role in sensing and communicating the status of the body, and we hope that by targeting a glial signaling molecule, we can engage many energy-regulating pathways in the brain and avoid the side effects of nausea and vomiting,” Geisler told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers first tested their hypothesis by delivering ODN directly to the hindbrain of rats. Once treated, the rats lost weight and improved their blood sugar control. And when they blocked ODN signaling in rats, the animals exhibited a weaker response to GLP-1 treatment (suggesting its effects are at least partly tied to ODN).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, they indirectly dosed mice, rats, and shrews with an experimental drug derived from ODN, called TDN. In mice, TDN improved blood sugar control; in rats, it caused weight loss without nausea or vomiting; and in shrews (animals commonly used to test motion sickness and vomiting), the drug triggered no puking at all. The drug also appeared to not have any noticeable effects on the animals’ heart rate, movement, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This paper shows for the first time that giving a smaller version of ODN in the periphery is still effective to improve body weight and metabolic control without side effects,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu6764"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine, are only a proof of concept for now. There remain many questions about exactly how ODN works in the brain to tamp down our appetite and control blood sugar. It’s also possible that ODN-based drugs can be further optimized for medical use, though TDN seemed to produce steady weight loss in animals for at least over a week without waning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers are hopeful this potential new drug class can match or even surpass the effectiveness of today’s GLP-1 therapies while being less of a hassle to take. And they’re now planning to develop such drugs for testing in people. “We have an optimistic timeline that we could be ready to start clinical trials within 2 years,” Geisler said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers are hardly the only ones working to introduce the next generation of improved obesity and diabetes treatments.

This caused mice to suffer MS-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness, loss of movement and the ability to coordinate muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This mirrors the process observed in individuals with multiple sclerosis, where the myelin sheath also degrades because the immune system misfires and starts to attack the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say their findings could indicate a link between HSV-1, which is different from the HSV-2 virus that causes genital herpes, and MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deepak Shukla, a professor of molecular virology at UIC and the study’s lead, said: 'Our findings enhance our understanding of how viruses develop and offer potential avenues for mitigating viral-induced [nerve cell] damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are infected, then your immune system is constantly locked in battle with the virus. And if for any reason you become immunocompromised, the virus can escape and damage your brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have warned over a potential connection between oral herpes and multiple sclerosis (stock image, there is no suggestion that the above patient has herpes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral herpes is an extremely common condition that infects about 47 percent of adults, according to the CDC, or 124million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread via sexual contact, such as kissing and oral sex, and is incurable, normally lying dormant and triggering occasional flare-ups of sores on and around the mouth and lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cells, it is controlled by the protein optineurin, which stops an infection from spreading and protects against any potential myelin sheath damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have previously established that one of the biggest risk factors for MS is an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a virus that has infected 95 percent of adults and which is estimated to raise the risk of MS by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And other herpes viruses, like the ones that cause chickenpox, shingles, and human herpes virus 6, have also been linked to the onset and worsening of MS, which affects 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And MS is a debilitating, incurable autoimmune condition that affects the brain and spinal cord and leaves people with mobility issues, memory loss and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In earlier studies, Dr Shukla’s team found that HSV-1 triggered a strong immune response in the brains of mice, causing memory problems, poor coordination, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that the protein optineurin helps fight the virus by slowing its growth and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest study, researchers infected mice that could not produce the protein with the oral herpes virus in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers only tested herpes simplex virus-1, or the virus that causes oral herpes. This differs from the one that causes genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As seen in earlier cell tests, mice without optineurin had higher infection rates after four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that a protein called MLKL, or Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein, which is made by the body during cell death, boosted HSV-1 infections in the absence of optineurin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the protein facilitated the transportation of the virus into a cell's nucleus, speeding an infection, and optineurin controlled HSV-1 infection by triggering the deterioration of MLKL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Imaging studies revealed extensive clumping, or aggregation, of MLKL in the brains of optineurin-lacking mice, but not in control mice, in response to HSV-1 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, these clumps appeared to trigger the death of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, or cells that create armor, or the myelin sheath, around neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the sheath, the nervous system was left vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting damage disrupts the communication between the brain and the rest of the body, leading to the various symptoms associated with MS, such as weakness in the legs, fatigue, coordination problems, cognitive changes, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Identifying this protein offers a new target for multiple sclerosis therapies. Already, Shukla’s lab has demonstrated that necrosulfonamide, which inhibits optineurin, can preserve nerve function in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies like these provide hope for the future of MS, and bring about the potential to enable earlier intervention or a possible cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making up about 25 percent of all lung cancer cases - approximately 58,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to his local hospital six weeks after he noticed painful swelling in his right middle finger and right big toe, giving them a club-like shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors, who recounted the man's case in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2501158"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that each tip of the affected digits were red, swollen and sensitive to touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ulcer - an open sore or raw area - had formed near the nail of the toe, turning it bright yellow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans showed that the hand and foot contained 'destructive lytic lesions,' areas of the bone where tissue had been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the man's case, the empty space has been 'completely replaced' by more tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a form of x-ray called a radiograph, doctors diagnosed the man with acrometastasis, a rare instance in which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14725211/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-health.html"&gt;cancer spreads to bones&lt;/a&gt; below the elbow or knee like the hands or feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the man's finger (left) and his toe (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows X-rays of the man's finger (left) and toe (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrometastases only account for about 0.1 percent of cancer cases that have spread to the bones, recent studies suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, like the man's, it's seen in patients who already have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in some instances, symptoms of acrometastasis are the first signs of undiagnosed cancers, such as those in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, genital and urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also much more common in men than women, a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8471162/"&gt;2021 review&lt;/a&gt; suggests, largely because lung cancer is more prevalent in men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, cancer that has spread to the fingers and toes reacts like gout or osteomyelitis - a bone infection - which cause inflammation, redness and swelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that acrometastases are so rare because, in most cases, cancer cells are drawn to bone marrow, which is found in the long bones of the arms, legs, ribs, backbone, breastbone and pelvis. Finger and toe bones, by contrast, contain much less marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The unnamed man suffered from an aggressive form of lung cancer, doctors said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the further a bone is from the heart, the less blood it gets. Lower blood flow makes it harder for cancer cells to reach the fingertips or toes, so acrometastases happen there far less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrometastases have a grim prognosis because they are generally found in advanced cancer cases. They have been associated with less than six months of survival time after diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are typically given medications to manage their pain rather than cure the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the man's case, doctors started with palliative radiotherapy, which focuses on pain relief from cancer that has spread to the bone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died three weeks later from refractory hypercalcemia, dangerously high calcium levels in the blood that don't respond to treatment, a common  complication in cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Over time, he shed more weight, reaching 176 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3408de" class="body-graf"&gt;“My goal from the beginning of this whole journey back in February of 2023 was, bluntly, to win back my life. It was never about the weight, never about the bodybuilding, never about looking good,” he says. “It was very much about (how) I was told that I wouldn’t live past 40, and that didn’t sit right with me, and I wanted to get rid of all the diagnoses.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-8ef98d"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1770" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-02-355b49.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-02-355b49.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-02-355b49.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-02-355b49.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-02-355b49.jpg" alt="Since losing weight, Kevin Goode doesn't take any prescriptions and no longer has sleep apnea.

One of the trainers in the gym approached Goode and suggested he consider participating in a bodybuilding competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c02f4d" class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like ‘Have you ever thought about doing a show?’ and I was like, ‘No, I just love it here and I come for the health aspect,’” Goode recalls. “That’s when I looked into the transformation competition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dca970" class="body-graf"&gt;A transformation competition generally focuses on people who have lost weight. Goode will compete in October in Chicago. As part of his preparation, he has focused more on lifting and less on cardiovascular exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c2f8e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Instead of doing 45 minutes of strength training and 30 of cardio, it’s more like an hour strength training and maybe 15 minutes cardio,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d4c9d" class="body-graf"&gt;This caused him to gain some weight, and he’s now at 210 pounds, but it’s “more muscle.” His diet has changed, too, and he focuses on counting macronutrients. He still eats a lot of protein, but with lower-fat foods and now incorporates complex carbohydrates into his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad7ca6" class="body-graf"&gt;Losing fat while gaining muscle has changed his outlook on calories and how important they are for energy, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2fd10b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1759"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/nurse-loses-270-pounds-zz-250723-04-a78c42.jpg" alt="Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since losing weight, Kevin Goode appreciates all the non-scale victories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Goode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-768d16" class="body-graf"&gt;Since losing weight and transforming his body with lifting, Goode feels he’s become “more emotionally intelligent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b147" class="body-graf"&gt;“I share a lot more about myself,” he says. “I’m 20 times more confident than I have ever been in my life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9397c2" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead, Goode shares what worked for him when it came to transforming his body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-122586" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Nutrition Is Going To Be Your Biggest Thing’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b4ee1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating fewer calories than he burned, what’s known as a calorie deficit, helped Goode shed the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7e8d6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Nutrition is going to be your biggest thing,” he says. “The biggest advice as far as actually losing weight is just (being in) a calorie deficit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-90506a" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Fall in Love with the Small Wins’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13713b" class="body-graf"&gt;Focusing too much on the scale can feel overwhelming. People might think they look great, but the scale shows their weight increased slightly. Instead of focusing on the numbers, Goode urges people to “fall in love with the small wins.” Goode keeps a running list of his in his notes app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25ab9" class="body-graf"&gt;“I don’t have to pick up my foot to tie my shoe. I can just bend over,” he says. “I always made a joke that laptops are not laptops. There’s no way that is sitting on my lap.

But of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the 70 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the United States over the past 18 months, only a single death occurred, leaving experts &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/02/bird-flu-h5n1-mild-cases-mystery/"&gt;puzzled at how to explain the phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study published Wednesday adds weight to an argument that the immunity people have developed to the virus that caused the most recent flu pandemic, an H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009, has induced some cross-protection that may be making it harder for H5N1 to infect people, and mitigating the severity of the ensuing disease when such infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw4856" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, reports on a number of studies done in ferrets, the closest animal model for what happens when humans are infected with influenza. It showed that while H5N1 is lethal to ferrets with no immunity to influenza, animals that have previously been infected with influenza A — either H3N2 or H1N1 — appear to have some protection when they are later exposed to the bird flu virus. The protection is particularly strong with H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seema Lakdawala, one of the authors of the study, said the findings provide hope that, should H5N1 — long considered a major pandemic threat — acquire the ability to spread easily to and among humans, the resulting pandemic might not be as disastrous as people have feared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, most people will not die when they come into contact with the virus because they have some prior H1 immunity from infection or an H3N2 immunity from infection,” Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology and co-director of Emory University’s Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens, told STAT in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Traditionally influenza research in ferrets has been done in naive animals — those that have never been exposed to flu viruses. But increasingly scientists are using animals that have experienced previous flu infections, because they more closely resemble what might happen with humans during infection. People experience numerous exposures to flu viruses — or flu vaccines — over the course of a lifetime, building up an array of immune defenses to the ubiquitous viruses. But flu viruses evolve constantly, acquiring the ability to evade human immunity in the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this study, which was done primarily by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University, blood from ferrets that had recovered from infection with one type of flu virus — H1N1, H3N2, or influenza B — was studied to see if the animals had developed antibodies that would react to and potentially protect against H5N1 viruses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, animals were sequentially infected with various combinations of two of the three types of viruses, to see if some combinations developed more robust immunity to H5N1 than others. Influenza B viruses appeared to offer no protection, but ferrets infected with the two influenza A viruses fared better against H5N1, which is also a flu A virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the surface proteins of H1N1, the neuraminidase or N in its name, bears some similarities to the neuraminidase carried by H5N1 viruses, leading some experts to theorize that it might offer some cross-protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/1/23-0756_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A study published last year&lt;/a&gt; by scientists in Hong Kong explored the idea, looking for antibodies that recognized H5N1 in the blood of people who had been infected with the H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009. Most of the samples tested had high levels of cross-reacting antibodies. By comparison, fewer than half of blood samples stored from before the 2009 pandemic had low levels of antibodies that responded to H5N1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of that paper, said the new research and other recent studies support the idea that previous infection with H1N1 induces some protection against H5N1. But this study cannot determine what the mechanism for that protection is, he noted. More research on this is needed, Peiris said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Troy Sutton, one of the senior authors of the new paper, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say to you ‘This is the protein. This is the magic one,’” Sutton, a virologist and associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State, said in an interview. “When you get infected with a flu virus, there are multiple immune mechanisms involved in clearing that virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While all of the experts who spoke with STAT about the paper described the research in glowing terms, not everyone is convinced human immunity to the seasonal flu virus H1N1 explains the relative lack of severe disease in the H5N1 infections in the U.S. over the past year and a half, as the virus has moved through dairy cattle and poultry operations in multiple parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a leading influenza scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is among those who are skeptical, pointing to H5N1 infections in Cambodia, which has reported &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON575#:~:text=Between%201%20January%20and%201,influenza%20A(H5N1)%20virus." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;27 cases since 2023&lt;/a&gt;, 12 of which have been fatal. The version of the virus circulating in that country is different from the one that has been infecting cows and poultry in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawaoka believes a number of other factors may explain differences in the severity of cases, including differences in the viruses, the way dairy workers and poultry cullers are being infected — often, it seems, with virus entering their eyes — or the ages and underlying health of the people who are being infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, a flu expert who heads the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/global-impact/influenza-research-response/world-health-organization-collaborating-center-influenza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collaborating center on influenza in animals&lt;/a&gt; at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, shares Kawaoka’s views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to downplay the study because it’s an important study. But it’s just explaining a part of the puzzle. It’s absolutely not explaining everything we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that seasonal influenza viruses transmit just fine in the human population where there is a lot of preexisting immunity. So preexisting immunity in its own right is not enough to prevent an influenza virus from transmitting through the population.” &lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/div&gt;
						
					&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;Still, Webby acknowledged that some protection from H1N1 may be helping to keep H5N1 from making more inroads into humans. “It may be critical at this early stage where there’s a very high barrier that the virus has to overcome to infect humans. And having this preexisting immunity just makes it that little bit higher than it would be in its absence,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study as well as experts who were not involved with the work all agreed that regardless of whether immunity to H1N1 is helping to protect people from H5N1, it would be unwise to assume the threat from the bird flu virus has been vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Sutton and Peiris noted that the last two flu pandemics — the 1968 H3N2 pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic — emerged at a time when most humans had some immunity to either part of the pandemic virus or to a related virus. Prior to 1968, H2N2 viruses circulated. And prior to 2009, different H1N1 viruses circulated for 80 of the previous 91 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pandemics — the 2009 pandemic and the 1968 pandemic — both those pandemics occurred in the context of widespread preexisting immunity,” Sutton noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lakdawala also pointed out that while ferrets can answer some questions about influenza, they cannot fully replicate what would happen if a new flu virus entered a population of humans, infecting the old and the young, people battling cancer, or chronic illnesses like diabetes or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Sutton noted that flu viruses are always changing, which could mean something seen now, with contemporary versions of the virus, might only be true now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this work to me says, yes, preexisting immunity seems to be a factor in protecting against infection and disease, the virus with a few changes could potentially get around that,” he said. “These viruses have very clearly shown an ability to expand their host range.

Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor (if possible), followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The disease &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/john-mccain-brain-cancer-journey-glioblastoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is considered a highly invasive tumor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;is considered a highly invasive tumor&lt;/a&gt; in the central nervous system because its cells reproduce extremely quickly. Those who are diagnosed with the malignant tumor have a median survival rate of about 14 to 14.5 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his diagnosis, Trotman was referred by a friend to The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at University College London Hospitals (UCLH). There, Dr. Paul Mulholland, a consultant medical oncologist, recruited Trotman to be the first patient in his clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved him receiving the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab to treat his glioblastoma before undergoing any standard treatment. Afterward, Trotman began radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” Mulholland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Ben and Emily Trotman&lt;/p&gt; Ben and Emily Trotman on their wedding day in 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months after being the sole participant in the clinical trial, Trotman, now 43, is tumor-free, and his scans have come back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumour that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland explained. “We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumour at bay, and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulholland added that his goal is to find a cure for the “devastating disease” that is glioblastoma, and he’s hoping to move forward with additional patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trotman is now married to wife Emily, and the couple welcomed daughter Mabel in April. The couple told the hospital that the clinical trial gave Trotman his life back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” Emily said. “We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. Had we not met Dr. Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We obviously don’t know what the future holds, but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,” Trotman added. “We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new father said he’s hoping that his brain cancer journey will give others hope and inspire more patients to participate in the next clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/p&gt; Dr. Paul Mulholland and Dame Siobhain McDonagh&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/people/id6740392789" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The PEOPLE App&lt;/a&gt; is now available in the Apple App Store!

I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret’s Trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullholland recalled meeting Margaret. “When I met Margaret, she said to me, ‘What can I do to support you to cure this disease?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am incredibly grateful to her and to Siobhain, whose campaigning and fundraising in her sister’s memory has led to this new clinical trial opening for patients with this most aggressive form of brain cancer that has such a poor prognosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-s-deadly-brain-tumor-vanishes-after-taking-breakthrough-drug-11776891" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5MWWp3UXNxazkwU2dXQmlialVmSWNueVNBcUgzZHFXZmZNdEFVQWJFQ2VvR1dtb3BCeHg1TGVMSm93Ymp5ZGgxdVExcmtUTURqTGdGb001cHV1OHphdVkxYTZKZEdLNS1TREsyQ3RoODh0Sk5qOVBBVmJQOFY</guid></item><item><title>医院表示，儿童在感染脑吞噬变形虫后死亡- WSB-TV | Child dies after contracting brain-eating amoeba, hospital says - WSB-TV</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSB-TV</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:56:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPMC1YTnREQ0hJYzZCMy1lTi1vWVl0aWNBVTM3YTVtVkpocW9HZDNxSkZna1laTHREOTIyNzlxcGJfLW9LWnFJZ0NhSGJVbko1ZGlDQldtdEFsbDZiZ295WlFYRVQxdTdqdl9JOXNWVExmWFVoOHUtX2hjbGplUGJRdUVJbkp3bzgwV3hVSGFJU0MwU0Z2aEZXNFNvUTUzdl9LNHBBTGdWalJybnZ3MFZNTUw3NWI0Nlk5dDZTamQ1NVrSAdQBQVVfeXFMUFBSdlFHS1hRekdpSFRvMUFMbWpocVpYbFk1RXdUSWdXSGFDNVM1NlFpb3pwTTByTkt2T05GVmdocWNhamRrSWdfVUhmRHpWWTcyNkRtblp5N080cUdYU1JJVFBhdzRQaGdBV1p4ZmxvMzNSNjRNYUNOa2RTaFBPbkRhWHpacll5MzR4Z1Z6OVpWVnBsSVg3X2Y3eU9mQ1FVSzJranZDamF3ZlYtVnpYZ1hqVGYwQi1WWmVHUWplTkpPLUtVRURJNnVDSlNaeElqdkh3elE</guid></item><item><title>医生发现最致命癌症之一的新预警信号--《每日邮报》 | Doctors discover a new early warning sign for one of the deadliest cancers - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have discovered a new marker of one of America's deadliest cancers - opening up the opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-1f0a5f30-67cf-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - San Diego looked at mice who were genetically engineered to mimic the early stages of pancreatic cancer, which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14832361/oregon-man-symptoms-terminal-cancer-fatigue-weight-loss.html"&gt;kills nearly nine in 10 patients within five years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at cells under a microscope, they found cell stress and inflammation could be early warning signs of the disease as it can cause cancer cells to activate the protein STAT3, which has been shown to help tumors survive and resist treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;STAT3 then turns on the protein Integrin β3 (ITGB3) in mouse and human cells, which fuels the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes PDAC to spread faster and become more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation and cellular stress cause by chemotherapy also activated STAT3, increasing ITGB3 expression and further spreading the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the findings, researchers believe blocking STAT3 could stop tumors from forming while pancreatic cancer is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because most pancreatic cancers are only diagnosed after they have already spread, this could improve the overall survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Dwars of Iowa (left) and Holly Shawyer of North Carolina were both diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David Cherish, study author and pathologist at UC San Diego, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/pancreatic-cancer-early-warning-sign-screening-treatment-2102247"&gt;told Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Given the fact that STAT3 plays such an important role in many cancers and the fact that it controls so many genes prompted us to drill down on which genes in particular are associated with cancer development, progression and drug resistance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also noted the findings could lead to early treatments fo lung, breast and skin cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a857a910-67c9-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-a85dc390-67c9-11f0-abf9-1b65075d2f7a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time it reaches stage four, the five-year survival rate is just three percent, making it virtually incurable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00781-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007818%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;, researchers genetically engineered mice to have a mutation in their KRAS gene, which raises the risk of lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was done to help mimic early pancreatic cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found in the presence of inflammatory proteins and stress induced by low oxygen levels - which makes cancer cells more invasive and treatment resistant - STAT3 activates ITGB3 in both mouse and human pancreas cells, which accelerates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This created a harmful loop between STAT3 and ITGB3, which caused tumors to become more aggressive and spread more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart shows survival rates for pancreatic cancer, per the National Cancer Institute &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, when researchers used cancer drugs to target STAT3 early, cancer development slowed and became less aggressive, keeping it from spreading to other organs and becoming more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In total, STAT3 induces the expression of 10 genes, including ITGB3, which form a gene signature the researchers dubbed 'STRESS UP.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes detecting the STRESS UP signal early can help predict whether precancerous cells will turn into pancreatic cancer and determine how aggressive a tumor may become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cheresh said: 'Having knowledge of this gene signature in patients could be valuable since there are known drugs on the market for other diseases that block STAT3 activation and thereby inhibit the expression of the STRESS UP genes in cancer cells.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted STRESS UP could be used to help develop early screening tools for pancreatic cancer, as there is currently no way to test for it until symptoms develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team now plans to explore molecules that could stop inflammation from activating ITGB3 not only in pancreatic cancer but also other forms of the disease that can affect the surface of tissues. These include lung, breast and skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When will the new vaccines be available?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec94bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The uptick in cases comes as many Americans have likely gone a year or longer without a Covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-287d84" class="body-graf"&gt;In May, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-picks-new-strain-fall-covid-vaccines-means-shot-rcna208726" target="_blank"&gt;asked drugmakers to update their Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to target the LP.8.1 strain, a descendent of JN.1, which began spreading widely in 2023 and is another offshoot of omicron. LP.8.1 currently accounts for 31% of all new cases, per the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c5fc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The new shots won’t be available until the fall, and are expected to be approved only for adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness. Healthy kids and adults who want a shot may have to find an older version or pay out of pocket. A single dose can cost &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;as much as $140&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44b44b" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say, however, that population immunity — whether from vaccination, prior infection or both — may shield much of the public for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-948229" class="body-graf"&gt;“While we don’t have a lot of high level of immunity in the population right now, because it’s been so long, we may have enough low level immunity to just make it a little bit harder for that virus to transmit easily from person to person,” said Andy Pekosz, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bb3ea" class="body-graf"&gt;Indeed, weekly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/covid-net/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalization rates&lt;/a&gt; have remained low, suggesting that the new variant may not be leading to severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed611c" class="body-graf"&gt;The number of cases are still drastically lower than those this time last year, when the test positivity rate &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_select_testpositivity_00" target="_blank"&gt;peaked in August &lt;/a&gt;at 17.9%.

However, he believes that if there is a summer surge of cases, it will be a small one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4b288" class="body-graf"&gt;“The variants have been around for a while and haven’t caused any major surges up until date,” Pekosz said. “So again, I’m hopeful that if we see a surge, it’ll be a low level surge compared to previous years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7993af" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said people who are at high risk of severe illness still may want to consider getting a Covid shot, if they can find one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfc73" class="body-graf"&gt;High risk groups include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-cea065" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with weakened immune systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16672e" class="body-graf"&gt;Getting a shot is especially important, Levy said, for those who haven’t had one in over a year and whose immunity has likely waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-012f4d" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re in a high risk group and you’re in a state where cases are rising, you may want to just get the first available appointment and get a shot to protect yourself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ca792" class="body-graf"&gt;People at high risk can then consider getting an additional Covid shot when the updated vaccines are distributed in the fall, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ba9f53" class="body-heading"&gt;Covid has two waves a year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75b348" class="body-graf"&gt;Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said people in the high risk groups may also want to consider wearing a mask during indoor activities, such as the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f60a1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Healthy adults and children may be able to wait longer before getting another shot, Levy added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69cb06" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re in a lower risk group, that’s where things get fuzzy,” he said. “I mean if you want a vaccine and your health care provider concurs and you can get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6110ec" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Michael Phillips, an infectious disease doctor at NYU Langone, said that he sees mostly immunocompromised and older adults test positive for the virus.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive function—top-down processes by which the human mind controls behavior, regulating thoughts and actions—have long been studied using a standard set of tools, with these assessments being included in national and international child development norms.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2407955122?af=R" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/children/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; in schooled and unschooled environments, published in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, raises questions about some of the assumptions underlying the way psychologists and scholars of cognitive science think about these processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of defining an innate, basic feature of human cognition, the executive functions supposedly captured in the assessments are likelier to depend on the influence of formal schooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "The cultural construction of 'executive function,'" tested children in the Kunene region of Africa, which spans the countries of Namibia and Angola, as well as children in the U.K. and Bolivia. Children in rural areas of Kunene who received limited or no formal schooling differed profoundly in so-called executive function testing from their schooled peers, or a "typical" Western schooled sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost all developmental research is done on children who live in a schooled world," explained Joseph Henrich, Ruth Moore Professor of Evolutionary Biology, whose Culture, Cognition, and Culture lab in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology oversaw the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to Kunene, he said, "We went to a place where we have a kind of natural experiment, where we have some communities with no schools and some with schools. That allows us to compare the cognitive development of the kids. And what we see is we only get the usual executive function development in the places with schools rather than in the places without. That suggests that it's really about schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"What has been taken as a very generalized thing called 'executive function' is actually really specific to a set of skills you need to navigate school and schooled worlds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing executive function, continued Henrich, often involves such exercises as memorizing lists of unconnected words. But children with little or no formal schooling might not recognize these words because such lists do not occur in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers argued, the innate cognitive functions of children who were not formally schooled were not impaired—they were simply applied differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the populations we work in, people are super good at remembering cows," he said. "They can look at the herd, they can tell you how many cows there are, they can name the cows. If you showed them the faces of cows, they can tell you who the owner is. And I bet if I did this with kids around here in Boston, they would be terrible at differentiating cows."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that executive function doesn't exist, explained the researchers. Instead, we need to recognize that what we have been measuring is not that overall control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to rethink how we approach &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+psychology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human psychology&lt;/a&gt;," said Henrich, and a lot of what is regarded as regular cognitive development is actually a product of a formal education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Kroupin, the paper's lead author and a former postdoc in Henrich's lab, elaborated, "The term 'executive function' refers to a set of capacities and dispositions that are, in large part, culture-specific."&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Kroupin, who is currently at the London School of Economics and co-directed the field studies with Helen Elizabeth Davis of Arizona State University, said, "Our study suggests that the capacities these tasks require are in part universal, but also in part culture-specific, potentially tied to formal schooling or other institutions and experiences in urbanized societies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a re-examination of terms such as "executive functions" and a more accurate understanding of what these are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can use the term '&lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/executive+functions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;executive functions&lt;/a&gt;' to refer to underlying universal capacities," said Kroupin. However, "If that is the case then we need a different term for the suite of universal and culture-specific capacities which typical EF tasks are measuring."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09283-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;highly resistant to spreading malaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal," says &lt;a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/entomology-and-plant-pathology/people/fgould/" target="_blank"&gt;Fred Gould&lt;/a&gt;, an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. "It's really exciting."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/11/05/451216596/powerful-gene-drive-can-quickly-change-an-entire-species" target="_blank"&gt;Gene drives&lt;/a&gt; are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1215/george-dimopoulos" target="_blank"&gt;George Dimopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What about consequences?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But gene drive technology is controversial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences," says &lt;a href="https://foe.org/team-members/dana-perls/" target="_blank"&gt;Dana Perls&lt;/a&gt;, senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, "the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/09/24/650501045/mosquitoes-genetically-modified-to-crash-species-that-spreads-malaria" target="_blank"&gt;suppress mosquito populations&lt;/a&gt; by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/07/20/1188631213/mosquitoes-spread-malaria-these-researchers-want-them-to-fight-it-instead" target="_blank"&gt;new genes&lt;/a&gt; that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called &lt;em&gt;FREP1&lt;/em&gt;. It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt; groups, one with the normal &lt;em&gt;FREP1&lt;/em&gt; gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that small change had big effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests "something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect," says &lt;a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/ebier" target="_blank"&gt;Ethan Bier&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. "I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really excellent work," says &lt;a href="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=2154" target="_blank"&gt;Anthony James&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be "marginally more acceptable" to people wary of genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's good to have more than one approach available," he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That means some of them are visible to the naked eye, but others are so tiny that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/microplastics-air-human-body-organs-spread/" target="_blank"&gt;you can’t even see them&lt;/a&gt; — smaller than the width of your hair or even a red blood cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCAVINHUONDNNAMWYJBIB2QNFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We’re exposed to these plastics in countless ways, whether it’s the worn car tires that release them into the air or the plastic-lined cans that get them into our food. Scientists have found microplastics in our livers, blood, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/03/microplastics-human-brain-increase/" target="_blank"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2746" target="_blank"&gt;placentas&lt;/a&gt;. And while more science is needed to fully understand how this impacts our health, there’s enough evidence for us to be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M7UEXDZQXJHM3ES3YQ7R62DU2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c09524" target="_blank"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; I conducted with my colleagues in 2024 showed that microplastics are suspected to negatively impact reproductive health, primarily sperm quality, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/im-gastroenterologist-here-are-8-tips-improve-your-gut-health/" target="_blank"&gt;digestive&lt;/a&gt; and respiratory health. The evidence suggests microplastics are potential causes of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/chronic-inflammation-is-long-lasting-insidious-dangerous-and-you-may-not-even-know-you-have-it/2020/01/17/93ab0fa2-316f-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which could increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/19/why-colorectal-cancer-rising-young-people/" target="_blank"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/01/lung-cancer-screening-southern-states/" target="_blank"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have shown a link between microplastics and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/13/dementia-risks-reduction-strategies/" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L3L2SSDVAZBIRMRIFKKXWPQ2UM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there are also effective ways to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/03/04/ways-to-avoid-microplastics-food-water/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce our exposure&lt;/a&gt; through lifestyle changes. The key is to make these slowly over time, and be realistic about your budget and routines. There’s no need to throw out all your plastic food-storage containers overnight. Overall, it’s about reducing plastic use, particularly single-use plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXJZIQ4BKZFSTIJ426HQTS3M6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what I’ve done to limit the microplastics in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2URBIMTTSZBFPMMXLFDEFACF6Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2URBIMTTSZBFPMMXLFDEFACF6Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;I avoid packaged and ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C66VGNLYLNCYPN5G4QJ2AA7AVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I know this is hard, but probably the most important thing you can do to reduce your exposure to microplastics is to eat food that you prepare inside your house, made from scratch. Plastic-related chemicals are more commonly found in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt; and fast foods, rather than foods cooked at home, and it’s not necessarily clear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZCSOQH2PORDEVIENUK5CVK3HNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I suspect it may have something to do with all the plastic packaging and the plastic used in the processing. So I try to avoid packaged foods whenever possible. When I travel, I pack my own lunch. Usually, I bring an apple and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I buy peanut butter that comes in a glass container, which I reuse for food storage and as drinking water glasses. I bring my own bags to the farmers market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IF6P4YIX3VA2LBLSTZKCLMCX4Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IF6P4YIX3VA2LBLSTZKCLMCX4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;I don’t microwave plastics or use plastic water bottles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Y3WQPCGENBE7AWOAWQE6OUO3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I mostly use glass food-storage containers. Have I thrown all my plastic out? No, I have not. But I never use them in the microwave. &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" target="_blank"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that microwaving food in plastic containers can release millions of microplastics into that food.

Instead, I use a clay rice cooker, stainless steel pots and pans, and a cast-iron skillet that was my grandmother’s. It still works great, and I can fry an egg in it without a problem. I use wooden and stainless steel cooking utensils — and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/24/black-plastic-utensils-toxic-flame-retardants/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid black plastics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="SPYLAC5COVGURPBNELRT427NF4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="SPYLAC5COVGURPBNELRT427NF4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;I follow a plant-based diet&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HTCQLEP3MVEXBJDRCJKIQI7BM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I eat lower on the food chain, sticking to fruits and vegetables. There is still a lot to learn here, but we know that chemicals are more prevalent in larger animals. So I avoid red meat and ruminant animals such as goat and lamb. I also focus on eating whole grains and beans. And this is consistent with other dietary food guidelines. I do eat some fish. I recommend eating smaller fish in general, since larger fish, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/11/healthiest-seafood-fish-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;tuna and swordfish&lt;/a&gt;, have a longer lifespan and can accumulate pollutants like mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="32EF4VB6AJHVBFXYRKZBVQOOKQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="32EF4VB6AJHVBFXYRKZBVQOOKQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;I minimize the dust in my home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUWRCKV2RVHOXKR3ATXK3WCSWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Microplastics love to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041201931952X" target="_blank"&gt;hang out in dust&lt;/a&gt;. One efficient way to decrease the amount in your home is to use a vacuum with a HEPA filter. HEPA stands for high-efficiency particulate air — meaning these vacuums are effective at removing very tiny particles around your house, including microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HS7EDYEDC5CF3KCIJMYTJZHSCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I also suggest using a wet mop or microfiber cloth to clean up around the house, which won’t stir up dust.

(WSET) — &lt;/span&gt;A woman from Bedford County is recovering after a rabid fox attacked her while she was on her porch, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Virginia Department of Health, a fox tested positive for rabies on July 21 after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fox was killed when it attacked a woman while she was on her porch in the Thaxton area of Bedford County near the intersection of Pendleton Road and Quarterwood Road," VDH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VDH said anyone in the area who may have been exposed to a fox or any other animal in the area, whether by a bite, scratch or saliva, should go to the doctor and contact the Bedford County Health Department at 540-586-7952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/natural-bridge-zoo-giraffe-valentine-dies-during-attorney-generals-office-seizure-gretchen-mogensen-july-2025" target="_blank" title="https://wset.com/news/local/natural-bridge-zoo-giraffe-valentine-dies-during-attorney-generals-office-seizure-gretchen-mogensen-july-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Natural Bridge Zoo giraffe Valentine died during Attorney General's Office seizure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This incident is a reminder that rabies is present in Virginia and sometimes infects domestic animals like dogs and cats," VDH said. "Rabies is caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system and is lethal if proper medical care is not given following an exposure to the virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common way rabies is spread is through a bite, but it can also be transmitted by saliva from a rabid animal contacting open wounds, the mouth, eyes or nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some steps you can take to prevent rabies for you and your pets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure that your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with wild animals or stray animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray animals. Avoid wild animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes and skunks. Feed your pets indoors and do not let them wander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children to avoid contact with wild animals and pets they are not familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not handle sick, injured or dead animals. Contact a licensed wildlife rehabber if you have concerns about sick or injured wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep wild animals out of homes by capping chimneys with screens and blocking openings in attics, cellars and porches. Ensure trash cans have tight fitting lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not try to trap or handle stray and wild animals. If a bat is found indoors and may have had contact with someone, do not release it. Call your local animal control officer or health department to determine if the animal should be picked up and tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report all bites to people to the local health department for investigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSET</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:40:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQWWt5eWxkQTJKd20xa0FBTE0xQ25wWHRBaldOV0M5OUhOOHlocXN3dWxhWmNYQkNBMnJ1WXRsWk0wckZiTmtOSTUzcW55ejdQOXNyQXRmT242Si1IRl9paDRwVXd0Um9DY2dOVHZYeUYxRThib0JaMHFWT3RrakNLdDFIblhBaFhmd3I0alNFWjkzM1psdUpfNzBHVTREUXlvRTRJNVV4eXNiRWhITGw0OUN2dC10RDQ3akxvSlNsY3dTc0FKUTVLdzZsSXNmSVhvRlRB</guid></item><item><title>科学家使用牙线无需针头即可接种疫苗- Medical Xpress | Scientists use dental floss to deliver vaccines without needles - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQUDFfVnlzazdWTV85eWRGSHRhS0Rpdld2cjc2X25QNjRhZ0p3MG9zSnU0UW8yb3RDZTItcXQtMTMxeWZ0SG5fZkxWMWhnOEtraG1ubjFHbmE0eUoxdTJXV3VwNUNqQ2NYR2xncUFkRGZwSU5rVWctRXNsa1djWFpwYlpFNndQVGZURmVPSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flossing your teeth at least once a day is an essential part of any oral health routine. But it might also one day protect other parts of the body as scientists have created a novel, needle-free vaccine approach using a specialized type of floss.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01451-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;, researchers demonstrated that when floss laced with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; components, such as proteins and inactive viruses, was applied along the gum lines of mice, it triggered an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of vaccine delivery is effective because the areas of gum between the teeth are highly permeable, allowing them to absorb vaccine molecules easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flossing mice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, researchers flossed 50 mice every two weeks for 28 days, which wasn't an easy task. To floss each mouse, one person had to gently pull their jaw down with the metal ring from a keychain while another did the flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four weeks after the final vaccine dose, the mice were exposed to a lethal strain of flu. All rodents that received the floss-based vaccine survived while the unvaccinated animals died. Additionally, the mice that had been flossed had a more widespread immune response throughout their bodies. Flu antibodies were detected in their feces, saliva and even in their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding antibodies in the bone marrow suggests the mice's bodies had established a long-term immune response. The researchers also saw an increase in T Cells (a type of immune cell that fights off infections) in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;'s lungs and spleen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers wanted to see whether flossing would be a viable approach for humans. So they asked 27 healthy volunteers to floss with dental picks coated with food dye. On average, the dye reached the gums about 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mouth and nose are the primary entry points for many viruses, making the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oral+cavity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oral cavity&lt;/a&gt; an ideal site for vaccine delivery. However, scientists have faced significant hurdles in developing needle-free vaccine alternatives for these areas due to the body's tough defenses against foreign invaders. A floss-based approach could bypass these challenges, offering a promising new method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods," wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative approach to vaccine delivery offers a number of other benefits. One of the most compelling is that it could improve vaccine uptake, especially among those with a fear of needles. Additionally, floss-based vaccines wouldn't require special transport and storage in cold temperatures. They could be easily delivered by mail, which would be useful for rapid mass vaccination during pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

In people with this condition, the cerebellum protrudes through the hole at the base of the skull and into the spine. Symptoms may include headaches, neck pain and dizziness, and if too much of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bulges out, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mild cases, the symptoms may be treated with muscle relaxants, whereas in severe cases, doctors may treat the condition by removing chunks of bone from the braincase or vertebra, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/about/people/faculty/mcollard.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/about/people/faculty/mcollard.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Collard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleoanthropologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovered in the 1800s by Austrian pathologist Hans Chiari, the disorder is thought to affect about 1 in 1,000 people. However, recent imaging research suggests it may be significantly more common, potentially occurring in more than 1 in 100 people — it's just that most cases escape notice because they do not manifest major symptoms, Collard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 happens when the occipital bone at the back of a person's skull is not big enough to hold the brain properly, leading the bulging portion to become pinched. However, it remains uncertain what causes the occipital bone to be unusually small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987713003599" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987713003599" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists proposed that the condition was the consequence of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/modern-human-ancestors-and-neanderthals-mated-during-a-7-000-year-long-pulse-2-new-studies-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/modern-human-ancestors-and-neanderthals-mated-during-a-7-000-year-long-pulse-2-new-studies-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;interbreeding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between Neanderthals and modern humans in Eurasia.

The 2013 study suggested Neanderthal DNA might influence modern human skull development, leading to a mismatch between the size and shape of the brain and the skull — especially the base of the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this idea, the new study examined 3D &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CT scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the skulls of 103 living people — 46 with the disorder, and 57 without. The researchers compared these skulls with eight fossil skulls of close relatives of modern humans, including Neanderthals, &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; and prehistoric &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archaeology.upd.edu.ph/people/kimberly-plomp" target="_blank" data-url="https://archaeology.upd.edu.ph/people/kimberly-plomp" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kimberly Plomp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an osteologist at the University of the Philippines Diliman, and her colleagues found that the skulls of modern humans with the disorder were more similar in shape to Neanderthals than people without the malformation. All other fossil skulls were more similar to modern humans without the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study may mean we are one step closer to obtaining a clear understanding of the causal chain that gives rise to Chiari malformation type 1," said Collard, a co-author on the study. "In medicine, as in other sciences, clarifying causal chains is important. The clearer one can be about the chain of causation resulting in a medical condition, the more likely one is to be able to manage, or even resolve, the condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collard stressed these findings do not definitively prove a link between this disorder and Neanderthal genes. "Scientific research is rarely, if ever, conclusively based on a single study," he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work could analyze more skulls, especially fossil ones, Collard said. Researchers can also focus on collecting data from Africa. "What we know about the occurrence of Neanderthal DNA in the living human gene pool suggests that we should expect higher prevalence of Chiari malformation type 1 in Europe and Asia than in Africa," Collard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research does confirm a link between Neanderthal genes and this disorder, "then it might make sense to add screening for such genes to early childhood health assessments," Collard said. That way, individuals with a higher-than-average risk of developing Chiari malformation type 1 could be identified and then monitored and managed by health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists detailed their findings June 27 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/13/1/154/8175225" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/13/1/154/8175225" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/neanderthal-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-our-closest-relatives"&gt;Neanderthal quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about our closest relatives?&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;According to new research, communication between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-one-more-link-between-our-gut-and-our-brain-that-could-help-avoid-dementia"&gt;the gut and the brain&lt;/a&gt; is sophisticated enough to be classed as a new and distinct sense – one capable of affecting our appetite and even our mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This two-way link has previously been associated with a variety &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-intestinal-changes-result-traumatic-brain-injury"&gt;of health issues&lt;/a&gt;, though the physical processes at work have never been clearly identified&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on what we already know about our digestive and neurological systems, a team from Duke University in the US traced a series of biochemical actions from the digestive tracts of mice to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091941"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Diego Bohórquez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Yo-Yo Dieting May Trigger Long-Lasting Changes in Gut Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers looked closely at the protein flagellin, which is found in gut bacteria and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.167.4.1882"&gt;already known&lt;/a&gt; to trigger immune system responses. What the team wanted to see was if flagellin could also send direct messages to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By giving mice small doses of flagellin after fasting, the researchers identified mechanisms connecting gut bacteria and the brain via colon cells called neuropods and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;. These mice ate less than they normally would, with flagellin apparently acting as a type of messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that when the flagellin-sensitive receptors were turned off in mice, those animals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-happens-in-your-body-when-you-overeat-just-once"&gt;kept on eating&lt;/a&gt; – further evidence that this signaling operated the way the researchers thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168770" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits.jpg" alt="Eating habits chart" class="wp-image-168770 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/EatingHabits-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168770" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flagellin affected the eating habits of mice. (Liu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has previously been established that the brain's response to cues in the gut &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-fat-junk-foods-might-be-messing-with-your-brain-s-appetite-control-study-finds"&gt;regulates our appetites&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argue the fact gut bacteria trigger communication that is responded to in real-time through a complex series of mechanisms qualifies the process as a novel sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies will be needed to confirm that this same sensing and signal processing is happening in humans, but there's a good chance that it is considering similarities between our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-bacteria-found-to-soak-up-toxic-forever-chemicals"&gt;digestive systems&lt;/a&gt; and those in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors are keen to expand their research to look at other types of bacteria-driven communication between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tweaking-our-gut-bacteria-could-help-protect-our-brain-from-strokes"&gt;the gut and the brain&lt;/a&gt; that might be working in the background, and to analyze how these signals might change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line – as with all research looking at how our guts and our brains are connected – the study may prove useful in understanding and treating eating disorders &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-there-are-two-types-of-obesity-and-one-is-worse-for-our-health"&gt;and obesity&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, we might be able to control this distinct sense in beneficial ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091941"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bohórquez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut.

Tumours are normally slow–growing but can kill by compressing the brain and nerves if they grow too big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2,000 and 3,000 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with a meningioma and it’s more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest study, scientists at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, compared meningioma rates in 72,181 women on the jab with more than 247,000 women on oral contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, in the journal Expert Opinion on Drug Safety, showed the risks were more than trebled in long–term users of the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researcher Dr Mahyar Etminan said the dangers did not appear to increase the more years women spent on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added: ‘I do believe the evidence is now robust, with three large studies showing pretty much the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Women concerned about this risk may want to consider opting for alternative contraceptives.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is estimated  there are 10,000 prescriptions for the jab issued in England each month &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear why the jab triggers tumour growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One theory is the synthetic hormone it uses – progestogen – binds to meningioma cells and helps them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research suggests certain versions of the Pill made with progestogen can also heighten the risk of meningioma but only in a small proportion of women who take it for more than five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK drug safety watchdog—the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency—last October called on Pfizer to include a warning about the heightened risk in patient information leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer also wrote to NHS doctors urging them to immediately stop women from using Depo Provera if they were diagnosed with a meningioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia Buchanan, partner at Levin Papantonio—the law firm handling the case in the US—said: ‘This new study reinforces the need for legal action against Pfizer, with the hope of bringing justice for the women who have never been warned about the increased risk of developing a brain tumour from using Depo–Provera and who have gone on to develop meningiomas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The way someone walks could reveal if they have autism, a top health expert has revealed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the psychologist says some of the walking styles could be much subtler, especially among those with mild autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Research has also identified more subtle differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A study summarizing 30 years of research among autistic people reports that gait is characterized by walking more slowly, taking wider steps, spending longer in the 'stance' phase, when the foot leaves the ground [and] taking more time to complete each step.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Rinehart says research has shown that the autistic gait 'persists across the lifespan' and some walking styles can become more distinctive with age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe a different gait pattern could potentially be a 'game changer' for autism diagnosis, particularly in young children, because it can be observed early and objectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with severe autism, characterized by significant challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior, might have more pronounced gait differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If someone with autism is exhibiting an altered gait, Professor Rinehart says there is often no need for intervention unless it is interfering with someone's ability to participate in everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says if the walking style could increase the risk or frequency of falls then it is advisable to seek support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the gait is preventing someone from participating in the physical activities they enjoy, they could also benefit from intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therapy for autistic gait, particularly toe walking, often involves a variety of approaches including physical therapy and occupational therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical therapy focuses on improving muscle strength, flexibility, and range of motion, while occupational therapy helps with motor skills, balance, and coordination, often incorporating sensory integration techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other options may include serial casting, orthotics, or even surgical intervention in more severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it come to children, Professor Rinehart says that rehabilitation doesn't have to occur in a clinical setting and sports and dance classes have been shown to be beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'Given children spend a large portion of their time at school, programs that integrate opportunities for movement throughout the school day allow autistic children to develop motor skills outside of the clinic and alongside peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our community-based intervention studies show autistic children's movement abilities can improve after engaging in community-based interventions, such as sports or dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Community-based support models empower autistic children to have agency in how they move, rather than seeing different ways of moving as a problem to be fixed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, one in every 31 children aged eight or younger had autism in 2022 - a rate of 32.2 per 1,000. That's up from one in 36 in 2020, and one in 44 in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, early studies from the 1960s and 1970s estimated autism rates to be as low as 1 in 5,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-eaa52260-672f-11f0-9795-0749cc429f4c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report found wide geographic variation, with diagnosis rates ranging from roughly one in 100 in parts of south &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-c86f5cb0-1a2c-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to a striking one in 19 in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say the sharp rise in recent decades can be partially explained by improved screening, increased public awareness, and better access to services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some blame an ultra-processed diet, chemicals and pesticides for the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for an autism diagnoses is five, though the vast majority of parents notice odd quirks in their children, particularly around social skills, as early as two years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking ahead, Professor Rinehart says more research needs to be done to better understand the autistic gait. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will be particularly beneficial to children so that treatment plans can be tailored for their individual movement styles as they develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study in mice, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01380-1" target="_blank"&gt;published in Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, showed that an experimental mRNA vaccine boosted the tumor-fighting effects of a common cancer drug called immune checkpoint inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anticancer reaction," Dr. Duane Mitchell, a co-author of the study and professor of neurosurgery at the university's College of Medicine, said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRK/"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, developing &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/moderna-and-ibm-to-use-ai-quantum-computing-on-mrna-vaccines.html"&gt;personalized vaccines&lt;/a&gt; tailored to each patient's specific tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The universal vaccine has the potential to be used broadly across cancer patients, "even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine," Mitchell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UF researchers are still working to replicate the findings in humans. If they do, a one-size-fits-all vaccine could provide an alternative to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells. Those cells often use PD-L1 to hide from immune attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by boosting PD-L1, the vaccine can actually make tumors more vulnerable to immune checkpoint inhibitors that block that protein, helping the immune system recognize and destroy the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed promising results on treatment-resistant tumors in skin cancers by combining the mRNA vaccine with a monoclonal antibody, a common immunotherapy drug that attempts to alert the immune system that a tumor is foreign and should be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also showed positive results when tested on mouse skin, bone and brain cancers as a solo treatment. In some cases, the tumors were eliminated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper describes a very unexpected and exciting observation: that even a vaccine not specific to any particular tumor or virus – so long as it is an mRNA vaccine – could lead to tumor-specific effects," said senior author Dr. Elias Sayour, a UF Health pediatric oncologist, in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Digital health earnings season is approaching, here's what to watch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're just days away from the peak of digital health earnings season, and this quarter is sure to be an interesting one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies that went public earlier this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health, will report results for the first time since their debut. And since President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending bill passed and his Aug. 1 tariff deadline is approaching, we'll get some insight into how digital health companies have been operating against a volatile macroeconomic and policy backdrop.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the reports CNBC will be watching for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 5 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digital physical therapy company Hinge Health will release its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 5, its first report since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in May. Shares of Hinge opened at $39.25 on May 22, and they're trading above $46 as of intraday trading on Wednesday. During its first quarter this year, Hinge &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/hinge-health-says-it-had-50percent-revenue-growth-over-last-year-in-first-quarter.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; revenue climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year, and that net income for the period was $17.1 million compared to a loss of $26.5 million a year ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-10"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/OMDA/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omada Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 7 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual chronic care company Omada Health will report second-quarter results on Aug. 7, which will be the first time the company has disclosed financials since its June debut on the Nasdaq. Shares of Omada opened at $23 on June 6, and they're trading around $19 as of intraday trading on Wednesday. Omada's revenue increased 57% in its first quarter to $55 million from $35.1 million a year earlier, according to its prospectus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-11"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HIMS/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hims &amp;amp; Hers Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – Aug. 4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers Health reports second-quarter results on Aug. 4, and executives will likely face questions about its short-lived collaboration with &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-12"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In April, Novo Nordisk said it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/novo-nordisk-wegovy-telehealth.html"&gt;offer Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; through several telehealth companies, including Hims &amp;amp; Hers, to expand access to the blockbuster weight loss injection. But by the end of June, the deal collapsed over Hims &amp;amp; Hers' sale and promotion of cheaper knock-offs. Shares of Hims &amp;amp; Hers had soared more than 100% this year as of intraday trading on Wednesday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/DOCS/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doximity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; –  Aug. 7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doximity, a digital platform for medical professionals, was one of the few breakout stars of 2024 when the company's stock price more than doubled. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can sustain its momentum when it reports fiscal first quarter 2026 results on Aug. 7. Doximity shares are up more than 13% this year as of intraday trading on Wednesday.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-15"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/TDOC/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teladoc Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – July 29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teladoc Health CEO Chuck Divita has been working to turn the once high-flying virtual care company around after four straight quarters of revenue declines and an extended stock price slump.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms can extend lifespan and reduce cellular aging by 50% in human cells and 30% in elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments reveal another potential therapeutic use of the compound—called psilocybin—which has already been studied as a treatment for a myriad of other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team from Emory University are calling it the first ever long-term study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice. The animals were the equivalent of 60 to 65 in biological human years, and exhibited hair loss and greying, as well as reduced physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were dosed with psilocin, the active ingredient in psilocybin that appears once the latter is broken down during digestion. The mice received a low level at first, and eventually with a higher dose of 15 milligrams once a month for 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first 3 months, the mice receiving psilocybin exhibited signs of youth, including fewer instances of greying and hair loss—including a reversal of these symptoms—and a general improvement in physical activity. By trial’s end, the mice that received psilocybin had a 30% increased lifespan on average than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, more than 150 clinical studies have been completed or are ongoing for examining psilocybin in the treatment of various clinical conditions, including anxiety, depression, addiction, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, chronic physical pain, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cite a study from 2020 which found that a single-dose of psilocybin can improve debilitating physical and psychological symptoms with improvements lasting up to and beyond 5 years post-dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Method behind the magic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This literature has firmly established that psilocybin acts strongly on a particular serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A, as well as several other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Notably, the 5-HT2A receptor is expressed in multiple organs and cell types, including fibroblasts, neurons, cardiomyocytes, endothelial, epithelial, macrophages, and T-cells, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are skin, brain, heart, and various immune cells in layman’s terms. In the brain, 5-HT2A stimulation was followed by the activation of one of the body’s most important determinants in aging, a pathway called SIRT1. This is heavily involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, a process by which cells that old become redundant, nondividing, and inflammatory, before eventually being cleared away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, we demonstrate that psilocin increased SIRT1 expression in cells, suggesting a potential mechanism by which psilocybin delays senescence and promotes longevity. This study provides the first experimental evidence suggesting that psilocybin may impact multiple hallmarks of aging, including delayed senescence, preservation of telomere length, [and] enhanced DNA stability,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote in their study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Partner Journal’s Aging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beyond its neurological and psychological benefits, our findings suggest that psilocybin influences systemic aging processes, potentially explaining its long-lasting therapeutic effects across multiple disease indications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also tested the effects of psilocin on human fibroblast cells from the lung &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, continually dosing them with the psychoactive compound or a placebo until they reached replicative senescence, or the point at which the cell has divided around 50 times and then stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psilocin treatment of 10 micrograms resulted in a 29% extension of cellular lifespan, characterized by delayed exhaustion of proliferative potential, increased cumulative population doublings, and decreased population doubling time. Strikingly, when increased to 100 micrograms, 29% lifespan extension became 57%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psilocin-dosed fibroblasts were also observed to have increased SIRT1 activity, and a preserved telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded their paper by describing psilocybin as a potentially “disruptive” pharmacological agent—an all-too-real suggestion considering the depth of therapeutic potential that has already been established in non-psychotic individuals using psilocybin for all manner of ailments, the reluctance of major pharmaceutical companies to explore psilocybin as a potential produce ingredient, and the sweeping illegality of psychedelic mushrooms in most of the world. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WaL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;There really is something to the concept of having a gut feeling. New research out today suggests our bodies can directly sense and communicate with the many bacteria lining our digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Duke University led the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09301-7"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. They found that nerve cells can respond in real time to bacterial signals from the gut—including signals that tell us to curb our appetite. The findings suggest the relationship we have with our microbial neighbors is even more complex than thought, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans are well known for having five basic senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste). But according to the study researchers, growing evidence points to other senses that react specifically to cues from our digestive system, the “gut sense.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the researchers had previously discovered that certain cells lining the gut can sense specific stimuli and directly communicate with nearby nerve cells that lead back to the brain, called &lt;a class="qbe-widget qbe-widget" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat5236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;neuropods&lt;/a&gt;. And they reasoned that one type of stimuli these cells detect would be the gut microbiome, the trillions of normally harmless, often helpful bacteria and other microbes that live inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We had previously found that neuropod cells in the small intestine sense and rapidly respond to nutrients,” co-lead author Maya Kaelberer, a sensory neuro-gastroenterologist, told Gizmodo. “It seemed natural to think that neuropod cells of the colon could sense the gut microbiome; therefore, we set out to find out how.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team focused on an ancient protein found in the tail, or flagella, of many gut bacteria, aptly named flagellin. Gut bacteria appear to produce more flagellin when we eat, and neuropods can detect flagellin through a receptor called the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), the researchers found. In experiments with mice, they also showed that this interaction seems to be key to regulating our hunger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the researchers gave fasting mice flagellin directly through the colon, for instance, the mice ate less than usual. They then knocked out the TLR5 receptor in neuropods and ran the same experiment, finding that the mice now kept eating and gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that increased levels of bacterial flagellin act as a real-time signal for the brain to tamp down our hunger. Neuropods catch this signal through the TLR5 receptor and then quickly transmit it to the brain via the vagus nerve. If the neuropods’ ability to detect nutrients could be considered a sixth sense, then its detection of gut microbes might be a distinct, seventh sense, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We discovered that our colon has a sense for microbes, the neurobiotic sense,” Kaelberer said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More research is needed to confirm and better understand how this neurobiotic sense operates in people, of course. But assuming it’s genuine, the discovery would have important scientific and medical implications. Certain health conditions might alter the communication between gut bacteria, neuropods, and the brain, for instance, as might things like our diets or environment. And perhaps someday, we’ll be able to safely influence this sense to treat or prevent such conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you lived in a world where everything you saw was blue—blue walls, blue ground, blue computers, blue cars… Then you come home to see a yellow/orange peach on your blue table; it would have a profound effect on your experience. Knowing this, can we target this sense to have that same profound experience without the peach?” Kaelberer said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This is still just the beginning of the team’s exploratory work. They next hope to uncover whether neuropods can also detect immune-related signals. In the meanwhile, I’ll be sure to thank my gut bacteria from now on for helping me have at least some restraint when it’s time for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Black women consistently showed the lowest levels of MVPA and were at more than four times higher risk for low MVPA after a cardiovascular event than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHODOLOGY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers analyzed data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of 3068 participants (mean age, 25.2 years) in four US cities from 1985-1986 through 2020-2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants self-reported their levels of MVPA using a validated CARDIA physical activity history questionnaire, with scores measured in exercise units (300 units approximated 150 minutes of weekly MVPA).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nested case-control analysis examined 236 cases of CVD that occurred among participants in the study. Each incident was matched 1:1 with control group by age, sex, and race, focusing on MVPA trajectories before and after cardiovascular events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKEAWAY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Levels of MVPA declined steadily from young adulthood into middle age before stabilizing, with Black men showing more sustained decline and Black women consistently reporting the lowest activity levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cases demonstrated accelerated declines in levels of MVPA within 2 years of a CVD event, with postevent gaps persisting compared with matched control group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black women were at significantly elevated risk for low levels of MVPA after a CVD event compared with other groups (odds ratio [OR], 4.52; 95% CI, 2.29-8.89).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After adjusting for levels of MVPA before a CVD event, cases were more likely than control group to have low levels of MVPA after the episode (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.26-2.50).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN PRACTICE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this cohort and nested case-control study among CARDIA participants, MVPA declined from early adulthood to midlife then plateaued, with notable demographic differences; cases experienced steep declines before CVD, and gaps, compared to controls persisted afterward,” the researchers reported. “Black women had the lowest MVPA across adulthood and the highest risk of low MVPA post-CVD, underscoring the need to support lifelong physical activity and address group differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOURCE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was led by Yariv Gerber, PhD, of the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine in the School of Public Health at Tel Aviv University, Israel. It was published online on July 23 in &lt;a href="doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2282"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIMITATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, MVPA was self-reported, which could introduce potential misclassification bias. Study attrition over the follow-up period reduced the analytical sample size, and individuals with severe CVD may be underrepresented in postevent data. The relatively young CARDIA cohort yielded a modest number of CVD cases, limiting subgroup analyses. Data on cardiovascular disease severity, cardiac rehabilitation, and other potential influences on MVPA were unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLOSURES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CARDIA study received support from the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in collaboration with multiple universities. Kelley Pettee Gabriel, PhD, disclosed receiving grants from the US National Institutes of Health during the conduct of the study. No other disclosures were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

Four additional suspected cases are currently being tested. Rabies has not yet infected any people in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Gelman declared an ‘imminent public health threat,' which means the county can allocate more resources to disease mitigation and prevention efforts. The virus, public health officials believe, has migrated from New York City, where funding for rabies infection prevention in animals in the area has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies is estimated to cause 59,000 human deaths annually in over 150 countries, with most cases occurring in Africa and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-defa2f20-67cd-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-def9e100-67cd-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, this number is likely a gross underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human infections are rare in the US, with fewer than 10 cases reported annually, largely due to widespread animal vaccinations, effective public health measures, and the availability of post-exposure care that can save patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without prompt treatment, though, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13576711/rabies-warnings-attacks-multiple-states-rabid-racoons-bats.html"&gt;nearly 100 percent of patients&lt;/a&gt; infected with the virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There have been 25 cases of rabies in animals over the past 12 months. Four additional suspected cases are currently being tested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid infection, health officials advise against feeding or touching wild animals, stray cats, or dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, they recommend keeping pets up-to-date on rabies vaccinations and keeping puppies too young to receive the vaccine indoors, only allowing them outside if someone is supervising them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also told residents to spread the word about avoiding wild animals, especially those acting abnormally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a wild animal gets onto your property, they advise people to bring pets and young children inside until the animal is removed and contact an animal control expert to safely remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they said not to touch dead or dying animals. If they need to be moved, use a shovel to double-bag them and leave them in an outdoor garbage bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies can spread to humans or pets through bites, scratches, or contact with saliva from an infected animal, particularly when it comes into contact with open wounds, eyes, nose, or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is most commonly seen in raccoons, skunks, and foxes, but three feral cats that traveled from Queens in New York City to Long Island were found to harbor the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nassau County has had successful eradication of rabies since 2016, prior to this most recent outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The map shows which are most likely to carry rabies in various regions across the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilman said: ‘There may be more cases out in the wild — because we’ve confirmed 25, it’s indicative of wider spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘First of all, [there’s concern in] the sheer volume of cases that we have seen in one year, but also the rate of spread and also, the fact that it is feral domesticated animals.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The county will continue its rabies mitigation efforts through the fall, anticipating an increase in animal cases and concerns about potential human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When someone sees a cat in their backyard, it’s not necessarily as much of a reaction as seeing a wild animal,’ Gelman added, warning that children may also unknowingly play with a rabid cat.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department plans to use a rabies vaccine bait drop along the border with Queens and throughout the county. It involves distributing edible baits containing the rabies vaccine, often by air or vehicle, in residential areas where rabies is prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The time for prevention is now,’ Gelman said. ‘One ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That’s exactly what we’re trying to accomplish here.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 15:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我给了我的侄女一份慷慨的礼物。现在他们四分五裂，我得到了所有的指责- Slate杂志 | I Gave My Nieces a Generous Gift.

Her sisters were 14 and 12. The idea was the girls would share the car as they got older, or my sister would sell it and split the money between them. She made an agreement with me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o66s000d3b78tknk130q@published"&gt;A few weeks ago at dinner, I heard about the car again, so I told my nieces to drop the subject and said that if they wanted to blame anyone, they should blame their mom. I also said that if Ava was anyone’s favorite it was her.  My sister got very upset with me and we ended up having a loud fight. I left and have skipped family dinners since.&lt;/p&gt;

Our parents were not good people so it has always been my sister and me against the world. Even when her boyfriend abandoned her when she was pregnant with her youngest, I was right by her side. I never had kids of my own so I always focused on my sister’s kids. Right now, that feels like a mistake. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6ns000l3b780xvg9hmn@published"&gt;Everyone needs some time to cool off. You have every right to be frustrated—you were super generous with your nieces, and now that generosity is being thrown back at you. For that reason alone, I would take some time to process your anger before you approach this problem with your sister—and keep the kids out of the conversation. Sure, your sister might be stressed with the transportation logistics, but I’m not sure why the responsibility to solve that problem falls on you. Your sister might just need some time to reflect on the reality of the situation to see how unfair she’s being.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6pw000m3b78rn3qgof2@published"&gt;Be transparent about the fact that you all need some time to cool off. Something like, “I hope you know you’re all my favorite, I love you very much, but I’m really hurt by how this all shaped up, so I’m going to take some space to think about things and I hope we can talk through it later.” Right now, emotions are heavy, so it’s hard to stay calm—which is probably why you’re telling your nieces to blame their mom, which isn’t really helpful, either. Being upfront about needing some space lets your sister and nieces know you’re not the enemy. You’re still there for them, so they don’t have to spiral about what your intentions are and where you’re at with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6rx000n3b785kvmsic4@published"&gt;When you do feel ready to talk through things, that doesn’t mean you have to give into their demands. Give your sister a chance to air her grievances and listen to her, but tell her that ultimately, you simply can’t afford to buy her way out of this problem and you don’t want to talk about it further. She should communicate this to her kids instead of turning them against you. You’ve stated a pretty clear boundary already, so if she can’t stick to it, maybe you both need more time to let this go.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2o6u1000o3b78orpb2dzd@published"&gt;It sounds like you and your sister and nieces have a strong bond, and it would be a shame to let something like this break that bond. Tell her how much they mean to you, and that next time you want to do something generous, you’ll talk through it with her and set some firm ground rules for the gift. Family relationships are messy, but they’re also resilient. Give this one time to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2nhq6001v95m6oru8ums3@published"&gt;I have a stepbrother and half sister. They used to make an effort to include me in their lives and the lives of their children. But when our parents (my dad and step-mom) died a decade ago, that ended. Now, unless I hound them, I don’t get a phone call, let alone an invitation to Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcx000s3b781b7n1dx8@published"&gt;I might as well be invisible to their children unless the check doesn’t clear. I am not talking thank you notes. I am talking how my adult nieces and nephews don’t even have the time of day to text back when I tell them “happy birthday.” So when my I got my nephew’s engagement announcement in the mail, I didn’t bother to acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg363n200223b78gwerza5r@published"&gt;My half sister called me out of the blue and asked why I hadn’t reach out to her son or send a check as a gift. I was blunt and told her I hadn’t talk to her son in three years since he graduated college, and I was tired of our relationship being a one-way street. She claimed her son was just a busy young adult and said thank you notes were out of style. I told her gratitude and graciousness were timeless and it was tacky as all hell to demand money from people for personal events and not even acknowledge their gifts. I asked why she even bothered to call me. We hadn’t spoken to each other in months or seen each other in two years. She claimed I was being petty and our parents are rolling in their graves over my actions. I told her goodbye and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcx000w3b78svraqst1@published"&gt;I thought I was at peace with my choice to stop responding to them, but speaking to my sister left me with my hands shaking. I have no other family beyond my mother who has dementia and is in a care facility. She doesn’t know me half the time. I do have good friends, but they have their own lives and families. My health is good, but I know my time on earth is limited. A big part of me is afraid of what might come. Am I making a mistake here?&lt;/p&gt;

Even if that’s true, it doesn’t mean straight up asking people for money is okay. The point is, your half-sister doesn’t sound very kind, and using your parents as a bargaining tool to emotionally manipulate you is especially gross.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcy00113b789a6goill@published"&gt;If you never hear from your family except when they want cash, that’s not exactly the support system you want in your older years. I understand the concern about being alone, but accepting crumbs of attention only when your family needs something isn’t a real connection. It’s setting yourself up for continued hurt. The fact that your hands were shaking after that call is so telling about how this dynamic affects you. Your body is having a physical reaction to the emotional stress this is causing you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdg2orcy00123b78o2gmj2xn@published"&gt;If you really want to give it one more shot, you could reach out and say something like, “I’d like to have a real relationship with you, but I’m hurt that I only hear from the family when money’s involved.” But someone who calls you demanding gifts for events you weren’t even properly invited to, then tries to guilt you when you say no, probably isn’t going to suddenly become the caring family you deserve. You’re not being petty here. You’re being protective.&lt;/p&gt;

We didn't think much of it. We definitely didn't know it was a symptom of something so serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio shared that his father, a chip shop owner who hails from the English town of Stoke-on-Trent, would smell the “sweet smell” sporadically: “On the odd occasion he would have a caramel smell … it would happen very quickly, and once a month or so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Fantis / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Costa Fantis with his wife Christella.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his father struggled with &lt;a href="https://people.com/parents/lake-bell-update-daughter-nova-epilepsy-exclusive/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:epilepsy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; as a child, Antonio explains that “we told him to have a scan and said it's probably going to be in relation to the epilepsy. We weren't really thinking anything of it at all, as he was a really fit and healthy man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Costa underwent tests in April 2024, the family was given bleak, unexpected news: He had stage 4 IDH-wildtype &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/greg-link-gbm-awareness-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glioblastoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;. “There's no cure for &lt;a href="https://people.com/sports/dangerous-chemicals-found-in-turf-at-old-phillies-stadium-where-6-former-players-developed-b/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glioblastoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;," the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20569077#:~:text=It%20can%20form%20in%20the,can%20happen%20at%20any%20age." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains.

"It's really bizarre because symptoms-wise he didn't have much at all," Antonio told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phantom smells — like what Costa experienced with the caramel scent — is known as phantosmia, and can, rarely, be a sign of &lt;a href="https://braintumor.org/news/my-brain-tumor-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a brain tumor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a brain tumor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Fantis / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Costa Fantis had no symptoms other than smelling phantom odors.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just kind of proves that you can be a fit and healthy man yet still have something wrong with you,” Antonio tells the outlet, sharing that his father has undergone chemotherapy and radiation for the tumor — but is now looking for alternative treatments, as “in the last 20 years the treatments haven't changed for glioblastomas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite a scary thing to be diagnosed with,” Antonio says, sharing his family has been told, “just enjoy your life, in the most harrowing way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/phantom-smells-deadly-condition-dad-caramel-glioblastoma-11777152" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:47:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFB1QzY5RmxZVFhBWlhuU0M2TjBWMUMxb3lVQkJRT3l4TWt0dUx5N0RKNFBvWkVpOGpBYjFweE1KYmhlV0FFeldhLUw2T3hOMmFkOGppaFlxTXVxLVk4UEFsRm82U25wR1ZMZkE</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州患者死于脑吞噬变形虫，医院证实- CBS新闻 | Patient dies of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina, hospital confirms - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPWnZzSXUwLUZ0czFZeDdUdEcyai15eGZhVkdwaXljRnM0UHpLUW5PYTVlX3BRc1dmdmxLNV9BTzh1cFg1SjluNV8wOVB6cDA0VlVJZW1QOGtOQWdVNGx1eUJjUmdLZnYzSG9EWE1NOHZxQURlNEJrTDdfYXNBeC03aWNNRdIBiAFBVV95cUxOMkVsaDRZaGlEQkZhZ2xRaUNkTkxYSnBHeUlnbG1HUHdFd0w2NTdlbkZlYW9hc2d4MllPckVYcXlFWmtrRXV0alg2RzB1cDJpU0xZdEhkbTZGRVhMZ0dkTTk0TVRmSElwYmY4ODg1Y05RUVZiUElhNzEyRzZVTC1TZ3lnTWw5Nk5x?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A patient in a South Carolina children's hospital has died of a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-swimmer-dies-after-infection-caused-by-brain-eating-amoeba/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to the facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a news briefing Tuesday, Prisma Health Children's Hospital-Midlands confirmed the patient died of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM, a rare but often fatal brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital did not share any more details about the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, the patient's exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, though officials said they cannot be completely certain. The department said this is the first known case in the state since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the briefing, Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the hospital, said these infections are "very devastating," with the vast majority of cases in the United States ending in death. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greater than 97% of cases that have occurred since the '60s have been fatal," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burch explained the infections occur when forceful water gets up the nose and is able to cross into the brain. This can happen during &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;recreational water activities&lt;/a&gt; in warm freshwater &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-swimmer-dies-after-infection-caused-by-brain-eating-amoeba/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rivers and hot springs, where the amoeba thrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce your risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests holding your nose or wearing a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into freshwater or keeping your head above water in hot springs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing contaminated water or from someone else who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first death caused by Naegleria fowleri in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-woman-dies-brain-eating-amoeba-tap-water-sinus-rinse/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;A Texas woman died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from an infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba after using tap water from her RV in a nasal irrigation device, health officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previously healthy 71-year-old developed severe symptoms, including fever, headache and altered mental status, within four days after the nasal irrigation rinse, the CDC case report said.
