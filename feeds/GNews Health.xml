    &lt;p&gt;Health officials are working to alert hundreds of people in dozens of states and several countries who may have been exposed to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-dies-bat-bite-extremely-rare-infection-australia/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;rabies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in bat-infested cabins in Wyoming's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wyoming-governor-sale-of-state-land-grand-teton-national-park/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, none of the bats found in some of the eight linked cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge had tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the handful of dead bats found and sent to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie for testing were probably only a small sample of the likely dozens that colonized the attic above the row of cabins, Wyoming State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bats weren't killed but got shooed out through the cabin doors and windows. Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabins have been unoccupied, with no plans to reopen, since concessionaire Grand Teton Lodge Company discovered the bat problem on July 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur — muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few — rabies is almost always fatal in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that a five-shot prophylactic regimen over two weeks soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were trying to reach people in 38 states and seven countries through those states' health agencies and, in the case of foreign visitors, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others who have not been alerted yet but stayed in cabins 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530 this year should tell health officials or a doctor immediately, Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials were recommending prophylactic shots for people who fit certain criteria, such as deep sleepers who found a bat in their room, and children too young to say that they had seen a bat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wyoming Department of Health had no ongoing concern about visitor safety at the Jackson Lake Lodge area. That includes a Federal Reserve economic policy symposium Aug. 21-23 that takes place at Jackson Lake Lodge every summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lodge company has done a fantastic job of doing their due diligence of making sure everyone that is coming in for that, and for all other visits this year, are going to be as safe as possible," said Emily Curren, Wyoming's public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three or four" dead bats from the cabins tested negative and one that was mangled did not have enough brain tissue to be testable, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All were brown bats, which come in two species: "little" and "big," with the larger ones more than twice as big. Officials were unsure which species these were, but both are common in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They typically live in colonies of 30 to 100 individuals, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a lot of bats that we cannot rule out a risk of rabies being in," Curren said. "There's no way for us to know for certain about every single bat that got into these rooms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no plans to exterminate the bats, Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis said. Devices fitted to the building were keeping the bats from getting back in after flying out in pursuit of insects to eat, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists are uncovering that ADHD influences far more than attention and behavior alone. From sexual experiences and creativity to brain structure and even life expectancy, new findings are offering a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what it means to live with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity—symptoms that can disrupt daily life at school, work, and in social relationships. While it typically begins in childhood, a substantial number of cases persist into adolescence and adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is generally classified into three presentations: predominantly inattentive (formerly called ADD), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. People with ADHD may find it challenging to sustain focus, manage time, resist distractions, or regulate impulses. Although stimulant medications such as methylphenidate remain a mainstay of treatment, researchers are increasingly investigating non-pharmacological approaches, underlying biological mechanisms, and the broader social and emotional dimensions of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on for 12 recent studies that highlight the surprising range of ADHD’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found that young adults who screen positive for ADHD tend to listen to background music more frequently than their neurotypical peers—especially while studying or exercising. These individuals also prefer more stimulating music, regardless of the activity. This suggests that music may be used as a form of self-regulation, potentially helping to counteract underarousal associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, based on survey data from over 400 participants, supports the Moderate Brain Arousal model, which posits that people with ADHD often seek external stimulation to maintain focus. Although both ADHD and non-ADHD groups reported that music helped their mood and concentration, only the ADHD group showed significantly higher usage during daily tasks. The researchers note that music could serve as an accessible and intuitive tool to help individuals with ADHD manage attentional demands in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Sex Research&lt;/em&gt;, scientists found that women with predominantly inattentive ADHD symptoms reported lower orgasmic consistency during partnered sex. This may be linked to difficulties maintaining focus and being present during sexual activity—a challenge that inattentive ADHD can exacerbate. In contrast, women with hyperactive-impulsive symptoms reported slightly better orgasmic consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from over 800 cisgender women, researchers noted that sexual satisfaction and confidence can be shaped by cognitive and attentional processes. ADHD medications appeared to correlate with better sexual functioning, although the study could not determine causation. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness of how neurodivergence may influence intimate experiences, particularly in women who are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroimaging study in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt; compared adults with ADHD who had taken psychostimulants to those who had never received such treatment. Those with a history of medication use showed greater brain surface complexity—specifically, increased cortical folding (gyrification) and sulcal depth in regions involved in emotion regulation and reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these structural differences were not accompanied by better clinical outcomes. Symptom severity and impulsivity scores remained similar across both groups. This suggests that while stimulants may influence brain morphology, these changes do not necessarily translate into improved functioning. The study’s small sample size limits generalizability, but the findings raise important questions about how long-term medication affects the adult ADHD brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized controlled trial published in &lt;em&gt;Research on Child and Adolescent Psychopathology&lt;/em&gt; tested whether probiotics could reduce ADHD and autism symptoms. The researchers found that a 12-week course of two probiotic strains was linked to lower hyperactivity-impulsivity ratings in children aged 5 to 9. The effect was especially pronounced in children with autism who also had ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While overall symptom improvement across all age groups was modest, younger children in the probiotic group showed meaningful behavioral gains. These early findings support growing interest in the gut-brain axis and suggest that microbiome-targeted interventions might offer complementary support for children with neurodevelopmental differences. Larger, longer studies are needed to confirm the durability and mechanisms of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychiatric Research&lt;/em&gt;, researchers in Sweden found that teenage boys with ADHD tended to underreport their symptoms compared to parent and clinician assessments. In contrast, girls’ self-ratings were more consistent with external evaluations. Overall, adolescent self-reports aligned more closely with clinicians than with parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that boys may have less insight into their symptoms—or may be less willing to report them—while girls may be more self-aware or forthcoming. The results point to the importance of incorporating multiple informants during the diagnostic process and ensuring that adolescent voices are considered, especially when sex differences may influence symptom expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science&lt;/em&gt; challenged the common belief that autism is linked to heightened creativity. After controlling for ADHD and cognitive ability, researchers found that autistic adults were no more creative than non-autistic adults in laboratory tasks. However, those with co-occurring ADHD showed more creative accomplishments and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that creativity may be more closely tied to ADHD traits—such as impulsivity and flexible thinking—than to autism itself. This challenges stereotypes about “autistic creativity” and indicates that educational and clinical programs should tailor support to the individual’s unique cognitive profile, rather than assuming strengths based on diagnosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers identified amlodipine—a common medication for high blood pressure—as a potential treatment for ADHD. Using animal models and genetic analyses, they found that amlodipine reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity in rats and zebrafish bred to mimic ADHD-like traits. The drug also appeared to influence brain activity in areas associated with attention and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these findings notable is that amlodipine targets L-type calcium channels, which are increasingly implicated in psychiatric conditions. The research team confirmed that the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier and proposed that its mechanism could provide a safer, non-stimulant alternative to traditional ADHD medications. Clinical trials in humans are still needed, but this repurposing strategy could offer new treatment avenues for individuals who do not respond well to current medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A population-level study from Denmark, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychiatric Research&lt;/em&gt;, tracked nearly 5,000 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and found that by age 30, they fared significantly worse than their peers in education, employment, and mental health. Despite many participants adhering to prescribed medication over a 10-year period, outcomes like job attainment and higher education completion did not improve meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with ADHD were more likely to live alone, rely on social welfare, and have co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Medication adherence did not predict better educational or occupational outcomes, suggesting that pharmacological treatment alone may not be sufficient to address the broader life challenges associated with ADHD. Socioeconomic factors, such as parental education, were more predictive of success, highlighting the importance of comprehensive, multi-level interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroimaging study published in &lt;em&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/em&gt; examined how adults with ADHD process risky decisions before making them. Participants completed a task involving risk and reward (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) while undergoing fMRI scans. The researchers found that individuals with ADHD showed reduced activation in brain regions linked to self-awareness and emotional processing during the anticipation phase—before the decision was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, women with ADHD showed greater activation in several regulatory brain regions compared to men, suggesting possible sex-related differences in compensatory mechanisms. These neural differences did not translate into overt behavioral differences on the task, indicating that people with ADHD may reach the same decisions as others but through different internal processes. The study offers support for theories like the somatic marker hypothesis, which emphasizes the role of bodily cues and emotional signals in guiding decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large cohort study from the United Kingdom, published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, found that adults diagnosed with ADHD have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those without the condition. On average, men with ADHD lost between 4.5 and 9 years of life, while women lost between 6.5 and 11 years. These figures are adjusted for baseline health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attribute this gap to a combination of factors: higher rates of physical and mental health issues, greater risk of substance use, and social disadvantages like unemployment and limited access to healthcare. ADHD itself may not directly shorten lifespan, but its effects can compound over time through preventable pathways. These findings point to the need for systemic changes in healthcare access and public health interventions tailored to people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals who report symptoms of ADHD tend to experience more frequent involuntary memories in daily life. These spontaneous recollections, which arise without intention, were also rated as less positive and more repetitive compared to those reported by people without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted both a lab-based vigilance task and a 48-hour diary study. While the laboratory task showed no difference between groups, the diary data revealed that people with ADHD symptoms reported nearly twice as many spontaneous memories. This suggests that controlled lab settings may fail to capture the full extent of attentional and memory-related differences experienced in everyday life. These findings may shed light on how ADHD affects not just attention, but also memory and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large-scale genetic study published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, researchers found that ADHD and dyslexia share a substantial number of genetic risk factors. Using data from millions of participants, the study identified a distinct genetic cluster linking both conditions and uncovered 49 genomic regions associated with both traits—43 of which had not been previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shared “attention and learning difficulties” factor was distinct from other neurodevelopmental traits like autism. The findings suggest that ADHD may have more in common genetically with dyslexia than with autism, despite all three conditions commonly co-occurring. Several genes identified in the analysis—such as SORCS3 and AMT—are involved in brain development, learning, and memory. These results offer new insight into the biological basis of learning and attention problems and could guide future research on personalized educational and therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 12:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOdjBZMzl3cXVhRG1LeGJXcWFwbGUwdHM5empPUWlYMW9LZ0tWamdzWDBla1lOc3d5YmZMNHo3QWhoWk9YWGt4YWNFblRTWGQ0NlpiZFhvbGI1Z3p4TFZTNHNrTmJmTHQ4dG5CVkhTVHRhbnljeldRT1RadG8tOWZ1ZUd5UnpkOW9aUVhsSThjMmtpNUVoZk5adVR3</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了患早期痴呆症的最大风险因素- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNTU9Yak1KOThQRm4tUU9mWkhraGRmNEdLZDNSejJqYmY2NlFrTExRQmRyY2tDeUJfUHZQRDJOVWVkN1U1X1phRFlkUjJOZHd1S29vSVJRZDRoRDJTSWVsQWZEakl2T2JGRjhLUFVvYVdjUGRnZnRodTl0ZWQ5S3gtU2dmQ2dXcDVIaW5qM2xnQ0ZGSzZHMmlhYmEySTVrWkN1MkNKeXJ1TklEcDBFVFlnNkQxaWZuZmtqWVVzRFFrWDFSX2lMTkI00gHMAUFVX3lxTFBtNi1MdnMtQm1yb0FBWDZxZnVsRkdlYTlkY2NZSFlfTFlQSDFxYTl0VkNyZ2c5Z25nZ3VoTFUwWDBUaEJqVzBlaW9PdGxkSkhnZlVDcnBCV0hrd3FvWFp6cnlBN3VoejBfZmk0WUhWSmMwMnBnejFEWHdudm1QTXJHc0U3RUJMdTd0a2ZySWFJbjJVU293REVQS2FSYnpsR3o0M1lraDFURDR6RHd4bDRJSktTaGpxMGlkS0tKRDhwMTY2dWlQS1VqSzZEcA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study by the University of Exeter and Maastricht University published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2813439?guestAccessKey=c06f6a02-37d0-45ab-95b6-e44e9f585c51" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="JAMA Neurology" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1d2fe4b048e97f076d0f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2813439?guestAccessKey=c06f6a02-37d0-45ab-95b6-e44e9f585c51" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt; has identified some of the factors that can lead to early cases of dementia ― some of which may surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data analyzed the behaviors of over 350,000 participants younger than 65 across the United Kingdom to evaluate young-onset dementia, which occurs before age 65.

Basically, anything that engages your mind will help it stay healthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mood stimulation, on the other hand, relates to stress reduction practices, “such as mindfulness and yoga,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for social stimulation, it’s pretty simple: Try to connect with other humans face-to-face and actually talk to them as much as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the era of pandemic and now post-pandemic, quality social connections should increasingly be encouraged and practiced,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

That’s nearly half the adult population either living with diabetes or on the brink of developing it. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, is largely linked to lifestyle factors such as diet, physical inactivity, and excess weight. Left unmanaged, it can lead to serious complications, heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss, placing a huge burden on both individuals and the healthcare system. Take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="24423200" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="diabetes-reversal" source="keywords"&gt;Diabetes reversal&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/10-magnesium-rich-foods-for-those-with-diabetes/photostory/123307016.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;diabetes &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;reversal is gaining attention because it offers hope beyond medication. By addressing the root causes, insulin resistance, high blood sugar, and metabolic imbalance, many people can bring their blood glucose back to normal levels and maintain it without reliance on drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes like a nutrient-rich diet, regular exercise, weight management, and stress reduction have been shown to restore insulin sensitivity and protect long-term health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversal not only reduces the risk of complications but also improves energy, mood, and quality of life. Given the scale of the problem in the US, prioritizing prevention and reversal could significantly improve public health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, diabetes dietitians Diana Licalzi &amp;amp; Jose Tejero, shared on their &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKItlsFv_Ho/?igsh=MW83bHFxbm1wNmZvZQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;account about four foods that can help with diabetes reversal. The duo offers tips to lower blood sugar to non-diabetic levels with guides and meal plans. "We have the power to stop the progression of diabetes with the food we eat. When you start focusing on health promoting foods, you’ll see you number come down," they have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert has listed the following four foods that can help with lowering high blood sugar levels: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beans:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expert stresses on eating black beans to control diabetes. Beans are like nature’s slow-burn energy pack. Packed with fiber and plant protein, they help keep your blood sugar from spiking after meals. That fiber slows digestion, meaning glucose drips into your bloodstream nice and steady instead of flooding it. Plus, beans are rich in magnesium, which helps your cells respond better to insulin—kind of like oiling the hinges so the doors open smoothly for sugar to get inside. Black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas—mix them into soups, salads, or burrito bowls, and you’re not just eating tasty comfort food, you’re helping your body manage blood sugar like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broccoli: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli isn’t just a dinner side, it’s a diabetes-fighting powerhouse. It’s loaded with sulforaphane, a compound that can improve insulin sensitivity and protect blood vessels from damage caused by high sugar levels. Plus, broccoli naturally contains chromium, a mineral that plays a key role in improving how your body uses insulin. That means it can help lower blood sugar over time. The fiber content is top notch for slowing down those pesky glucose spikes, and since it’s super low in carbs, it won’t mess with your balance. Steamed, roasted, or tossed in a stir-fry, broccoli is your crunchy green ally in reversing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Edamame:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edamame, those little green soybeans you snack on at sushi restaurants, are secretly a blood sugar superhero. They’re packed with plant protein, fiber, and isoflavones that help improve insulin sensitivity. Because they’re low on the glycemic index, they don’t cause sharp sugar spikes, keeping your energy levels more even. Bonus: that protein-fiber combo keeps you fuller longer, so you’re less tempted to reach for sugary snacks. Boil them, sprinkle with a little sea salt, or toss into salads for a satisfying crunch. Edamame is proof that small, simple snacks can pack a big punch in supporting diabetes management and even reversing its course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Berries: &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries are like candy nature actually approves of. They’re sweet but low in sugar, high in fiber, and full of antioxidants that help improve insulin function. The anthocyanins (that’s the plant pigment giving them their bold colors) are linked to better glucose control and reduced inflammation. Eating berries with meals can even slow carb digestion, which means fewer blood sugar rollercoasters. Whether you toss them into yogurt, blend into smoothies, or snack on them fresh, berries give you a guilt-free sweet fix while working behind the scenes to support your body’s efforts in reversing diabetes and keeping insulin on point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with these four foods, experts also recommend some other foods that can help lower blood sugar levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seafoods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seafood, including fish and shellfish, is a rich source of protein, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may help regulate blood sugar levels. Protein plays a key role in blood sugar management by slowing digestion, preventing post-meal spikes, and promoting a feeling of fullness. This can help reduce overeating and support healthy weight loss, both important for maintaining stable blood sugar. Additionally, regularly consuming fatty fish like salmon and sardines has been shown to improve blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pumpkin and pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin and its seeds are brightly colored, rich in fiber, and loaded with antioxidants, making them a smart choice for supporting healthy blood sugar levels. In countries like Mexico and Iran, pumpkin has long been used as a traditional remedy for diabetes. It contains polysaccharides, a type of carbohydrate, that have shown potential in regulating blood sugar. Studies using pumpkin extracts and powders have found significant reductions in blood sugar levels in both limited human trials and animal research. However, more studies are needed to confirm the effects of consuming whole pumpkin on blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing type 2 diabetes isn’t magic. It’s often about what’s on your plate. A balanced, nutrient-rich diet can help lower blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, and even reduce the need for medication. Think less processed junk and more whole foods, veggies, lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-packed carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back on added sugars and refined grains helps your body avoid those nasty glucose spikes. Some people see dramatic improvements just by swapping soda for water, adding more greens, and controlling portions. Pair it with regular movement, and your body gets the tools it needs to heal and balance blood sugar naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But remember, lasting change comes from consistency, not quick fixes. Focus on gradual improvements you can stick with—meal planning, mindful eating, and finding physical activities you enjoy. Regular check-ins with your doctor or a registered dietitian can help track progress and adjust your plan safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dislcaimer: This content is provided for general informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;With ChatGPT's constant evolution and advancement as a tool, many have started relying excessively on it, not just for streamlining their tasks and everyday life but also for deeply personal matters. We have heard some &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/after-12-years-of-marriage-woman-files-for-divorce-after-chatgpt-claims-her-husbands-infidelity-through-coffee-grounds-interpretation/"&gt;bizarre cases&lt;/a&gt; of marriages ending due to the tool tracing evidence of infidelity, and even people &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-issues-chilling-warning-chatgpt-is-not-a-therapist-your-deepest-secrets-could-be-used-against-you-in-court-with-no-legal-protection/"&gt;relying &lt;/a&gt;on the chatbot for therapy, which Sam Altman has warned against. Now, a troubling case has come forward where the risk of relying on the AI assistant for health guidance has arisen. A 60-year-old man in New York is said to have developed a rare and dangerous condition after following the dietary advice laid out by the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-dangers-of-ai-health-tips-bromism-and-the-salt-alternative-that-went-too-far"&gt;The hidden dangers of AI health tips: Bromism and the salt alternative that went too far&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we have been hearing about not relying on any AI model excessively from time to time, a recent warning comes from the U.S. medical journal against seeking medical advice from ChatGPT after a man fell seriously ill following dietary advice from the chatbot, as highlighted by&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/man-asked-chatgpt-cutting-salt-diet-was-hospitalized-hallucinations-rcna225055"&gt; NBC&lt;/a&gt; News. The case has been published in the&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where an extensive report about a 60-year-old man who developed bromism, also known as bromide poisoning, after acting on the guidance of the AI assistant has been published.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The poor man developed the rare and dangerous condition after he replaced common table salt (sodium chloride) with sodium bromide, a substance he obtained online. ChatGPT gave advice when he inquired about a potential substitute for salt. The man consumed the sodium bromide daily for three months, believing it to be a healthier alternative. The outcome of this, however, was devastating as he developed paranoia, insomnia, psychosis, and other severe physical symptoms, making him think at one point in time that he was being poisoned by one of his neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man ended up being hospitalized, where the doctors diagnosed bromism, which is the toxic reaction to excessive bromide exposure. After he stopped consuming bromide and received the necessary treatment, his symptoms began to resolve. While the condition is hardly seen these days due to the rare availability of bromide salts, the case does serve as a reminder against substances like these that can be purchased online without much oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient’s story also raises alarm about how AI should be used with caution, especially in health contexts. The researchers even looked into whether or not ChatGPT was giving such responses, and it was, in fact, suggesting bromide as an alternative to chloride. No warning of toxicity was given, making the responses even more concerning. Chatbots cannot be medical professionals and offer the same judgment and responsibility, and thus, they should not be taken as experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, AI models should come with better safety guardrails, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. We live in an age of AI tools; thus, curiosity should not overlap with caution and should never outweigh professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Studies are also looking into how the gut biome &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" target="_self"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to keep your gut healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to determine the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut and overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cresci also said that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;foods with a lot of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber should be removed from your gut or eaten in lower amounts. "These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_self"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_self"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the pH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has its own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking them for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too. So, if we eat when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to process the nutrients of our food properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 07:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVWxmSkcya1hlSnAweFZwQ2JUZ2VtSEZqZnpKQVpfckVoVkNfYWIyWDY0VzhUMHlsM1RvSjRJNTIwRWZkbUpDRms4OUMtbFNHcy1ramowWkkzRVA2Y0o4NjVheHE5WHExNzFycGRFVmhDUUlNQ3JVSHhhRGhEM0NJTjRNeEZvc1FScTdQRmQ0WXBIUGttcnc0end2XzNoQVEzb1lWa21FY3VVRWVVdUJSZXFsZGVpWkxyT2c</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏协会的新血压指南：关键要点-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;Fatty liver disease: Warning signs one s...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;5 human body parts we may no longer need...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 06:24:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>通过这三种核心稳定机芯--Fit&amp;Well--建立更好的平衡</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQM2twRVNleTVnRlp2WnE4TnN4MFFHWUNNYm9jYldlckFNcTg0bExzQkhqQ3EwelVOSXE4WlhNcFh3YXM2ZU9WeUdQNC1EbjRZUUxFZkZNdjBrVlpqcERONmRLbnY0SDJBQjk1c2t1bFlQNTZwSk1yX19INzJHdWJCN1pLWDBUMXp2Sy1FeTg3ZWJyZEhhZEd2dnhGY0NrQTVpd2dlX0V6cFQ0X2gwbHZuNDBlUkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p id="dc1e2997-a168-4d53-8a7f-c39d80fd6b51"&gt;Good core stability is important for everyday movements.

It is among the most common cancers in the UK and globally, impacting thousands of lives each year. While digestive symptoms like changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, bloating, and unexplained weight loss are well known, colon cancer can also cause symptoms on the skin, though these are relatively rare. Skin signs such as nodules, rashes, ulcers, or noticeable changes in pigmentation may indicate the cancer has spread, is progressing, or has reached advanced stages. Recognising these unusual skin symptoms early can be crucial for timely diagnosis, medical intervention, and effective treatment, significantly improving outcomes and survival rates for those affected by this serious disease.

These lesions can vary in colour, often reddish, purple, or skin-toned, and may appear anywhere but are frequently found on the abdomen, chest, or around surgical scars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2.

This can be due to paraneoplastic syndromes, where the immune system reacts abnormally to the presence of cancer. These skin changes may appear before other symptoms, signaling underlying malignancy, and should prompt timely evaluation, especially when accompanied by unexplained weight loss or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3.

These can become sites of secondary infection, causing pain, discomfort, swelling, foul odor, and increased risk of systemic infection, necessitating prompt medical evaluation and appropriate wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4.

These skin alterations may indicate underlying vascular, autoimmune, or systemic issues requiring medical evaluation for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do skin symptoms occur&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metastasis: Colon cancer cells travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system and settle in the skin, forming secondary tumours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immune response: The body’s reaction to the cancer can produce paraneoplastic skin conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment effects: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause skin dryness, rashes, and sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694720/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, cutaneous metastases from colon cancer occur in approximately 3-6% of patients, indicating a poor prognosis but providing important clinical clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice unusual skin changes such as persistent lumps, sores that don’t heal, or unexplained rashes, especially if you have a history of colon cancer or related symptoms (e.g., changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss), it is essential to consult a healthcare professional promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50c0eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6cb696" class="body-graf"&gt;“What we’re really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat,” Harrist said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd4d1e" class="body-graf"&gt;The cabins have been unoccupied, with no plans to reopen, since concessionaire Grand Teton Lodge Company discovered the bat problem July 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e8741" class="body-graf"&gt;Bats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur — muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few — rabies is almost always fatal in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35dbf" class="body-graf"&gt;The good news is a five-shot prophylactic regimen over a two-week period soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9af68e" class="body-graf"&gt;The cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b32043" class="body-graf"&gt;They were trying to reach people in 38 states and seven countries through those states’ health agencies and, in the case of foreign visitors, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04aeec" class="body-graf"&gt;Others who have not been alerted yet but stayed in cabins 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530 this year should tell health officials or a doctor immediately, Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e4724" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials were recommending prophylactic shots for people who fit certain criteria, such as deep sleepers who found a bat in their room, and children too young to say that they had seen a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c0449" class="body-graf"&gt;The Wyoming Department of Health had no ongoing concern about visitor safety at the Jackson Lake Lodge area. That includes a Federal Reserve economic policy symposium Aug. 21-23 that takes place at Jackson Lake Lodge every summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4346b7" class="body-graf"&gt;“The lodge company has done a fantastic job of doing their due diligence of making sure everyone that is coming in for that, and for all other visits this year, are going to be as safe as possible,” said Emily Curren, Wyoming’s public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-940b4b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Three or four” dead bats from the cabins tested negative and one that was mangled did not have enough brain tissue to be testable, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-921e9e" class="body-graf"&gt;All were brown bats, which come in two species: “little” and “big,” with the larger ones more than twice as big. Officials were unsure which species these were, but both are common in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ad8b5" class="body-graf"&gt;They typically live in colonies of 30 to 100 individuals, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9b24d" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a lot of bats that we cannot rule out a risk of rabies being in,” Curren said. “There’s no way for us to know for certain about every single bat that got into these rooms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3be319" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;There are no plans to exterminate the bats, Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis said.

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — So far this year, at least three infant deaths associated with &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/syphilis-in-newborns-why-is-it-happening/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/syphilis-in-newborns-why-is-it-happening/"&gt;congenital syphilis&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in New York state, as the number of reported cases continues to increase nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 12, the New York State &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-08-12_testing_for_syphilis.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-08-12_testing_for_syphilis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; issued a release urging parents to get tested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No baby should die from syphilis in New York State or anywhere in this country; it is completely preventable,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is congenital syphilis?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection that can result in serious health complications when left untreated, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The infection develops in stages and can be spread through contact with a syphilis sore during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can also be transmitted through casual contact with everyday objects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs when syphilis is passed from a person infected with syphilis to their child during pregnancy or birth, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Congenital syphilis can result in miscarriage, stillbirth and death shortly after birth. If the baby survives, they may also be premature and develop serious health issues, including deformed bones, severe anemia and brain and nerve problems, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Not all parents with syphilis will pass it on to their offspring, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/congenital-syphilis" data-type="link" data-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/congenital-syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is it treatable?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is imperative to treat congenital syphilis immediately upon diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment of congenital syphilis can occur while the parent is pregnant or right after birth with penicillin. However, a nationwide penicillin shortage is contributing to concern related to the rising numbers, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/from-the-director/2025-07-bicillin-recall.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/from-the-director/2025-07-bicillin-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“Detecting syphilis early in pregnancy with a simple blood test is important to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment, so you have a healthy baby,” McDonald said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of May 2024, New York state requires that all pregnant people undergo a syphilis test at least three times during pregnancy, including at the time of first examination, during the third trimester and at delivery, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A growing problem nationally&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were 209,253 cases of syphilis nationwide, the highest total since 1950, per &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During a recent 10-year stretch, the number of congenital syphilis cases shot up over 1,000%, from 334 cases reported in 2012 to 3,761 in 2022, per &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;

"In fact, many patients return for follow-up visits post-mango season, often with elevated glucose levels, and sometimes, the culprit may just be overindulgence in this beloved fruit," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This constant dilemma has left many people with diabetes wary of the "king of fruits". Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). It's the eighth leading cause of disease burden worldwide, projected to rank second by 2050. Though not fully understood, it's strongly linked to excess weight, age, ethnicity and family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In India, an estimated 77 million adults have type 2 diabetes, while nearly 25 million are prediabetic and at high risk of developing the condition, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/india/diabetes" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hindustan Times via Getty Images People look at mangoes during a festival of mangoes with different varieties of fruits on a table in India." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Hindustan Times via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Mango festivals pop up across Indian cities, celebrating the fruit's cultural significance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet amidst the challenges, new findings offer a surprising ray of hope - especially for mango lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A pilot study soon to appear in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition and involving 95 participants found that three popular Indian mango varities - Safeda, Dasheri and Langra - produced similar or lower glycemic responses than white bread over two hours of glucose testing. (A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango. This low fluctuation glycemic response could be beneficial to the body in the long run, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Mangoes are a much-loved fruit and maligned for its possible glucose and weight-elevating effects," said Dr Sugandha Kehar, first author of both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These studies show that within prescribed diets, consumption of mangoes are not detrimental to blood glucose and may even be beneficial,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A second, eight-week randomised trial published in the Journal of Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Disorders - conducted at Delhi's Fortis C-DOC with Indian Council of Medical Research funding - has reinforced the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thirty-five adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C test (HbA1c) which measures average blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference and HDL cholesterol. These markers are key indicators of diabetes control and overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We showed the benefits of small doses of mangoes in place of carbohydrates (bread) in breakfast in two detailed studies for the first time, laying to rest all speculations regarding adverse metabolic effects of its consumption," says Prof Anoop Misra, senior author and study lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But the key is moderation and clinical supervision - this is not a licence for unlimited mango feasts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Bloomberg via Getty Images A health worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient while during a free door-to-door screening programme." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;An estimated 77 million adults in India have type 2 diabetes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked Prof Misra what eating mangoes in moderation meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If your daily limit is 1,600 calories, any calories from mango should be part of that total, not extra.

Pair them with protein or fibre, and avoid combining with other carbs or sugary forms, such as juices and milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Beyond its metabolic impact, the mango occupies a far larger place in Indian life - a fruit that opens doors both literally and figuratively, carrying cultural, social and even diplomatic significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Mango diplomacy" is a familiar phrase across the subcontinent, where carefully chosen crates of the fruit can grease political deals, strengthen alliances or smooth over tense negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images  Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen (L) hands a basket of Indian mangoes to US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns at a ceremony celebrating the opening of mango trade between the United States and India at the Commerce Department in Washington 01 May 2007.

The fruit is, at once, a favourite indulgence and a quietly powerful social currency. "Most Indians have a personal favourite mango and parochial regional loyalties have long fuelled heated ranking debates," says Pushpesh Pant, a Delhi-based historian and culinary expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Good mangoes are not just to be eaten; they are adornments like jewellery. The rules of the mango push the best produce towards those willing to pay the highest price," writes Sopan Joshi in Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, a magisterial account of the fruit and its admirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are more than 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India. Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering. Poet Ghalib called the mango a "a sealed glass of honey", and hundreds of books have been written celebrating its allure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Part indulgence, part icon, the mango continues to delight and inspire - now with a surprising nod from science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 00:28:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9xTldBemF1bnRsTG1TeU9ibmsyNGFJWEZZSEh4NHZ2eWRBQ3M1NXJpNEFFV1JrRmNNN0FJMndzNG5ZSnIxNUFobmF2Ym0tdWZJRWhlSFc2SnVTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE9iQV9BZVc1N3JTMnF3LV9mSXBtM0NmMy1ralF3c2Zsa0IwMzBmRnV2cWJxYjJpWExuRkpQZ0dCZVRkLV96S1p3QW85azRBa2MyTFlieGF6b0wtOWpLRExJ</guid></item><item><title>整个加利福尼亚州的山谷热正在上升。旧金山纪事报（ San Francisco Chronicle ）的一个沿海县的人数正在飙升</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOcm1vZzdfNF9lcGVZNjlGNDJESGtwQ1dfV1BJZm4xUUN1cFZ3TDJxOVFnUGFZRV8xUjhITVRVUHNmaG94UVJQcE9PZmJWLURDTFNua1FtYXdJOU0xTk9sQ2d4RGlKQUIzSEhTQ1VfY0Zkc2ZCdHBpYU55bklaam5Lb2N0SUxUQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmlands in Contra Costa County in August 2023.

That’s an increase of over 260% compared with the 2023-24 average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ventura County had the next highest increase, 92%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California recorded nearly &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/valley-fever-california-20300926.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;12,500 cases&lt;/a&gt; of valley fever in 2024, its most in a single year. By comparison, the state logged 7,000 to 9,000 cases per year from 2017 through 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can occur any time of year, but infections typically happen in late summer and fall. The disease is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which grows in the soil in parts of California. Wet winters help the fungus grow while dry, windy weather during warmer months helps airborne spread of spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in areas with high rates of valley fever face higher risk of infection, especially if they live or work near where dirt is stirred up, like farms and construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where valley fever is common, experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverPrevention.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; people stay inside and keep windows and doors closed when it’s windy and dusty outside. They also suggest drivers keep car windows closed and use recirculating air, if possible. Experts recommend that those who have to be outside in dusty air consider using a well-fitted N95 respirator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone who gets valley fever experiences symptoms. But some people can deal with long-term coughing, fatigue and other flu-like symptoms. In rare cases, valley fever can cause severe lung infections and become fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/valley-fever-lightning-in-a-bottle-19739867.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;at least 19 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of valley fever after a music festival in Kern County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all California counties, Kern County has logged the highest number of cases of valley fever so far in 2025, with 1,945 provisional cases reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 100 cases of valley fever have been provisionally reported in Contra Costa County in 2025, through the end of July.

	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Colorado health officials are warning Mesa County residents of potential measles exposure after an unvaccinated county resident contracted the disease, apparently from within the community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new measles patient had not traveled outside the state or reported any other exposures to previously reported measles cases around Colorado, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a news release Friday afternoon. “The lack of a clear source of infection suggests that this case may be the result of community transmission in the Grand Junction area,” the state said, adding that Mesa County Public Health is investigating further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adult patient had not received the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new case brings to 20 the number of measles cases statewide in 2025, with 13 of those cases coming in patients who were not vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Six of the cases came in patients who had previously received two or more doses of MMR vaccine, and one case was a breakthrough after one dose. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new Grand Junction patient traveled around town a great deal while potentially contagious, the state release said, and officials included a chart showing where and when others might have come in contact, from Aug. 7 through 14. The locations range from Grand Junction Community Hospital to Landmark Baptist Church, to a Chik-fil-A and a Burger King. Area residents who might have been at those locations during those times should limit their contact with others for about 21 days to make sure they do not come down with their own symptoms. Measles is highly contagious, and the vaccines are highly effective. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Residents who are concerned about contact should watch out for symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, “followed by a rash that usually starts several days later on the face and spreads.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who were exposed can still benefit from getting an MMR vaccine within 72 hours of the exposure. If other Mesa County residents do develop symptoms, state officials ask that patients not go unannounced to urgent care or an ER. They should call their medical provider to learn of their preferred arrangement to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;

COVID has proven to be anything but predictable over the last five-plus years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing to know is that a September peak is a best guess based on current trends, but we can’t know for sure how big or long-lasting the current upswing in cases will be until we are on the other side of it,” Dowd told HuffPost via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID levels are lower than last summer, thankfully, according to wastewater data and hospitalization levels, “but, back-to-school could pour fuel on the fire of any viral spread, so we’ll get a better picture in the next few weeks,” Dowd added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models that are used to predict COVID peaks are an imperfect tool, but still contain valuable information, added &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicamalatyrivera/?hl=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jessica Malaty Rivera" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/jessicamalatyrivera/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Jessica Malaty Rivera&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we look at the past, we’ve always had a summer wave [and] we’ve always also had a back-to-school flu season wave. So it’s no surprise that they’re cross-referencing both the historical incidence of COVID and what we’re seeing in wastewater to say it’s pretty likely that this many people probably have COVID right now, or may likely get COVID right now, because this many people are shedding the virus,” added Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Malaty Rivera said that wastewater data is only accurate to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t always say that the presence of virus [in wastewater] is infectious virus,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data can’t distinguish between active virus and non-infectious virus fragments from someone who was infected months ago, Malaty Rivera explained. (Just like how, early in the COVID pandemic, PCR tests could come back &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417974/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="positive for months" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417974/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;positive for months&lt;/a&gt; after someone recovered from a COVID-19 infection, she noted).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so the presence of COVID-19 [in wastewater] is not necessarily the presence of active virus. It could be a virus from people who were sick weeks ago or months ago who are still shedding virus, but it’s not an infectious virus,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in a COVID surge right now and we should expect another bump as kids head back to school in September and as folks return from summer vacations, said Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fall, back to school, return from vacation, has always historically shown an uptick in respiratory illnesses, and COVID is not exclusive to that. COVID is now part of our annual cadence,” she said. “And so the summer surge is no surprise, and to expect another bump is also completely based on evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;We're currently in a summer COVID wave, and some experts say COVID infections could peak in early September.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick during the summer COVID wave, here’s what you should do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get infected with COVID, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the CDC’s recommendations say" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;the CDC’s recommendations say&lt;/a&gt; you should stay home when you’re sick and isolate from other people in your home. The CDC guidance goes on to say you can exit isolation once you’re fever-free and your symptoms are improving or resolving for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can return to your daily life, but should take additional steps to protect others, such as wearing a mask, staying away from other people, and washing your hands frequently for five extra days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaty Rivera said you should take this one step further because “resolving symptoms” is completely subjective, she noted. What’s “resolving” for one person could mean being very sick for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And no fever... fever is not the only indicator... for infectiousness to others,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the evidence, if you are testing positive on a rapid antigen test, that means that you are likely infectious to others. If you are infectious to others, that means you should be isolating from other people and wearing a mask in indoor settings if you’re forced to be in indoor settings with other people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need fresh air, it’s OK to go outside without a mask, but you shouldn’t be close to other people, said Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think people should be unmasked in places with other people unless they are testing negative on an antigen test,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are sick, you can also check with your doctor to see if you’re eligible for Paxlovid, which is an anti-viral COVID medication, Malaty Rivera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are things you can do to prevent a COVID infection, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you didn’t get an updated COVID vaccine in the past year, it might be a good time to get one, especially before any changes in eligibility come into effect,” said Dowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are over 65 or immunocompromised, you’re eligible for another COVID shot, she added, so long as you’re&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" six months out from your last dose" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt; six months out from your last dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But, besides protection from vaccines, when there is more COVID around, it’s a good time to ramp up our trusty precautions that work for most respiratory viruses,” Dowd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This includes paying attention to ventilation when socializing (such as being outside or opening doors and windows [and] using HEPA filters), staying home when sick and masking strategically in higher-risk situations like airplane travel or other crowded places,” noted Dowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

      &lt;p&gt;The first human case of West Nile virus this season has been confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) says one person has tested positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito and residents are urged to take precautions such as wearing bug spray, removing standing water from their property, wearing long sleeves and pants and reducing time outdoors during dusk and dawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important for everyone to eliminate any standing water around their property and take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites even as we approach the cooler fall months", said Dr. Aloosh, Medical Officer of Health, Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WECHU says symptoms usually start to show within 2-14 days after a bite and can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph glands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over the age of 50 and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/template&gt;

However, she ended up being diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Everybody was telling me I’m going through perimenopause,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/mom-reveals-cervical-cancer-sign-dismissed-rcna221912" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Today.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “I didn’t make a big deal about it. I just put up with it for another two months. But then I started getting contractions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders, who works as a flagger, told the outlet, “My mom was like, ‘Melissa, all of us go through it.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was like, ‘I don’t know mom because when you were going through this, I don’t remember you being in this much pain.’ And then I was like, ‘There is no way this is just perimenopause,’ ” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A stock photo of a nurse testing for cervical cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of perimenopause, which "is the time before menopause when your body is getting ready to stop having periods," can include your periods being longer or shorter, as well as hot flashes, trouble sleeping and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After multiple months of non-stop, heavy bleeding, Sanders recalled experiencing contraction-like pains, which led to her making an appointment to get a &lt;a href="https://people.com/cervical-cancer-screening-hpv-pap-smear-8759164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pap smear;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pap smear&lt;/a&gt; in March 2024, per the outlet. It had been 22 years since she had last had one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I never worried about me,” Sanders told the outlet. “I was a single mom with three kids, and I worked. So, they did their routines, doctors, dentists, but I just never had the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders' doctor scheduled a biopsy after her pap smear; however, they stopped performing it "within two minutes of starting it," Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I had cancerous skin falling off my cervix, just falling off, and there was ooze," she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders said her doctor could tell she had a mass by feeling it, before a further MRI and PET scan confirmed she had stage 3 cervical cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation for six months, Today.com reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders admitted that during that time, she felt "really, really weak," adding to the outlet, “My son pretty much had to carry (me) around at my last radiation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders finished the treatments, which ended up putting her in menopause, in September 2024, and her scans have been clear since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite not being able to stand as long as she was able to before, and feeling like she needs to "gain all" her "muscles back," Sanders is hopeful for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I got to put me first,” she told the outlet. “I try to do everything healthier. I just walked three miles the other day with my daughter and grandbaby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She insisted she wants to start putting her heath first, so she can see her granddaughter, Gracelynn, grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders recalled of the cancer diagnosis, “I was sad. But I didn’t give up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people have that mindset that life is too busy. But it really isn’t,” she insisted, urging others to get their checks done. “It’s very important to keep up with your pap smears, mammograms.

Cervical cancer found at an early stage is usually easier to treat.

Most of them were unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16186" class="body-graf"&gt;That's why some doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people, especially children, who are afraid of needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2af093" class="body-graf"&gt;AstraZeneca's FluMist Home, which was approved last fall, is now available with a prescription for children ages 2 and over, and adults up to age 49.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32cf81" class="body-graf"&gt;A 2019 review from researchers at the University of Michigan found the majority of children and up to 30% of young adults are &lt;a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/147205/jan13818.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;afraid of needles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e6326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy, board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, said many children are scared because they aren't old enough to understand what vaccines are and why they are important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8da693" class="body-graf"&gt;“Most of the time, the anxiety and worry before the shot is scarier than the actual shot,” Hoy said.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-df85f1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg" alt="FluMist Home is only available online.

However, after the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html" target="_blank"&gt;2009 swine flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; introduced the new H1N1 strain, several studies found the nasal spray was less effective than other flu vaccines. This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flumist-nose-spray-vaccine-doesn-t-work-experts-say-n597411" target="_blank"&gt;recommend against using the nasal spray in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the CDC said the nasal spray accounted for &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2016/s0622-laiv-flu.html" target="_blank"&gt;one-third of all flu vaccines &lt;/a&gt;given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f075ed" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, FluMist’s manufacturers reformulated it to more closely match circulating strains, including H1N1, and the nasal spray returned in 2018. Like injectable flu vaccines, FluMist is updated each season based on recommendations from global health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41bf7f" class="body-graf"&gt;“FluMist’s efficacy is comparable to injectable flu vaccines and is a safe and effective needle-free option for flu protection,” AstraZeneca spokesperson Andrew Leone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7bcca" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say it’s too early to tell how bad the upcoming flu season will be.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59fbe1" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, flu vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40% and 60% effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing severe illness, and FluMist Home should be equally protective. The doses for the 2026-2027 season contain three virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and a B strain from the B/Victoria lineage, according to the drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452946" class="body-graf"&gt;The FluMist Home vaccine contains a weakened form of a live virus to stimulate the immune system. Pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems are advised to talk with their doctor before using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9064fb" class="body-heading"&gt;Does insurance cover it? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59db30" class="body-graf"&gt;FluMist Home is available only online. People ordering the nasal spray will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire at &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist.com&lt;/a&gt; that is reviewed by a health care professional, according to the drugmaker. FluMist Home’s online pharmacy will then collect the insurance information and bill the health plan directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b34b7" class="body-graf"&gt;A temperature monitor on the packaging will verify that the vaccine has been maintained at the appropriate temperature during shipping and delivery. Green means it's safe to use. Red means it's not.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-283a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Christina Aungst, senior pharmacy editor at GoodRx, estimates people with insurance will likely only have to pay an $8.99 shipping fee for the nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40d601" class="body-graf"&gt;“Currently, if you don’t have insurance, FluMist is only available in a health care setting,” AstraZeneca's Leone said. “We hope to provide a cash pay option for FluMist Home in future seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be6052" class="body-graf"&gt;When FluMist is given in a health care office or clinic, most insurance plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/medicare/does-medicare-cover-flu-shots" target="_blank"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/vaccines/medicaid-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; — will cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3496b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine, worries people may not administer the nasal spray vaccine properly without a doctor's supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c35fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“What if they have a runny nose? How far back do they need to spray in the nose? What if they store it incorrectly in their house?” Roberts asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adf462" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kristina Bryant, pediatric infectious diseases physician at Norton Children’s in Louisville, Kentucky, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the bottom line is that all the available flu vaccines offer comparable protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-237101" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The most important thing to know is that vaccines only work if they are actually administered,” Bryant said. “Hopefully, the availability of a vaccine that can be administered in the home will make it easier for some people to be protected against flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQVlNtNXA3UE5jNEhsNXZ6aWZjZVBqT1IyY1FRTnk5enB2NlQ1T0o2LXJQUXd4TXVMN21pVjIyZTZjeWotcFIzMlRFdHJqVUNNTEpYd0h3dHhuUGVlRmpxY2lCTlNCdjFGeU5vaDc1TjhuT2t3enZFbWYzUVNvdGFvRkozcnBOYzVIekV3ZXg4RWNGYWItVmVvd250c01oSzNJWFc2Q0pNRHJQZ9IBVkFVX3lxTFBNTFZNSzlpaHdNLTRNU04xM0lmbWFIeF9fQm9FUEllYVZWZGV1SDlXOEFGNWhvTGRKQWZNdjF0N2FKOEJHX0NWODVQNFhSVkNTMDVIaml3</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州，有“角”的兔子被称为“弗兰肯斯坦兔子”。’原因如下-东爱达荷新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPc3FsYzVqdEJhT2E0em1aTEFXYm5MbDZWdkpZRUpFLUhxbFNCSHlzMkp2RlQ0TzBQcVpqek9BMUFFdllUbzBhTWJzNk1uVjJmQUh1R2E0Y3ZDaEFZTGhpYnIxVTlJS2Y3d1FyQUV0VXVmbWx3MUYxM3NXZFdRNzhvd25ZbXBMb1N5NW9WRFlGWklGNVFnRnd1eEFUbERhdk02bC1LaGxLSkF5aHU3MXczYjFZdm8tNG41?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;DENVER (AP) — A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there’s no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she said that it’s not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active.

The American Heart Association just released a big report on ultra-processed foods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Some ultra-processed foods are healthier than others, according to the organization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Experts say it’s still important to limit how much ultra-processed foods you eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods have been a hot topic in nutrition, with a government &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in May linking this food category to a range of chronic diseases. Now, the American Heart Association (AHA) has released a new scientific advisory statement, breaking down the best and worst ultra-processed foods you can eat, and their impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This echoes a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/ultra-processed-foods-what-you-should-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:growing argument;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;growing argument&lt;/a&gt; in the nutrition and health community, especially given that up to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-024-01095-7.epdf&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65677759%2Fworst-best-ultra-processed-foods-american-heart-association%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:70%;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of our food supply is made up of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are such a large part of the American diet, and whatever we can do to steer our diet toward healthier options would be beneficial to our cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition expert, weight loss surgeon, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA; Keri Gans, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65677759%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/kathy-moore" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathleen Moore, R.D.N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kathleen Moore, R.D.N&lt;/a&gt;., a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, which ultra-processed foods are considered “healthier” and what does this mean for your diet going forward? Doctors and a dietitian explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are ultra-processed foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The levels of food processing are classified under something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970#:~:text=NOVA%20has%20classified%20food%20into,%E2%80%9CUltra%2Dprocessed%E2%80%9D%20foods." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA scale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;. This scale lumps foods into these four main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: This includes foods that are in their natural state or barely altered, like strawberries, carrots, and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: These ingredients are created through minimal processing, like pressing, refining, grinding, or milling. The category includes things like olive oil and almond flour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods in this category are changed from their natural state. They usually have sugar, oil, salt, or other substances added. Canned tuna and some cheese fall under this umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods contain ingredients like artificial colors and flavors, preservatives for shelf stability, and other ingredients to preserve texture. Many packaged foods are considered ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the report say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report doesn’t have great things to say about ultra-processed foods, calling them a “growing public health challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more, “most ultra-processed foods overlap with foods high in saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, which are already targets for cardiometabolic risk reduction,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report lists a link between ultra-processed foods and a range of serious health complications, including heart attacks, stroke, sleep disorders, depression, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. But the report also stresses the importance of identifying “high-risk” ultra-processed foods subgroups to break down healthier options within this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By encouraging people to have less of the most harmful ultra-processed foods and steering them more towards “a small number of select, affordable ultra-processed foods of better diet quality,” people may improve their health risks, the review says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best ultra-processed foods &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AHA stops short of saying that certain ultra-processed foods are actually healthy. But the organization flags some options as being better for you than others. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-sodium whole-grain breads and crackers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-sugar yogurts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomato sauces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut- or bean-based spreads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored dry-roasted chickpeas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsweetened, dried fruit-based snacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsweetened high-fiber cereal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based meat and dairy alternatives that are low in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat, like soy milk and tofu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some ultra-processed foods can provide essential nutrients,” says Keri Gans, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65677759%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In contrast, others are loaded with added sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats. Knowing the difference helps you choose options that work best for your health and your lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods “can actually provide useful nutrients and help people get affordable, convenient foods—especially when fresh options are harder to find,” says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition expert, weight loss surgeon, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labeling some ultra-processed foods as better than others may also help people make more informed choices, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/kathy-moore" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathleen Moore, R.D.N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kathleen Moore, R.D.N&lt;/a&gt;., a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Labeling all ultra-processed foods as ‘bad’ may discourage the consumption of some nutrient-rich convenient options, like whole grain breads, cereals and cereal bars, yogurt, and grab-and-go meals,” she says. “Sometimes it is useful to use some ultra-processed foods to save time or to incorporate balanced meal options when fresh foods are limited. Knowing which ultra-processed foods are more healthy will help consumers make better choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The worst ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AHA also broke down the least healthy ultra-processed foods. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken nuggets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sausage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot dogs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquid cheese products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cookies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gummy fruit snacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined grain breads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortillas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy-based desserts like ice cream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready-to-heat meals made with refined grains, high fats, or processed meats like boxed macaroni and cheese or pizza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortilla- and potato-based chips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it OK to eat a lot of ‘healthy’ ultra-processed foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the AHA report called out healthier versions of ultra-processed foods, experts say that still doesn’t mean you should load up. “These can provide beneficial nutrients and fit into a balanced diet,” Gans says. “However, still pair them with plenty of whole and minimally processed foods for optimal health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen agrees. “As much as possible, we should aim to eat whole foods rather than processed foods,” he says. But these foods have an important role for some people, as Moore points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work with many clients who incorporate ultra-processed foods into their weekly schedules for a variety of reasons,” she says. “Some cannot seem to find time for breakfast, or have a work schedule that makes sitting down for lunch difficult. I have clients who are busy parents and benefit from a frozen family meal or ‘grab and go’ meal when sports events make it difficult to eat a home-cooked meal. Overall, I encourage my patients to limit ultra-processed foods to less than half of their overall consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim suggests trying to have these foods in moderation. “Think of ‘healthier’ ultra-processed foods as a tool—something you can lean on when they help make your diet more balanced or easier to stick to, but not something to make the star of your plate at every meal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to reduce ultra-processed foods in your diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to reduce ultra-processed foods in your diet is to focus on whole foods first, according to Gans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be prepared. Stock your pantry with nutrient-rich staples like canned tomatoes, beans, and oatmeal,” she says. “Include more fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, and make small swaps, like 100% whole-grain bread for white.” In a perfect scenario, Gans says that the first ingredient in the things you eat should be a whole food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’re at it, Dr. Kim suggests cutting back on the “worst offenders,” especially sugary drinks, processed meats, packaged sweets, and salty snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fewer ultra-processed foods you eat, the better—but it’s about progress, not perfection,” Dr. Kim says. “Swap out the unhealthy ones first, make room for healthier stand-ins when needed, and keep working toward a diet built mostly from whole, real foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5MTks5eDAxRWVhaThiSFpXa0x0eGozZzhXRjhFOGNoY2FlMURtdE9DV3c3VERLcHA1bFY0UE45cVdzRkZNMV9zaS1FRlJYMXBrZE44SEFFTEV2OHlsa2hRR214enhHZG90b1B6d2lTNXpfRFo1TTg1dUktNHQyUQ</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团病集群增至99例， 4人死亡- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNbHpPRzczQmFjdEgxVVFqU3VzN25IZng0bC12NGNsSnZyRlhHYmxFTEoyZGR0ZTA4MGxiSl9rTmptZjVpU1VNWHZjQXpyY01HR1VWS19Ha0xYaTZWVk5wLXl5YmZsTG4talVJUk9ZWDdXbUVqeExWS2JkM2tTZFBSNzlmV0vSAYoBQVVfeXFMTVJpd0ZRLXA0OGQ2YzNtTTBoMDlLLUxyRjdxRWstWjBocjQySnFIbks0TmtVcHc2VVNNVWU3NHFCUHdSVFYtRkV0S3U0NUVYNy0yTEtPeXFmM0t3TVp0VGw5R25aVVFIc1kzeWprSnpBRDhreHNwb3pmQjUxRnRYZmdqREtuRmJ2U1pB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fsite%2Fdoh%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-topics%2Flegionnaires-disease.page&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7C8ee77209fc3646fca65708dddbff5e5a%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638908612143625370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=BFfVpeWuCjffe2%2B5W%2B%2F%2F0OZDo86Iq8C35QLlPbHeaLE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;99 cases, including four deaths&lt;/a&gt;.

            Health officials suspect the bacteria that causes the disease, Legionella, originated cooling towers — devices that uses water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired and the final tower should be remediated by Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00073b6oh1h9ib2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00083b6o11jftlw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This community outbreak is not related to a building’s hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner,” it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed769e500003b6qc3mzqvdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed7gqm500043b6qqrcamh34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained,” Morse said. “New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00093b6on1retlm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fsite%2Fdoh%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-topics%2Flegionnaires-disease.page&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7C8ee77209fc3646fca65708dddbff5e5a%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638908612143625370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=BFfVpeWuCjffe2%2B5W%2B%2F%2F0OZDo86Iq8C35QLlPbHeaLE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;99 cases, including four deaths&lt;/a&gt;.

            Health officials suspect the bacteria that causes the disease, Legionella, originated cooling towers — devices that uses water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired and the final tower should be remediated by Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00073b6oh1h9ib2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00083b6o11jftlw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This community outbreak is not related to a building’s hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner,” it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed769e500003b6qc3mzqvdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed7gqm500043b6qqrcamh34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained,” Morse said. “New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00093b6on1retlm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Some people do this quickly by starting with a "loading" phase of 20 grams per day for a week and then lowering to 5 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Loading isn't necessary though, Professor Cooke said, because you get the same results by starting at 5 grams per day, it will just take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;For most people it will result in more power and strength for explosive bursts of exercise and it improves recovery after exercise-related muscle damage as well as sarcopenia (loss of muscle as we age) if taken in conjunction with resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Recently, researchers started delving deeper into the potential benefits of creatine among women and how it might assist during hormonal fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ContentAlignment_marginBottom__4H_6E ContentAlignment_overflowAuto__c1_IL ContentAlignment_outdentDesktop__ijbiK

Cockburn&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;During menopause, estrogen and progesterone levels decline significantly which may negatively impact creatine metabolism so supplementation could be beneficial at this time, Professor Cooke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Research has shown creatine supplementation can help post-menopausal women with physical function when combined with resistance training and now experts want to explore how it might support bone health during perimenopause when bone density starts to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's early days but research is also suggesting supplementation may benefit pre-menopausal women during their menstrual cycles when there's varying levels of creatine metabolism and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Some brands are now shamelessly trying to capture the female market by using taglines like "craft your perfect peach" or advertising "creatine for women" when it’s exactly the same as the "genderless" creatine on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Professor Cooke said some brands may be capitalising on the recent research that's been more focused on women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

   &lt;p&gt;Children who go to emergency departments in a mental health crisis and need to be hospitalized often end up stuck there for days, a new study finds. That happens in roughly one in ten of all mental health emergency visits for children enrolled in Medicaid across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most common mental health crises that led to such extended stays, or boarding, were depressive disorders and suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837523" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study published in JAMA Health Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"So a child shows up at an emergency department with a mental health condition, [and] about one in ten times, they're staying for three days or longer," says lead study author &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/kjohn-mcconnell-phd-ms-ma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;John McConnell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Health Systems Effectiveness at Oregon Health and Science University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McConnell and his colleagues also found that in a handful of states, including North Carolina, Florida and Maine, as many as 25% of mental health visits led to kids boarding at the emergency department for 3-7 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings aren't surprising, says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205956968/jennifer-havens" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jennifer Havens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But having data like this is very important to see the effect across the country," she adds. Havens was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Boarding in the emergency department has been a growing issue across the nation for decades, but the rise has been particularly dramatic in recent years for pediatric mental health cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As the children's behavioral health crisis nationwide has increased, states have not been able to keep up with behavioral health systems," says &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/rebecca-marshall-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Rebecca Marshall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at OHSU, who also wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Though the study looked only at Medicaid claims, the problem happens for children on private health insurance, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really have struggled to build capacity over time to increase the number of inpatient beds," she says. "And so often what happens is kids will come into the hospital, they need an inpatient psychiatric bed and there isn't one available. So then they wait until a child in one of the psychiatric units discharges and a bed becomes available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many states have a shockingly low number of psychiatric beds for kids, says Marshall. For example, Oregon has only 38 beds for highest need pediatric psychiatric cases. "And then we have less than 200 residential beds, and that's a lower acuity treatment program that tends to be longer term."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's an enormous problem across the country with a lack of access to mental health services, both on the [inpatient and] outpatient side," says Havens. Adequate outpatient services can prevent kids with mental health conditions from reaching a crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without adequate outpatient and inpatient mental health care options, families are more likely to take their child to an ER if the child is in a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But "what they find when they go to the emergency department is that there often isn't any available care," says Marshall. "There's nothing immediate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most ERs don't even have a child and adolescent psychiatrist, says Havens, "because we've just never invested in the resources to have this kind of service for kids."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when children in mental health crises end up stuck in ERs for days, their symptoms can worsen even if there's a psychiatrist on staff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of these children boarding in an ER end up stuck in "one small room," says Marshall, sometimes a windowless room. "They're not able to leave the room. They can't exercise. They're not able to interact with other kids, which is a really important part of development. And often there are not any kind of additional therapeutic activities that you would find in an inpatient unit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure what the right words are, but, [it's] really challenging, heartbreaking situation for families that have a child and they're trying to kind of find a place to stabilize them, and they're stuck in the emergency department," says McConnell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;An elderly Sebastopol man has died after contracting &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/what-to-know-about-legionnaires-disease-which-has-sickened-dozens-in-new/" id="link-d52e038a557671b611e3f614cfae36c6" target="_self"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt;, a serious form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria, Sonoma County health officials said Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Interim Health Officer Karen Smith said the death is being investigated as a “sporadic case,” meaning it is considered an isolated incident, not an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said her team is in contact with the family of the man who died but is giving them time to grieve before seeking a more thorough account of the man’s last days. The incubation period for Legionella bacteria can be up to 14 days, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sonoma County, there have been three cases of Legionnaires’ pneumonia since the beginning of the year, she said, adding that none of them have been connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said Legionella is a very common environmental bacteria often found in “free water“ such as lakes and streams, as well as artificial water reservoirs such as cooling towers in large buildings, air conditioning systems, hot tubs and water heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria thrives in warm water that’s a little bit stagnant, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons no one tests wastewater for Legionella is because you’re going to find it there,” she said. “It’s a naturally occurring bacteria and the vast majority of people never get Legionella infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastopol Interim City Manager Mary Gourley said the city does not test for the Legionella bacteria but keeps “a residual chlorine level ... that is 99% effective against” the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said there has to be a lot of the bacteria to cause an infection. But more importantly, she said, the people who tend to get sick from Legionella are older with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionella spreads when small droplets of water containing the bacteria get into the air and people breathe them in. In very rare cases, someone breathes in Legionella while drinking water. Generally, people do not spread Legionnaires’ disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease are similar to other types of pneumonia, and include cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache. One in 10 individuals who contract Legionnaires’ disease will die from the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said that more than 75% of people with Legionella are over 60, and many of them either have conditions like cancer that suppress the immune system or are on medications that suppress the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith declined to discuss the Sebastopol man’s health, saying only that he was “both older and he had a immunosuppressive condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sebastopol community is shocked by the death, with businesses and nonprofits mourning the man’s death on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks do occur, Smith said, &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/north-bay/cdc-report-finds-possible-source-for-deadly-2022-legionnaires-disease-outb/" id="link-3370f0e5c10da50c1e397ae1a2ab9cc6" target="_self"&gt;citing one in Napa County that involved multiple cases in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak, in downtown Napa, killed one person and hospitalized 16 others. It was linked to a cooling tower at an unspecified facility, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7249a1.htm" id="link-d81f88079a3619799166687489c761d3" target="_self"&gt;according to a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak occurred from July to August 2022. The report linked some of the cases to a cooling tower, a structure that contains water and a fan used to cool buildings. A clogged pipe that led to the chemical feed system at the facility impeded the controller’s ability to detect water flow, resulting in low or no injection of biocide — or disinfectant — into the tower, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooling towers have been identified as the likely source of a current outbreak in Harlem, New York City, that has resulted in 99 cases and four deaths. New York City officials have identified 12 cooling towers in 10 buildings that have tested positive for the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said there is no indication or evidence that this infection is tied to a large community water source.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON – Guyana is the only Caribbean Community (Caricom) country that has a confirmed case of the Oropouche fever, a viral disease that has resurged across the Americas since late 2023, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest epidemiological update, PAHO said that so far this year, 12,786 confirmed cases have been reported across 11 countries — seven with local transmission and four with imported cases — reflecting the growing spread of this virus, primarily transmitted by the Culicoides paraensis midge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PAHO, from January 1 to July 27, this year, Brazil has the highest confirmed cases with 11,888 cases, followed by Panama (501), Peru (330), Cuba (28), Colombia (26), five cases in Venezuela and one case in Guyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said imported cases have been reported in Uruguay, Chile, Canada and the United States. In 2024, the region recorded 16,239 cases across 11 countries and one territory, including four deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said that Oropouche fever typically causes high fever, severe headaches, and muscle and joint pain, with most patients recovering in two to three weeks, though up to 60 per cent may experience relapses. In rare cases, it can lead to meningitis or encephalitis, and in pregnant women, there are concerns about potential fetal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus’s spread to non-endemic areas is driven by factors like climate change, deforestation, and urbanisation of forested areas, which boost the midge population, it said, emphasising the need for stronger epidemiological surveillance and vector control to curb the disease, which currently has no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said that the key PAHO recommendations to countries in the region include adapting actions based on the epidemiological situation in each country to detect the virus’s introduction into new areas, monitor its spread in areas with local transmission, and properly characterize the epidemiological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said there is the need to eliminate midge breeding sites by clearing vegetation and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, prevent bites by using bed nets, protective clothing, and repellents containing DEET, IR3535, or icaridin, especially for pregnant women and rural workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, countries are being urged to strengthen early clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis, particularly with dengue and that treatment focuses on relieving pain and fever, ensuring hydration, and managing vomiting, while monitoring for neurological complications or issues in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PAHO stresses that national and regional collaboration is essential to monitor and control the spread of the virus, especially amid the circulation of other arboviruses like dengue. The organization is supporting countries with technical guidance on diagnosis, clinical management, and vector prevention and control, urging prompt reporting of unusual events, such as deaths or cases of vertical transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus was first detected in 1955 in a febrile forest worker in a village in Trinidad and Tobago called Vega de Oropouche, near the Oropouche River. Oropouche virus is endemic to the Amazon basin.&lt;/span&gt; - CMC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The meds would go up and up, and up and she would pass in her sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2aefe0" class="body-graf"&gt;The tumor rested near Fletcher’s brain stem, and doctors thought  the mass would encroach on it, which could eventually stop the infant’s breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3511f3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a miracle in itself that we made it home,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We came home and tried to live life with her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b32f" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple prioritized showing their daughter as much as possible in what they thought would be her short life. When it rained, they took Fletcher — hooked to oxygen and a feeding tube — outside so she could feel the rain. Even though doctors thought Fletcher would never be able to suck, her parents gave her a pacifier, which she sucked. So, they gave her a bottle, and she drank it. Fletcher did many things that doctors told the Fazenbakers she’d never do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-634830" class="body-graf"&gt;“(By the first week's) end, she’s already doing a couple (of) normal baby things, which was amazing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-29cf51" class="body-graf"&gt;About a month passed, and then Fletcher and the family returned to the hospital to see if the baby could undergo another MRI or they could receive “some form of clarity that we were doing the right thing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c76a95" class="body-graf"&gt;“They said, ‘Just soak up your time. Sometimes when they’re in a home environment, a loving environment, they can do well for a little bit a time. But there’s nothing we can do,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “They wouldn’t even place a shunt in her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34c73" class="body-graf"&gt;Her parents had hoped a shunt, a surgically implanted tube that helps to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, could reduce some of the pressure in Fletcher’s brain. Doctors didn’t believe the infant could survive the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c05c52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was alive, and we were loving it,” Billy Fazenbaker says. “But (we were) almost grieving her while she was alive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08a962" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher turned 2 months old, the Fazenbakers wanted a second opinion and contacted a “reputable” hospital for a consultation. They were devastated by that meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-474e84" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctor was like, ‘Look, I don’t even think it’s worth you driving here after seeing her through Zoom. I agree with (the hospital) where you delivered opinion, and I think you should enjoy your time,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “His exact words were, ‘You wouldn’t be doing something for her. You would be doing something to her.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-7a6710"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

They were “literally begging God for a walk-on-water miracle.” Soon after Fletcher turned 3 months old, their hospice nurse mentioned St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and asked if the couple had reached out to them. Immediately, they filled out an application for a second opinion. Forty-eight hours later, they received a call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb195a" class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s like, ‘So I think we can help you.’ How soon can you get here,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “(It) was the most exciting thing ever.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-417f1a" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple drove to Memphis and was stunned by what Dr. Aditi Bagchi told them when they met in November 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52ef52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was like, ‘This is going to be a really bumpy road, but I think we can cure her,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We went from hearing, ‘Go home on hospice and enjoy your time’ to ‘I think I can save your baby.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57eb25" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi believed that Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma, a tumor that she could treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2c4f0c" class="body-heading"&gt;Infant-Type Hemispheric Gliomas &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11316d" class="body-graf"&gt;Until recently, doctors would sometimes see newborns, like Fletcher, with high-grade gliomas. Doctors thought that these brain tumors were the same as the aggressive brain tumor known as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/glioblastoma-symptoms-migraine-rcna218836" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; that occurs in older children and adults. But clinical observations and ongoing research indicated that these gliomas found in infants behave differently. In 2021, doctors named them infant-type hemispheric gliomas to differentiate them from glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24e01" class="body-graf"&gt;“Research over the last decade or so has slowly given us hints that these tumors, which these little babies are getting, are different from the glioma that we see in older individuals,” Bagchi, a neuro-oncologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, tells TODAY.com. “It’s a relatively new … reclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-76132a"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1406"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

With new DNA and RNA sequencing methods, experts were able to confirm that the infant-grade hemispheric gliomas have “different genetic drivers” than glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81d135" class="body-graf"&gt;“Their genome looks very different from the high-grade gliomas diagnosed in older children,” Bagchi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512f77" class="body-graf"&gt;As they are rare and newly classified, there’s a lack of awareness about infant-type hemispheric gliomas among doctors which could lead to delayed diagnosis, as in Fletcher’s case. It’s not uncommon for parents to hear the same devastating news the Fazenbakers did — that there is nothing doctors can do to help their infant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38fa6a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you look at these babies and their MRIs, these tumors are huge and they are scary looking,” Bagchi says. “They are misdiagnosed a lot of times.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-591c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi says it’s important to raise awareness of infant-type hemispheric gliomas so that doctors in community hospitals can direct these patients to children’s hospitals for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-883aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t have to know how to cure it,” she says. “You just have to reach out to us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-80be59" class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of infant-type hemispheric gliomas often are not present until birth. Though prenatal scans can sometimes identify a blood clot in the brain or detect that the head is larger than usual. In some cases, babies are born with normal-sized heads, but they begin growing larger. In babies who are not diagnosed at birth, they can experience signs including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-00305d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weakness on one side of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-3ebecc" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being able to eat or drink &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-65eacd" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bulging soft spot on the head&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c60b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment depends on the “molecular characteristics” of the tumor found upon biopsy of the tumor. Some tumors have genetic markers that respond to targeted therapy, while chemotherapy treats tumors without those markers. When the tumor shrinks, doctors can remove the mass from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37a4d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Delayed treatment can lead to developmental delays for many babies. But still, their tumors can be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d32f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is life-saving for them to appropriately diagnose them and treat them,” Bagchi says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eedcf6" class="body-graf"&gt;In early 2026, Bagchi is launching a clinical trial to develop a standardized treatment protocol for infant-type hemispheric glioma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8ef846" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Just Incredible’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52c292" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher met Bagchi, the infant’s head was the size of a 5-year-old’s. Immediately, doctors scheduled a surgery to place a shunt in Fletcher’s brain to drain some of the excess fluid and reduce some of the pressure. Since the skin on Fletcher’s skull was very thin from “her head expanding,” doctors worried about the shunt staying in place — yet it did. Recovering from surgery was still tough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b605b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a really bumpy road after that,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She had sodium issues and really was unstable because she was draining so much fluid. Her head was changing so much, and her body was trying to adjust.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2603bd"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

The tumor’s size meant that Fletcher’s eyes angled downward so she couldn’t look at her parents. Almost immediately after the shunt was placed, she could see better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-319c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The day after she had the shunt (implanted) is one of our very favorite days,” Stevee Fazenbaker says while crying. “That was really the first time she ever looked at us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33faac" class="body-graf"&gt;By Christmas, Fletcher stabilized, and Bagchi performed a biopsy, which confirmed Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma. The tumor had the markers that made it responsive to targeted treatment, an oral medication her parents gave her through a small tube that extended from her nose to her esophagus. From January to March, she took the medication twice a day, and it “shrunk her tumor in half.” In March 2023, Fletcher underwent surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e98bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were able to completely remove her entire tumor, which was just incredible,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b971d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher continued taking the targeted medication for the next seven months. This upcoming October will mark two years since she finished treatment. Since then, Fletcher’s scans have been clear, and she’s been thriving. She does have some developmental delays and spends her days in various therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93d25a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Finally, she has control, holding her head completely on her own,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She’s sitting on her own with a little bit of support around her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6329a" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher is a “very sweet, very, very happy girl,” who is sometimes “spicy,” especially when she’s over participating in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f8359" class="body-graf"&gt;“She loves listening to music and stories. She loves being on the go,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She loves being outside. She loves all weather. She loves it when it rains. She loves it when it’s windy. She loves when the sun’s on her face.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf1f83" class="body-graf"&gt;The family hopes Fletcher’s story encourages people to seek second opinions if their child is sick.

&lt;p&gt;TWIN FALLS COUNTY, Idaho — The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare confirmed the state's first West Nile virus-related death of 2025, involving a Twin Falls County person over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said the death was due to West Nile virus encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus can cause fever-related illness or brain and spinal cord infections, including meningitis or encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department announced the fatality on Friday and emphasized the need for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; spreads through bites from infected mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the virus has been detected in mosquitoes across seven southern Idaho counties and neighboring Malheur County, Oregon. However, it is important to note that not all counties collect and test mosquitoes for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families," said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Kathy Turner. "This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the department, most people infected with the West Nile virus show no symptoms. Those infected develop fever along with symptoms including headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe illness affects the brain and spinal cord in approximately one in 150 infected people, often requiring hospitalization. About 10% of those with severe West Nile virus die from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with certain medical conditions face higher risks of severe illness. Recovery from serious cases may take weeks or months, with some effects potentially permanent.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department recommends avoiding mosquitoes, particularly between dusk and dawn when they are most active. Prevention measures include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wearing loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants outdoors. Applying EPA-registered insect repellents to exposed skin, following label instructions carefully for children. Using clothing and gear treated with permethrin&lt;br&gt;Covering strollers and baby carriers with mosquito netting. Repairing or replacing damaged screens to insect-proof homes. Eliminating standing water on property by checking and draining outdoor containers. Changing water in bird baths, decorative ponds and animal tanks weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA provides a search tool for finding &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;appropriate repellents&lt;/a&gt;, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers an&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Insect Repellent Chatbot for guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes they may be sick from West Nile virus should consult their healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your wallet getting as thin as your hair thanks to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/lifestyle/from-rogaine-to-robots-trendiest-hacks-balding-men-using-to-get-their-hair-back/"&gt;pricey pills and potions&lt;/a&gt; promising to save your strands?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not alone. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/most-men-experience-hair-loss-it-isnt-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;80% of men and nearly half of women&lt;/a&gt; will face significant hair loss in their lifetime, fueling a multi-billion-dollar industry selling quick fixes that don’t always work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you empty your pockets, know this: There are a few simple everyday steps that one trichologist says can help protect your hair and keep it it looking fuller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hair loss can lead to decreased self-esteem, anxiety and even depression in some people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.advancedtrichology.com/pages/william-gaunitz-trichologist-hair-loss-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Trichology&lt;/a&gt;, shared five easy, effective ways to support scalp health and fight hair loss from home.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave The Post a heads-up about three popular hair hacks that could actually wind up doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#1. Soak up some sunlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Get out in the sun for 15 minutes with no sunscreen to get a balanced amount of vitamin D3,” Gaunitz advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for creating the cells that develop into hair follicles. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; a deficiency may contribute to issues like excessive shedding and female pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re staying out longer than 15 minutes, don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/09/health/what-to-know-about-picking-sunscreen-including-2-key-ingredients/"&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt; — even a small amount of time under a strong UV index without protection can lead to a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Up to 40% of women will experience some degree of female pattern hair loss by age 50. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nadya Kolobova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#2. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one thing is more important than anything else,” Gaunitz stressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t eat animal protein or follow another special diet, he warned there’s an “extremely high” chance you’ll drain your nutrient stores unless you carefully replace them with other sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Discover your blood type and eat accordingly,” Gaunitz recommended. “That is a great way to understand what your body needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist, has been working in the hair loss industry since 2002. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/williamgaunitztrichologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#3. Check your gut health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have any consistent problems, like constipation, diarrhea or acid reflux, it is possible that your nutrient supply absorption may have been compromised,” Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means your body might not be absorbing nutrients properly even if you’re eating right — and those nutrient issues can impact your whole body, including your hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#4 Don’t skip shampoo days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair at a minimum of every 48 hours with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-shampoos-for-every-hair-type-review/"&gt;healthy shampoo&lt;/a&gt; that has some type of antimicrobial oil in it, like grapefruit seed, rosemary, tea tree or thyme,” Gaunitz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping microbial overload in check gently and consistently is key to managing your scalp’s delicate microbiome without damage, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have shown that regular scalp massage can lead to reduced hair loss and increased hair thickness.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/mimada.beauty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#5 Massage your scalp daily&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you hit the shower, try the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoG8iygEecc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scalp-over-skull massage technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed to boost blood flow to hair follicles, break up mild calcification under the scalp and help clear out excess sebum, an oily substance crucial for hair growth that can be harmful if it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This can drastically improve scalp health,” Gaunitz said. “You can also use a gua sha tool and massage the scalp with the edge, which requires less effort but is still marginally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to ditch from your routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some “hacks” are doing more harm than good. Gaunitz said to skip these three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Dermarolling daily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This handheld microneedling device may seem like a quick fix, but “dermarolling at home daily is a bad idea because it can create scarring and trauma on the scalp, little micro infections, and in many cases will actually make your scalp worse,” Gaunitz warned. “Like anything, it should be done properly by a professional.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While it’s often used to stimulate growth, incorrect or excessive derma rolling can worsen hair loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mishy Skincare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Skipping wash day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The number of times I’ve heard somebody say that they were told by their stylist that they saw online that you shouldn’t wash your hair, and that’s why your hair is falling out, is absurd,” Gaunitz said. “If your scalp is unhealthy, or you are shedding in any way, you need to be shampooing regularly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sebum on your scalp harbors bacteria, fungi and other bodily excretions. Removing this buildup is crucial to preventing further inflammation, Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair daily or at least every 48 hours by scrubbing the surface of your scalp,” he advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. Slathering garlic juice, onion juice or undiluted rosemary oil directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although there are benefits to each of these, applying them directly to the scalp alters the microbiome,” Gaunitz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You should not use them on their own except with a purpose, and they should not be used undiluted.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of “food addiction”, these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-025-01143-7"&gt;Some experts argue&lt;/a&gt; that they’re “specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximise consumption and corporate profits”, hijacking our brain’s reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-and-health-report/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-diet-and-obesity-committees-report-recipe-for-health-a-plan-to-fix-our-broken-food-system"&gt;Policymakers have proposed&lt;/a&gt; bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat – not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub"&gt;We studied more than 3,000 UK adults&lt;/a&gt; and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They’re related, but not identical. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognisable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams – more than 400 in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then compared these responses with three things: the foods’ nutritional content (fat, sugar, fibre, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-022-01099-1"&gt;widely used Nova system&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11575809/"&gt;a food classification method&lt;/a&gt; that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing – and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perception power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered – people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fibre, high-calorie foods as more “bingeable”. But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fibre had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub"&gt;In one survey&lt;/a&gt;, we could predict 78% of the variation in people’s likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what’s actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as “ultra-processed” added very little to our predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ultra-processed-foods-are-everywhere-and-theyre-quietly-raising-health-risks-256419"&gt;not to say all UPFs are harmless&lt;/a&gt;. Many are high in calories, low in fibre and easy to overconsume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together sugary soft drinks with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these products &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2025/spotlight-upfs-nih-explores-link-between-ultra-processed-foods-and-heart-disease"&gt;may be less healthy&lt;/a&gt;, but others can be helpful – especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message that all UPFs are bad &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#Can-UPFs-be-heart-healthy"&gt;oversimplifies the issue&lt;/a&gt;. People don’t eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#which-UPFs-can-be-heart-healthy"&gt;are actually beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what’s genuinely unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalised approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Boost food literacy: help people understand what makes food satisfying, what drives cravings, and how to recognise their personal cues for overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Reformulate with intention: design food products that are enjoyable and filling, rather than relying on bland “diet” options or ultra-palatable snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Address eating motivations: people eat for many reasons beyond hunger – for comfort, connection and pleasure. Supporting alternative habits while maximising enjoyment could reduce dependence on low-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just about processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some UPFs &lt;a href="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pb-0059/"&gt;do deserve concern&lt;/a&gt;. They’re calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they’re not a smoking gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labelling entire categories of food as bad based purely on their processing misses the complexity of eating behaviour. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663318/"&gt;have the data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666324004963"&gt;and models&lt;/a&gt; to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food – and how we perceive them – matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it’s time to stop demonising food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

That individual was hospitalized with the condition earlier this month, the health department said, but is now recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this person was likely infected in the southern half of the county in July, near the Jordan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes, and both health departments urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites to prevent contracting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said Thursday that 108 mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus this year across the state, and because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone near any of those areas should take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's report from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said mosquitoes have been found with West Nile virus in the Bear River Health District, Davis County, Salt Lake County, TriCounty (Uintah, Dagget and Duchesne) and in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported that the percentage of mosquito pools testing positive at this point in the year, 1.53%, is higher than the last two years — 1.41% in 2024 and 0.99% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah health department reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said many who become infected may not even know; between 20% and 30% of infected people will not have symptoms and others will have only minor symptoms. It is estimated that less than 1% of people with West Nile virus develop the neuroinvasive form, which can lead to debilitating complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, there are likely many more than three Utahns who have been infected this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bear River Health Department suggested protection through "the 5 Ds": Drain standing water, avoid outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, use bug spray with DEET, dress in loose, long clothing and ensure door and window screens are repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
