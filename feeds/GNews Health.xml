Although treatments have improved in recent decades, it is not easy to know which ones will work best for which patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now researchers have designed a liquid biopsy that tells doctors how likely a patient is to respond to a specific treatment, even before it begins. The test has the potential to be gamechanging because it means patients could be offered alternative options, and avoid treatments that won’t help them, boosting their chances of beating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test, developed by a team at the Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research, London (ICR), analyses circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), which is released into the blood of patients by cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers measured these microscopic levels of cancer DNA in blood samples from 167 patients. The test was trialled before treatment began and again four weeks later, after a single treatment cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was a strong association between low levels of ctDNA at the start of treatment, and treatment response, according to the team. A similar association was seen with the results taken at four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Iseult Browne, a clinical research fellow at the ICR and first author of a study detailing the test, said: “Our study shows that a simple blood test measuring circulating tumour DNA can provide an early prediction of whether a patients’ breast cancer will respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Knowing this at the earliest stage – in this case, at the start of treatment, or after just four weeks – means that we can avoid giving patients drugs that won’t work and provide them with alternatives before their cancer has a chance to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For example, they could be given an alternative targeted therapy, a combination of drugs, or even enrolled into a clinical trial to test a novel drug. Trials are now under way to see if adapting a patient’s treatment based on these early blood tests does indeed improve their outcome – giving them more time of living well with their cancer kept at bay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the study, funded by Breast Cancer Now, Cancer Research UK, the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust and the ICR, the team analysed blood samples from 167 people with advanced breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patients were split into two groups based on the type of breast cancer and mutations they had. The first group included patients whose cancers had an ESR1, HER2, AKT1, AKT or PTEN mutation, and who received targeted treatments matched to those mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second group consisted of people with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease that constitutes 10-15% of cases globally and has no targetable mutation. They received a combination of the PARP inhibitor olarparib, and the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For patients in the second group, low ctDNA levels before treatment began were associated with longer progression-free survival – 10.2 months, compared with 4.4 months. The percentage of patients who responded to treatment – seeing their tumours shrink or disappear – was 40% for those with low ctDNA levels, compared with 9.7% for those with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A similar, although weaker, association was observed between pre-treatment ctDNA levels and clinical outcomes in the first group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After just four weeks of treatment, patients in the first group with undetectable ctDNA went on to have particularly good outcomes. Their cancer was kept at bay for 10.6 months, compared with 3.5 months for those whose ctDNA was still detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the second group, the blood test after four weeks of treatment also showed a strong link between ctDNA levels and patient outcomes. Patients whose ctDNA was no longer detectable had their cancer kept at bay for 12 months, compared with 4.3 months in patients who still had detectable ctDNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By analysing circulating tumour DNA in blood samples from patients with advanced breast cancer, we identified a clear link between these levels, both at the start and after one cycle of treatment, and how well patients responded to therapy,” Browne said. “These findings support the use of ctDNA as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting outcomes and monitoring treatment response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Nicholas Turner, a professor of molecular oncology at the ICR and a consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden, said: “This research looked at advanced breast cancer, but these tests could also work for early-stage breast cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The liquid biopsy “has the potential to make treatment decisions faster, more personalised and ultimately more effective,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPdzVXNmN3dzdIdExnV3QyZ0xVeElJVjR0N0hDSDNXSFFmY082NURKaDFIcTJnSUlHTklBcG81V1gzSzg2Zl9laDdRRXpMQm5FRVh5OEV5d1JXaGdKclhpaTlqbWxRTEFKZWRacGg2OE1wd0R4QkhaQUdEQTBmcE01RmkzVE9CX2s3TVIwcThPQjk0SXRheVV2d1RRNS1ObmJKNU1nenZxVEs4ZVdkMXkwOFdmc3lBM0VRRlFJLUZWMzhwU2ItNHVCNHFSbmFuODA</guid></item><item><title>我研究了200多名儿童-这是真正教导儿童情商的头号“神奇短语” - CNBC</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/18/child-psychologist-the-no-1-magic-phrase-that-truly-teaches-kids-emotional-intelligence.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-articleBody--AEqcE" id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-styles-makeit-hidden--MFwCR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: "What's wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well-intentioned and it comes from care.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A 35-year-old New York City man paid about $2,500 for a whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that came up healthy — but then suffered a massive stroke less than a year later that the expensive procedure flagged no sign of, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/13/prenuvo-lawsuit-full-body-scan/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Now the stroke victim, Sean Clifford, is &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JejAC0DPndWW/Bequek7Xw==&amp;amp;system=prod" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;suing&lt;/a&gt; the MRI company behind the scan, Prenuvo — which has &lt;a href="https://people.com/we-tried-it-the-full-body-scan-celebrities-love-7509820" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;been endorsed by celebrities&lt;/a&gt; ranging from Paris Hilton to Cindy Crawford — for missing in the scans that 6o percent of his &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mca-stroke" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;proximal right middle cerebral artery&lt;/a&gt;, a common site for strokes, had narrowed and showed “irregularity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Clifford, who suffered a stroke in the same area where the blockage was missed by Prenuvo, is now paralyzed on his left side and permanently disabled — throwing into high relief that these scans, which prey on people’s fears, aren’t exactly fool proof-despite extravagant claims that they can pick up anything from tumors to brain aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A judge approved for the lawsuit, which was filed in September 2024, to proceed last month, according to &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt;. A statement from Prenuvo to the newspaper stated that “we take any allegation seriously and are committed to addressing it through the appropriate legal process. Our focus remains on delivering safe, high quality, proactive care to the patients who place their trust in us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Full body scans are controversial in the medical field because some doctors think they pick up details that could be false alarms that send patients down a rabbithole of expensive and unnecessary testing, according to &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt; — or, as in Clifford’s case, the scans can miss glaring signs of danger. Most conventional doctors instead use MRIs to focus on one area of the body that’s giving patients trouble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Mirza Rahman, a physician and ex-president of the American College of Preventive Medicine, told &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt; that the problem with these scans is that they give people a “false sense of reassurance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Do the radiologists have sufficient time to carefully look at the bones, the vessels, the organs, and all the other information that is generated by such scans?” Rahman said. “That is a question that needs to be answered.”&lt;/p&gt;

Whether they’re typing shrill all-caps messages, foaming at the mouth with road rage or aggressively punching holes in your drywall, men seem to be angrier than ever. And with a “boys will be boys” cultural mindset that provides a free pass on bad behavior to men well into their final decades, it’s hard to know when, or if, these antics will ever end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Would it make you feel any better to know that there’s not only a possible medical reason, but even an accepted syndrome designation, for this way many men have of interacting with the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe not, but the term “irritable male syndrome”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; does&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; exist, and in the two decades since it was coined, it’s become accepted in medical and psychological circles. While not a clinical diagnosis, experts say it’s an accurate description of a cluster of symptoms that often appears in aging men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Along with the term ‘andropause,’ which refers to male menopause, it’s a useful shorthand for describing what happens to men through gradual testosterone decline and hormonal changes,” said Dr &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.houmanmd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Justin Houman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.houmanmd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Justin Houman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, assistant professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Andreas Kindler via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andreas Kindler via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Gradual testosterone decline can contribute to a number of symptoms, including mood changes, low energy and fatigue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Houman, the most common symptoms are: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mood changes, including irritability, lower motivation and feelings of depression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cognitive changes, like difficulty concentrating or memory lapses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low energy and fatigue that isn’t explained by poor sleep alone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reduced libido and fewer spontaneous erections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Loss of muscle mass and strength despite regular exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased body fat, particularly around the midsection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or poor-quality rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms don’t happen overnight, he said. “Male hormonal decline is gradual, with testosterone levels peaking in the late teens to early 20s, remaining relatively stable through the 30s, and starting to decline by about 1% per year after age 40. Most men start noticing symptoms like those listed above between 40 and 60, though lifestyle, chronic illness and genetics can accelerate or delay onset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “irritable male syndrome” (IMS) was coined in 2001 by Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/138-winter-2020/general-news/gerald-lincoln-1945-2020-a-man-for-all-seasons/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gerald Lincoln" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/138-winter-2020/general-news/gerald-lincoln-1945-2020-a-man-for-all-seasons/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Gerald Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish scientist known for his work in endocrinology and reproductive biology.

While it does usually occur in men later in life, I’ve seen men in their 20s or 30s, who have poor diets, high stress and other factors, can also experience IMS.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We react differently to this syndrome because it’s more likely to “sneak up” on those who have it and those who love them, said coaching psychologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdavis/?originalSubdomain=uk" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="James Davis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdavis/?originalSubdomain=uk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;James Davis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “The hormonal changes of women’s menopause happen in a relatively narrow window of time, but with age-related testosterone decline, it can be more of a ‘slow drip’ rather than a sudden moment. This means symptoms can often be passed off as being caused by aging, stress or a combination of both.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While hormonal changes might jump-start IMS, other factors can play a role, Davis said. “Those hormonal changes make men more anxious, which in turn can lead to irritability. There can be a crisis of self-identity that comes from declining physical performance, loss of muscle and lowered libido. When you overlay the stresses of managing a career, finances and relationships, plus the state of the world in general, you can see that many factors could make a man more irritable. Then add in broken sleep, a lack of experience or framework for expressing vulnerability or issues and increasing social isolation, and you can see how multiple factors can pile up to impact an individual.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One man’s experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/israel.cassol/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Israel Cassol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/israel.cassol/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Israel Cassol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a podcaster who began trying to raise awareness of “male menopause” after he was diagnosed with the condition shortly after turning 40. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/29/influencer-40-wants-acknowledgment-of-male-menopause/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="He told the New York Post" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nypost.com/2021/10/29/influencer-40-wants-acknowledgment-of-male-menopause/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He told the New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; “I was hesitant to share such intimate details of my life, but I needed to know if this was an issue others were facing. I couldn’t believe the response I received from men describing similar symptoms I had suffered from.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These days, he still promotes issues of men’s health, offering this advice to HuffPost: “Men shouldn’t see this as a weakness or something shameful. It’s a natural part of life for many, and talking about it helps break the stigma around men’s emotional health. The sooner we recognize what’s going on, the sooner we can take steps to improve things, and that makes a huge difference not just for men, but for their families and relationships, too.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspect you may have IMS? Here’s what to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diamond said that the first step should be a doctor’s appointment: “I’d say that any man over 45 who is experiencing these symptoms consistently should see their doctor for a blood test to check testosterone levels.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happens if those levels &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; low? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are effective lifestyle adjustments men can make to boost levels naturally, and there is also the option of testosterone replacement therapy, which is something that requires careful consideration,” Davis said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What to do if a loved one seems like a likely candidate for IMS? Besides that medical evaluation, Diamond mentioned, Houman suggested encouraging healthy lifestyle changes like more balanced nutrition, regular exercise, good sleep hygiene and reduced stress. “Keep communication open and non-judgmental, and seek counseling if a relationship strain develops,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to demonstrate compassion for this issue, Davis explained. “You need to realize that this isn’t a personality change per se, but is likely a result of hormonal changes that affect behavior, emotion, cognition and even how that person shows up in the world,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that this is an issue that needs more attention. “We need to bring andropause out into the open so that both men and women can appreciate what’s going on with male hormones and psychology at this time of life. Midlife men are the highest suicide cohort, with a rate almost five times that of women of all ages, so the issue is significant and we shouldn’t marginalize it by questioning its existence or attempting to downplay it,” Davis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cassoll offered this encouragement: “Patience and understanding are very important, because men going through this phase don’t always realize what’s happening to them. It helps if loved ones encourage healthier habits and also create space for honest conversations without judgment. Suggesting a medical check-up can be really helpful, because it reassures the man that he’s not ‘going crazy,’ and that there are ways to feel better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:00:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNUlJwQmtGOXEwc1hwOG9iWXJwazEtam11RzRMeDcwcVBpUE1VTE5Ca2hOT0tFWERlWHNnMDdNVGdkVHFDMnhmWXBZVnJRUjJOQU9aRmgyOXVHb2ZKRjNDcld1STd5TTZQV3EzTnBKcFB6THRqY0taMVljdzdLaHJ0V092OXNQMjBvcWw3bm4zVUxVLVVMdWk1WDhQUV9MVWE2eVNSSjNHUHdicGRISEs2Qm9kX215QWpRTzlNdW50alhneElKOUNtWXBUNl9oenBURUptTzFDRdIB3AFBVV95cUxNdlF1QnF6aDBacVZlSHpxVzBNZ3YxOTdQQklkbHBRTHBJVUlZaUs3ZXZTN254ZWQ5eG9yWEs0ckFlWkx3aUpaUElqOXBITkxqQXNyU1Y1WU56X2xTZnNiVXlQVlRFNURJYXZsUFkzMjMtcU9zWDBTajZRSlpueURiRmlmNng5RGdFOUhnZ2hzRXUxVWtwb1RuWllYQ3YxUVllUEQwQUd4c3J3Tm4wa19wTU52dlRwX01wa2xfclFCUzFNV19xRUpiTVMyeGk3d1puUzNGYWo5ckxpVGlI</guid></item><item><title>6分钟的早晨例行公事，使腹部变平，比50岁后的腹部锻炼更好-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/belly-overhang-after-50-morning-routine/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Start this 6-minute routine today to target belly overhang after 50, stay consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Building a healthier waistline after 50 starts with what you do most often, not what you do occasionally. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6378489/" target="_blank"&gt;Morning routines&lt;/a&gt; work because they anchor your day with intention before distractions, stress, or fatigue creep in. When movement becomes automatic, consistency follows, and that’s where real body changes begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat loss, especially &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-for-belly-fat-over-65/" target="_blank"&gt;around the belly&lt;/a&gt;, responds best to process-driven habits. You don’t wake up one morning with a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-core-drills-tighten-midsection-better-than-crunches-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;flatter midsection.&lt;/a&gt; You earn it by stacking small, repeatable actions that improve circulation, wake up dormant muscles, and set your metabolism in motion. A short daily routine outperforms longer workouts that occur only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency matters just as much as exercise selection. The best movements in the world won’t help if they’re skipped. This routine focuses on simple, joint-friendly exercises that reinforce posture, breathing, and total-body tension. When your body learns to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-routine-to-flatten-lower-belly-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;move well&lt;/a&gt; first thing in the morning, it carries that efficiency into the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This five-minute routine delivers quick wins. It elevates your heart rate, fires up your core, and encourages fat-burning activity without stressing your joints. You’ll feel more upright, more energized, and more connected through your midsection before breakfast even hits the table. Here’s exactly how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5-Minute Morning Core and Metabolism Reset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What You Need&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just your bodyweight and a small patch of floor space. No equipment required. The entire routine takes five minutes from start to finish and works best first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Routine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing March with Core Brace (40 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bodyweight Squat to Reach (40 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incline Plank Shoulder Taps (40 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 20 seconds between exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the circuit once for a total of five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Directions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move through each exercise for 40 seconds, then rest for 20 seconds before transitioning to the next movement. Focus on controlled breathing and smooth transitions. Complete the full circuit twice. Read on for the detailed instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="standing-march-with-core-brace" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing March with Core Brace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movement wakes up your deep core muscles while gently elevating your heart rate. Marching challenges balance and coordination, which forces your abs to stabilize your pelvis and spine with every step. It also encourages better posture, which helps flatten the appearance of belly overhang throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Do It:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brace your core as if you’re tightening a wide belt around your waist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee to hip height while keeping your torso upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the foot under control and switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue alternating at a steady pace while breathing smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Variations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="bodyweight-squat-to-reach" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Squat to Reach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ujNy4KGkMnQ?si=tmBgrcrG09Yr47p2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercise trains your legs, glutes, and core together, boosting calorie burn and reinforcing full-body coordination. The overhead reach encourages thoracic mobility and lengthens the front of the body, helping counter the slouched posture that can make belly overhang more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Do It:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit your hips back into a comfortable squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to stand up tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach both arms overhead as you fully extend your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset and repeat with controlled tempo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Variations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chair-assisted squat to reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarter squat with a slower reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="incline-plank-shoulder-taps" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incline Plank Shoulder Taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incline planks reduce strain while still challenging your core, shoulders, and hips. Shoulder taps add anti-rotation demand, forcing your abs to work harder to keep your body steady. This helps strengthen the muscles that pull the waist inward and support better trunk control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Do It:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on a bench, bed, or sturdy surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back into a straight-body plank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brace your core and squeeze your glutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap one shoulder with the opposite hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate sides while minimizing hip movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Variations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flattening belly overhang takes patience and daily commitment, but the payoff compounds quickly. This routine works best when paired with smart lifestyle choices that support fat loss and recovery.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anchor the habit:&lt;/b&gt; Perform this routine at the same time every morning to lock in consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breathe with intention:&lt;/b&gt; Slow nasal breathing during the workout improves core activation and stress control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize protein:&lt;/b&gt; Adequate protein intake supports muscle maintenance and metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay upright throughout the day: Walking and standing reinforce&lt;/b&gt; the posture benefits of this routine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Track progress weekly:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on how you feel, how your clothes fit, and your energy levels rather than daily scale changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes won’t feel dramatic in the moment, but done daily, it becomes a powerful tool for reshaping your waistline and reclaiming control over your body after 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What endocrinologists deal with is disorders of either a lack of hormones, or too much of a hormone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hormones impact almost all bodily functions, from skin, to the gut, to our moods. “During an average day, the hormones in our body will vary depending on what time it is and what we’re doing,” he says. “For example, have we recently had something to eat or are we hungry? Are we having a stressful day or a calm and quiet day?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Metabolic rate refers to metabolism, which describes how the body uses different components from the foods that we eat and turns those into all the various things that it needs to fuel the body, build proteins and other essential molecules,” says Dr David Cavan, a consultant endocrinologist specialising in diabetes and weight management at University Hospitals Dorset and the London Diabetes Centre, and author of&lt;a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/dr-david-cavan/a-guide-to-weight-loss-injections/9781035430420/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; A Guide to Weight Loss Injections&lt;/a&gt;, published on 29 January. “If you have a very slow metabolic rate, then you will use up less energy and gain weight more than if you have a faster metabolic rate, in which case you’re burning the energy up more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Insulin regulates glucose metabolism and levels of sugar in the blood,” Cavan continues, “but if we have too much insulin in our body, it can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Critically, because insulin is a fat storage hormone, high levels of insulin actually slow down the metabolic rate, and you get into a vicious cycle. The slower your metabolic rate, the less energy you use [and] the more you can store.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to Cavan, it is no surprise that the huge increase in obesity, type 2 diabetes and related conditions in the last 30 years has happened at the time that our food environment has been transformed by ultra processed foods high in energy, sugar and refined carbohydrates – leading to elevated insulin levels. Matters are made worse by the reduced physical activity characteristic of modern lifestyles – which means that while we consume more energy, we use up less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-rely-on-weight-loss-jabs-alone" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Don’t rely on weight loss jabs alone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Weight loss injections influence the levels of hormones that affect metabolism in a number of ways, says Cavan: “They slow down the rate at which food is absorbed from the gut, and affect the brain and satiety. The net effect is that insulin levels will begin to come down and help people to lose the excess fat that they are storing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At present, “they are very restricted on the NHS, so most people are buying them privately through online pharmacies”, says Cavan. “Some people seem to get quite a lot of support, others get none at all. I would encourage people, if they are buying them online, to make sure that they’ve got access to good quality information about how to increase the dose and manage side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="up-your-protein" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Up your protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="baabfaea-1b8d-41e5-966b-194908b1c388" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Eggs are ‘a natural fast food.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; GMVozd/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you have metabolic syndrome – which is characterised by being overweight, and brings an increased risk of pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and sleep apnoea, the underlying problem is too much insulin,” says Cavan. “The trouble is, every time you eat carbohydrates, whether it is sugar or starch, it increases insulin. Moving away from carbohydrates is tackling the root cause and is so important. That is why I encourage my patients to base their meals on protein and vegetables first and foremost, rather than carbohydrates.” Cavan suggests a focus on natural or minimally processed proteins including meats, fish, cheese, pulses, tofu, plain Greek yoghurt and eggs. “So many people are still under the impression that eggs are unhealthy, even though it is more than 20 years since the advice changed,” he says. “Eggs are very nutritious, high in protein, contain almost zero carbohydrates and are very filling. It is a natural fast food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Anjali Amin, an endocrinologist at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, has researched the effect of protein on appetite regulation and says that a high protein diet may be helpful in the control of our appetites: “It is not going to boost metabolism but, from an appetite and energy perspective, it is the macronutrient that makes people feel most full.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="get-lifting" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Get lifting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is not just about what you put into your body – it is what you do with all that energy you are consuming,” says Amin, which is why exercise, especially resistance training, is advisable to improve muscle mass. This is helpful once women enter menopause, she explains. “Their levels of oestrogen decline which impacts bone health. Resistance training helps strengthen muscle and bone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Very simple strength training to maintain your muscle bulk is helpful,” agrees Cavan, “and that can be as simple as doing some squats or press ups.” This is “particularly important for people on weight loss injections, because we know that about &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/lack-of-support-for-people-on-weight-loss-drugs-leaves-them-vulnerable-to-nutritional-deficiencies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;40% of the weight lost is muscle&lt;/a&gt;”. Exercise isn’t the route to weight loss itself though, as Cavan explains: “I say to people, ‘If you want to lose weight, then exercise does not do it. Focus on what you eat,’” which many of his patients find surprising. There are some caveats: “I encourage people to walk as much as they can, because moving does burn off more energy than if you’re sitting down.” If people are very overweight, there is a real risk of injury through exercise, and it can also increase appetite, Cavan adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="work-in-an-inefficient-office" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Work in an inefficient office&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Studies have shown that if we sit down for longer than an hour, our metabolism goes into a sort of ‘sleep mode’ to conserve energy, like a computer,” says Cavan. “I encourage people not to sit down for longer than an hour: get up, move around. If you work in an office, make it as inefficient as possible, so you’ve got to get up or walk to the other side. Literally any excuse to get on your feet can really help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="80176153-0282-46b7-8eb9-46d2ef4cb3f8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Resistance training can help improve muscle mass.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; skynesher/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="sort-out-stress" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Sort out stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dealing with stress plays an important role in managing weight. “Cortisol is the body’s stress hormone and it has metabolic effects,” says Cavan, “not least on pushing up your glucose and insulin levels, so it worsens metabolic health. Any type of stress can increase cortisol levels, be it emotional or work-related, which adds to metabolic ill-health.” Stress can also lead to comfort eating, he says: “It drives hunger and we can crave sugar if we are stressed. Poor sleep adds into that, because when we sleep, cortisol levels naturally go right down, which is key to a healthy metabolism. But if your sleep is disturbed, or if you’re not sleeping, they stay up, promoting poor metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="prioritise-sleep" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Prioritise sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Circadian rhythm is fundamentally tied to the regulation of energy metabolism,” says Ray. “People often don’t realise how much sleep is necessary for adults: between seven and nine hours a night. If you consider yourself, or ask your friends if they are getting seven to nine hours sleep a night, you’ll find that at least 50% won’t be. This is an immediate, highly prevalent cause of poor health and can lead to an increased risk of disease. If you’re not sleeping well, and you’re very tired during the day, that affects the kind of food you choose to eat and how full you feel after eating, which can lead to weight gain that further disturbs sleep. The heavier you are, the worse you sleep, and there are hormonal consequences that flow from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all know the consequences of trying to live against our circadian clock,” Ray continues. “If you’ve ever had jetlag or worked a night shift, do you remember how horribly disruptive it is on how you’re thinking, your appetite, what you want to eat and when you want to eat? About &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/articles/thenighttimeeconomyuk/2022" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in five&lt;/a&gt; in the UK work some form of shift; as in, working outside core work hours – either early starts, late finishes or a night shift. And we know that increases, dramatically, the risks of obesity and diabetes. We can take healthy individuals and deprive them of a good night’s sleep for between one and three nights, and we see that their energy metabolism drastically shifts very much closer to the metabolism we see in people with type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exercising early, in natural light, can have a positive impact on circadian rhythm. “Try to ensure that you get enough physical exercise, ideally in external light,” says Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6acd88ae-7c9e-414f-aade-c1fd4a8a64d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Use hormone tech cautiously.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: SimpleImages/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="dine-early" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Dine early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If your body is busy digesting food, it is going to be difficult for it to get into sleep mode, so eating late at night is not a good idea,” says Cavan. “There are also metabolic health benefits to time-restricted eating, by having a prolonged fast overnight. That is a very effective way of pushing your insulin levels down low,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which helps burn off excess fat. You don’t need to go for days without eating. But try to have your evening meal as early in the evening as possible, no later than 7pm, and you can go into a fasting state before going to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="watch-out-for-signs-of-an-imbalance" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Watch out for signs of an imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Amin says to look out for “unexplained changes” that could be the sign of a hormonal issue: “Persistent fatigue, weight changes without trying, heat or cold intolerance, irregular periods, difficulties getting pregnant or sexual dysfunction, hair loss or unusual hair growth. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which may indicate there is a problem with the hormone insulin, can often present with thirst or excessive urination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treatment can initially focus on lifestyle. “Type 2 diabetes can respond well to diet and lifestyle interventions; ensuring a healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise, may have an impact on the hormone insulin,” says Amin. Other treatments include hormone replacement therapy but there are also medications that modify hormone action rather than replacing it – and very occasionally, there are surgical interventions for some hormonal conditions, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="use-hormone-tech-cautiously" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Use hormone tech cautiously&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There has been a rise in home testing tech related to hormones – but how useful is this? “It is great that it increases awareness of hormonal conditions,” says Amin, “but I think it has the potential to oversimplify a very complex system, and you can take things out of context. I use wearable technologies such as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;glucose monitors a lot with my patients who have diabetes, and they are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helpful to understand the changes in glucose that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients get on a daily basis. But in somebody who does not have diabetes, they actually haven’t been shown to have any scientific benefit. In fact,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they could promote unnecessary health anxiety and you can end up restricting foods that might actually be quite good for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxPZFdQU0hGTldnMnJxN1h1YlpXNHZDcy14QzZFZXhCLVNQZHpZemJCcWcyb2ZuMzFGOWlzeDl3RzU4V3NuM01ycmRfd0o1OC1DT2NNdXpBLXhzc21LdW4xbktxSmRTeU1jLWlPUnZOb2otQU1paUl4WUs1cU1hUXFpZEFsbVBjUlQ5OERoYWNtQWN2aFUxZEhVUWNMaGtEcVJPc0tmWi1KRXhjQ0RJaF9QZDVkNV9HU0JwRDVSblc4azFKWC1FVHQxam1CVQ</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬遇见她的第一个雪人太可爱了，说不出话来- PetHelpful</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-meeting-her-first-snowman</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5Na3dDaTZWY2s3TUlJUUZ4cXo4Wmh6T1Q4M1VrUDBKdi14azJ4UzV1aUxaTEx6b0xLbTFTc3RYRm03QWFuaV9ES3hUNFIyU2VlWkd4TDdKR19IZ3FlcUZuMjNhNFlpNlRacDktSEV1aGlWMkM2QklCZ0xMUlhKZXc</guid></item><item><title>科学家进行全面审查，展示冷水疗法的健康益处- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/comprehensive-study-cold-water-therapy-temporary-fix-or-long-term-health-benefits/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, cold water therapy has captured the imagination of wellness enthusiasts, athletes, and researchers alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From icy plunges in natural bodies of water to brisk cold showers at home, this practice has gained traction as a potential tool for improving health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond the hype and anecdotal claims lies a question: does cold water immersion truly &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wim-hof-method-helps-fight-stress-inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deliver on its promises&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; (UniSA) set out to answer this by conducting the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a nuanced perspective, shedding light on both the benefits and limitations of this increasingly popular practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-of-cold-water-therapy"&gt;Impact of cold water therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 11 studies involving 3,177 participants, examining how cold water immersion influences stress levels, sleep quality, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results suggest that cold water immersion may have positive effects, they also reveal that these benefits are often short-lived and highly context-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cold water immersion has been extensively researched and used in sporting contexts to help athletes recover, but despite its growing popularity among health and wellbeing circles, little is known about its effects on the general population,” explained UniSA researcher Tara Cain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-term-stress-relief"&gt;Short-term stress relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key findings of the study was that cold water immersion could reduce stress levels – but only temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants experienced lower &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-eats-away-our-brains-cognitive-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; for approximately 12 hours after exposure. Interestingly, those who incorporated cold showers into their routines reported slight improvements in their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These showers lasted anywhere from 20 to 90 seconds, suggesting that even brief exposure to cold water might have some positive effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers noted that these benefits tended to fade after three months, indicating that consistency might be key to sustaining any gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another intriguing discovery was the impact of regular cold showers on sickness-related absences. One study included in the analysis found that participants who took cold showers regularly experienced a 29% reduction in days missed due to illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this finding is promising, it raises further questions about the mechanisms behind such outcomes and whether they apply universally or only to specific groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found some links to cold water immersion and better sleep outcomes, but the data was restricted to males, so its broader application is limited,” noted Cain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-science-behind-cold-water-therapy"&gt;Science behind cold water therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold water immersion involves submerging the body in water with temperatures typically ranging from 50-59 degrees Fahrenheit (10-15 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, data was included only if participants were immersed at or above chest level for a minimum of 30 seconds. Practices like cold showers, ice baths, and cold plunges were all included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ben Singh highlighted an unexpected aspect of the findings: cold water immersion causes a temporary increase in inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At first glance this seems contradictory, as we know that ice baths are regularly used by elite athletes to reduce inflammation and muscle soreness after exercise,” said Dr. Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the initial spike in inflammation is not necessarily harmful. Instead, it represents the body’s response to cold as a stressor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like exercise causes short-term muscle damage before leading to stronger muscles, this inflammatory response may help the body adapt and recover over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight could explain why athletes continue to use cold water therapy despite the temporary rise in inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-approach-with-caution"&gt;Approach with caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study suggests potential benefits, it also highlights the need for caution, particularly among individuals with pre-existing health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temporary increase in inflammation, though beneficial in certain contexts, could pose risks for those with chronic illnesses or other medical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing this, people with pre-existing health conditions should take extra care if participating in cold water immersion experiences as the initial inflammation could have detrimental health impacts,” noted Dr. Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research emphasizes the importance of understanding one’s own body and health status before diving into cold water practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday wellness seekers, the findings serve as a reminder that what works for one person may not work for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are an elite athlete or everyday wellness seeker – it’s important to understand the effects of what you put your body through,” said Cain. This personalized approach is crucial when considering any health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising findings, the study also revealed significant gaps in our understanding of cold water immersion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, while there are many claims that it can boost immunity and mood, the evidence supporting these assertions remains weak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that more high-quality, long-term studies are needed to determine who benefits most and what the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breathing-less-oxygen-could-extend-your-lifespan-by-50-or-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ideal approach&lt;/a&gt; might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, there isn’t enough high-quality research to say exactly who benefits most or what the ideal approach is to cold water immersion,” said Cain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current data is limited in scope, focusing primarily on specific populations and short-term outcomes. Expanding research to include more diverse groups and longer observation periods will be essential to uncovering the full potential of this practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies could provide clearer guidance on how to incorporate cold-water immersion into daily life effectively and safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-water-therapy-and-human-health"&gt;Cold water therapy and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those intrigued by the idea of cold water therapy, the study offers valuable insights but also calls for a measured approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the practice shows promise in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/embracing-stress-mindset-is-actually-a-good-thing-for-athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt;, improving sleep, and enhancing quality of life, these effects are often fleeting and vary from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating cold showers or other forms of cold water exposure into a routine might yield some benefits, but consistency and individual tolerance are key factors to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, cold water therapy is not a magic solution but rather one piece of the larger puzzle of health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research continues to evolve, individuals are encouraged to listen to their bodies and consult healthcare professionals when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an athlete seeking recovery strategies or someone exploring ways to enhance your daily wellness, understanding the science and limitations of cold water immersion can help you make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:32:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPQXVvRXF0MmxDV2VhbzB5N09HR1MxbmNhNTMyY1lJZVFweGNhbVBQMFo0Z2k2ZTYtZENQaXFtMkZNLUxWZ2UxY0s0S3JwTGcza0dsVUFudlA1ZU5qVnVKSjRDRjRsdjJDSldNU250V1pOWXRVS1FSWDh6WVFZTXlWajEwMzV4TEk1dFIxdHBBUnlkbTQ4NjNiT3hKSmFzZnQ4RVBrQXBsTUxGbzhMa0E</guid></item><item><title>我的研究帮助发明了Ozempic —然后男性科学家获得了所有荣誉-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/they-took-my-patent-the-scientist-wiped-from-the-ozempic-story-hvxwc5m3x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A Yugoslavian researcher leant over the stainless steel table, watching her colleague work. Fourteen years after she had arrived in America, Svetlana Mojsov was close to the breakthrough she had dreamt of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Gingerly the technician placed the pancreas in a small wooden chamber, warmed to exactly 37C — body temperature. Then, with practised precision, she flooded it with a new chemical cocktail that Mojsov had prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They were at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, working in the lab of Gordon Weir, one of America’s foremost authorities on the hormones that govern&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; the body. He rang Mojsov with the results shortly afterwards — and they were beyond anything she had imagined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I still remember clearly the excitement,” Mojsov says today in her office in New York, where she is research associate professor at the Rockefeller University. The hope was that Mojsov’s mixture would coax the rat’s pancreas into doing what diabetes prevented it from doing in the body: releasing insulin when blood sugar rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Weir called to tell me that insulin levels were dramatically increased at very low concentrations [of the mixture]. That effect was not seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mojsov thought that success might open the way to a powerful new treatment for diabetes. Four decades later it has turned out to be much more important than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/off-scales-inside-story-ozempic-race-cure-obesity-aimee-donnellan-review-krqc66rgt" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The inside story of how Ozempic conquered the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The mixture that she had conjured up — known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) — is now the secret sauce in weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Together these drugs are changing the world one injectable jab at a time. In the UK about 1.6 million people are now taking them. Their manufacturers believe their popularity will eventually be double or triple that. They can help users shed almost a quarter of their body weight. They treat or prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Dozens of studies are under way to discover if they can also address everything from dementia and polycystic ovary syndrome to skin conditions such as psoriasis and chronic inflammation. In other trials, scientists are investigating whether these drugs might treat addictions such as smoking, alcohol and gambling — in lab rats, the medications have reduced cravings for cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mojsov herself is now working full time, at 78, on how artificial intelligence can help figure out new uses for GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All of this can be traced back to that day in a Boston laboratory in 1986. After watching the experiment Mojsov returned to her own much smaller lab at Massachusetts General Hospital — Mass General — where she worked, and began to write up her findings. Months earlier she had consulted her mentor, Bruce Merrifield. “I told him about my experiments,” she recalls. “He listened and then told me to go out and buy a stack of hardback notebooks and document everything carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.9"&gt;&lt;div id="dc842cc3-bacc-49f0-8462-8b5d459467e8"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Svetlana Mojsov with fellow students and her mentor, Bruce Merrifield, at Rockefeller University c 978&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;COURTESY OF SVETLANA MOJSOV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Merrifield, a titan in his own field of chemistry who had just won a Nobel prize for developing a faster way to synthesise proteins, knew that in the scramble for scientific glory, the battles are not only fought in laboratories. Mojsov had no idea how valuable his advice would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The experiment that she had just been central to was meticulously written up, peer-reviewed and ultimately published by one of the top scientific journals in the world, with Mojsov as the first named author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Even so, over the subsequent decades her involvement would be slowly wiped from the record. Three men — two of whom she worked with — would go on to win the most prestigious prizes in biomedical science for their work on GLP-1, while she was relegated to nothing more than a footnote in the story. Svetlana Mojsov would need to prove herself all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In 1972 a 25-year-old graduate of Belgrade University stepped off a plane from Europe into the busy arrivals hall of JFK airport in New York City. Short and slim, with hair cut into a bob that framed piercing and inquisitive blue eyes, Mojsov was looking for a chance to leave her mark on science. As her taxi crossed the Queensboro Bridge, the imposing steel structure carrying multiple levels of cars over the East River into Manhattan, she was amazed by its scale. The dark grey concrete skyscrapers and the bleak, dirty streets that she found on the far bank impressed her less but faded from view once she reached the leafy campus of the Rockefeller University, a private graduate university for biomedical research on the Upper East Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Obesity was not yet on the radar of American doctors and nurses but she and her PhD classmates at Rockefeller learnt that the university’s hospital was conducting metabolic studies on severely overweight patients. “I thought that these people were an exception and not something we were going to see in the future,” she says now. Yet to Mojsov, who had grown up eating modest portions of Balkan staples such as spinach pie and goulash, the signs that Americans were already consuming vast amounts of unhealthy food were obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I remember seeing all the pastrami and the big cheeseburgers,” she recalls. “I had never seen a steak before, let alone the giant steaks with potatoes. It was huge. The meals were huge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although it was widely believed at the time that obesity was solely due to a lack of willpower, some researchers were beginning to uncover more nuanced causes of severe weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A scientist named Doug Coleman had sutured two mice together, one obese and one thin, so they could share the same blood supply. After a few weeks the overweight mouse started losing weight, which led Coleman to suggest in 1973 that there was “a satiety factor” in the blood of the thin mouse that the obese one couldn’t make. “It was that experiment that showed there must be some factor that causes obesity,” Mojsov says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In 1983 she moved to Boston with her husband, Michel, an immunologist who had a residency at Mass General. The huge complex, which includes a world-renowned diabetes centre, is the largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and was intensely hierarchical. Harvard-trained physicians ruled. PhDs such as Mojsov were near the bottom. She was hired to create proteins for the other scientists in the building but quickly secured a senior research position that gave her some funding and therefore independence. “It was clear from the very beginning I would have my own project,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She soon heard of Joel Habener, a balding and bespectacled endocrinologist, who worked two floors down from her. He was already a star. One year before, Habener and his team had identified a long chain of amino acids in fish that resembled glucagon. This proved to be a hormone involved in regulating blood sugar: GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/what-happens-when-you-stop-fat-jabs-bzx5lpsnp" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when you stop fat jabs? The scientist who knows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mojsov became fascinated by the body’s different ways of working with blood sugar and spent months chemically synthesising GLP-1 and then tracking down its origins using antibodies. Word of her activities reached Habener’s lab. But rather than venture down to a relatively unknown chemist’s domain, he sent Daniel Drucker, a Canadian postdoctoral researcher working in his lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mojsov was wary of Drucker. On the surface he seemed pleasant — a young, energetic and handsome medic with soft brown eyes that creased at the edges when his smile would break out mid-speech. But as she listened to his proposal to join forces, it seemed transactional. “I couldn’t put my finger on it,” she says. “He looked entitled. But I was collaborative and I was discovering this new peptide and I was interested in what he was doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Habener himself became friendlier. He would drop into Mojsov’s lab every few weeks seeking some of the GLP-1 she had synthesised for his own experiments. The two men, along with other members of Habener’s lab, began using her ingredients and techniques to track different forms of GLP-1 in rat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In September 1986 Habener and Mojsov published a joint paper. It detailed the discovery of GLP-1 in the gut, and Mojsov identified its active form. She is listed as first author on that paper and Habener is last, as is typical for the senior author on a paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This was really a foundational paper,” she says. “It has it all. It is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.30"&gt;&lt;div id="6b582f10-1229-4cb7-9578-8969b6292845"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Medications such as Mounjaro mimic GLP-1, which Mojsov discovered while she was at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Endocrinologists agree with her assessment and consider this paper to be a watershed moment in the discovery of GLP-1 drugs. The timing was critical. It was published in the same month Jens Juul Holst from the University of Copenhagen presented the same findings at a conference in Rome. The transatlantic rivalry intensified as the two teams sought a much larger prize: to be the first to show that GLP-1 could treat diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Within a few months Mojsov teamed up with Weir for the landmark experiment with the rat pancreas that showed that GLP-1 controlled insulin levels. It depended on their shared expertise and that of Habener. Without his early research Mojsov would not have known about GLP-1, but without her subsequent mixing of the ingredients the breakthrough would have never been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“That was a very critical experiment,” Mojsov says. “It shows how pure I got the GLP-1 to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The paper that detailed their findings was published in 1987 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation. Mojsov was listed as the first author, Weir was second and Habener last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Meanwhile, in the same building, Drucker, the smooth Canadian, and another postdoctoral researcher called Jacques Philippe were working on different experiments but hoping for the same outcome. Habener had instructed Drucker to try to figure out how GLP-1 works. Mojsov didn’t realise it at the time, but this project was in competition with her own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Like Mojsov, the duo found that one version of GLP-1 stimulates more insulin than a longer version of the peptides. Drucker’s paper was published in May 1987, three months after Mojsov and Weir’s. Mojsov was happy to help Drucker because they both worked for Mass General. Up until that point it all seemed relatively collegiate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On a sunny day in May 1993, at the first international symposium on GLP-1, Mojsov ran into Habener walking on the lawn of the Vilvorde Conference Centre just north of Copenhagen. By then she was back at Rockefeller but she still wondered why Mass General had never applied for patent protection of GLP-1. After exchanging greetings, she asked Habener about patents. He just turned around and walked away. It was a bizarre, awkward interaction. Although the two scientists had never been friends, they had collaborated closely at a very important time in both of their careers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eventually Mojsov put the pieces of the puzzle together. In 1996 a colleague on a separate project mentioned that Mass General had been granted patents for the discovery of GLP-1 in 1992, the year before she bumped into Habener. He was listed as its sole inventor. Without telling her, Habener had then applied for a separate patent using some of Mojsov’s research in 1993, a little over six months after he had bumped into her in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“When I found out I was shocked,” she says. “I hadn’t looked for the patents but I had always thought I would be on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She found a patent lawyer who looked through her notebooks and told her that he expected Mass General to roll over relatively easily and admit that a mistake had been made. A letter was fired off to the hospital. There was no response for a year, so Mojsov’s lawyer sent another letter. “I was really surprised and my lawyers were really surprised why Mass General ignored us,” Mojsov says. “It just went on and on.” Then Mass General hired an elite intellectual property law firm from Washington. They asked to interview Mojsov about her role in the GLP-1 discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Much was at stake. The patent holder would receive a significant percentage of royalties from any GLP-1 drugs, not to mention the fame associated with inventing a novel and powerful drug. At this stage the Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk had already bought the licensing rights for GLP-1 in 1992 from Habener. The company was actively seeking to create the world’s first diabetes drug, building on Mojsov’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I was advised to be very careful,” Mojsov says. “I needed to prove my contribution but not discredit Habener, or the patents could be in jeopardy — and that could have undermined Novo Nordisk’s efforts to make a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The legal exchanges grew heated between Mojsov and Mass General’s lawyers. “I don’t remember crying because there was so much anger,” she says. “I had to calm myself down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then, out of the blue in 2006, the hospital agreed to amend five patents to include Mojsov as a co-inventor. For this Mojsov had to concede a lot of ground. “At first I insisted that we had to have half and half,” Mojsov says. “But my lawyer told me I had to compromise.” In the end she was awarded a third of drug royalties. Habener received the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It wasn’t much money anyway. By the time Novo Nordisk’s first GLP-1 drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010, there was only a year left on the patent. But Mojsov had been vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She thought back to the advice her mentor, Bruce Merrifield, gave her about the notebooks. “He told me to keep the dates. It was very helpful. That’s how I finally got the patent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The fight was far from over, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.49"&gt;&lt;div id="235f5b03-eca3-402d-b4bd-3a40a19b2eff"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;From left: Daniel Drucker, Svetlana Mojsov, Jens Juul Holst and the molecular geneticist Jeffrey Friedman at the Princess of Asturias awards, Spain, 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Habener, Drucker and Holst all agree that Mojsov made an important contribution to the GLP-1 discovery. Habener says he told Mass General that she also deserved to be on the patents. Still, none of these men has gone to great lengths to ensure that the scientific community knows the extent of her involvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In 2021 the three men shared the Canada Gairdner International award, often seen as a precursor to a Nobel prize, for their work on GLP-1. The Gairdner was the third award in four years that they won for research that began in the 1980s. A week after the ceremony, Mojsov read a follow-up article about their work in Cell, a top academic journal. It was littered with inaccuracies. It incorrectly described Habener as the sole inventor of GLP-1. It wrongly described her as a junior member of his laboratory. There was no mention of Mojsov being a co-inventor on multiple patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I felt like this was becoming a pattern,” she says now. “One of the ways to diminish my work was to say I was a postdoctorate of Joel Habener because, in the Harvard Medical School hierarchy, medical doctors [such as Habener] are always above postdocs who have a PHD and are always at the lower level. I was aware of it but I didn’t pay attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So on a crisp sheet of paper Mojsov hand-wrote a letter of complaint to the editor of Cell, correcting the errors in the article one by one. She received an apology and the article was amended. It was a small but vital victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As the Gairdner award indicated, the impact of GLP-1 puts its discoverers on course to win a Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. But the prize rules mean that the accolade can be split only three ways at most. So unless Mojsov can establish her claim, she will be left out of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to earn the highest accolade in her field. The correction in Cell marked the first moment that the wider scientific community embraced the true significance of her work. It also led to further supportive coverage in the science press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/tim-spector-nutrition-weight-loss-jabs-ozempic-hdm72xc5v" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tim Spector: Weight-loss jabs are fine… if we stop eating junk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Finally, in September 2024, Mojsov received heavyweight public recognition for her role in the discovery of GLP-1. Along with Habener and Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a medicinal chemist at Novo Nordisk, she won the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research award, America’s top prize in biomedical research. The honour suggests that if and when the Nobel committee recognises the scientists who blazed a trial towards the Ozempic age, there is a good chance that Svetlana Mojsov will be one of the three on the podium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Habener called to congratulate her. The “short and cordial conversation” was the first time that they had spoken in more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Lasker-DeBakey ceremony, a modest lunch of chicken and salad, was held at New York’s Pierre Hotel. Mojsov was accompanied by her husband, son and daughter. She stood up and made a brief speech, explaining what an honour it was to receive the award, thanking her mentor, Bruce Merrifield, and emphasising the importance of collaboration in science. Habener was sitting three seats to her right. She didn’t mention him once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When she sat down, her son leant over and whispered in her ear, “You did it, Mum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Off the Scales: The Inside Story of Ozempic and the Race to Cure Obesity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; by Aimee Donnellan (Fourth Estate £20).

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have confirmed in the largest study of its kind that bacteria, not fungi, are the major culprit in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome"&gt;auto-brewery syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a rare medical condition where people become intoxicated after eating, despite not consuming any alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing stool samples from 22 patients diagnosed with ABS, and their unaffected &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;household partners&lt;/a&gt;, researchers identified two common bacterial species that are more abundant in people with the syndrome, reinforcing the findings of a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brewing-bacteria-found-in-a-man-s-gut-could-solve-a-fatty-liver-disease-mystery"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of auto-brewery syndrome are rarely diagnosed, and there is no consensus on how to treat the condition, so even though the study is small, it represents a meaningful number of patients who have been rigorously tested for ABS – and whose gut bacteria produced high levels of ethanol when cultured in lab experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-rare-syndrome-causes-the-human-body-to-brew-alcohol"&gt;Mysterious, Rare Syndrome Causes The Human Body to 'Brew' Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many patients will visit multiple medical centers only to be dismissed as surreptitious drinkers and leave without a diagnosis," the team, led by infectious disease expert Elizabeth Hohmann of Massachusetts General Hospital and gastroenterologist Bernd Schnabl of the University of California San Diego, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surging levels of ethanol in their bodies often cause liver damage, not to mention serious social, family, and legal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/ColorizedSEMKlebsiellaPneumoniae-642x672.jpg" alt="Two-rod shaped bacteria, end to end.

She referred the callers to Schnabl, who began recruiting patients for a follow-up study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing gut microbes from ABS patients to those of people they live with, the new study effectively controlled for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/daycares-in-finland-grew-forests-and-it-changed-kids-immune-systems"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;dietary factors&lt;/a&gt; known to influence gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnabl and colleagues found that bacterial cultures from patients experiencing 'flare-ups' – symptoms of intoxication – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation"&gt;produced more ethanol&lt;/a&gt; than microbes from those in remission or from household members unaffected by the condition.

The man remained in remission for more than 16 months after the second dose, and his family says his normal behavior has "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;essentially returned&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest relief for ABS patients might lie in promoting or introducing, through dietary changes, stool transplants or probiotics, other strains of gut bacteria that readily metabolise ethanol. Although Schnabl &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-some-people-get-drunk-their-own-gut-bacteria"&gt;doesn't rule out&lt;/a&gt; the possibility that some cases of ABS may be caused by fungi or yeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential treatments may also be able to target bacterial genes involved in metabolic pathways that the researchers found were more active during periods of remission, helping to resolve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also notes that ABS patients in this study had "extreme" imbalances in their gut microbiomes&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other studies have reported low levels of ethanol production in patients with diabetes and implicated ethanol-producing gut microbes in fatty liver disease, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2023.04.036"&gt;most common liver disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; globally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This raises a broader question of how prevalent gut microbial ethanol production is in the general population and how widespread the pathological implications could be," Schnabl and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition, our study highlights the importance of the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites to human health," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the &lt;strong&gt;USS Stein&lt;/strong&gt;, a U.S. Navy frigate, returned to port with sonar equipment mysteriously shredded during a routine voyage off the coast of California. What the crew found in the ship’s damaged sonar dome baffled even marine scientists, an enigma that still fuels speculation nearly fifty years later. As first recounted in an interview archived by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Naval Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, the incident has become one of the most intriguing encounters between man and the unknown deep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Attack That Left Sailors Speechless&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;USS Stein&lt;/strong&gt; was on its maiden voyage when its sonar systems suddenly went offline, forcing the ship back to San Diego for emergency inspection. Upon entering dry dock, Petty Officer &lt;strong&gt;Ira Carpenter&lt;/strong&gt; was assigned to examine the sonar dome, expecting a mechanical fault. Instead, he discovered deep slashes along the rubber coating, marks unlike anything he had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d never seen anything like this before, and this type of damage was brand new to me,” Carpenter said in an old interview shared by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2638767529558771&amp;amp;t=30" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Naval Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “I used my knife to pick out this foreign object out of the […] coating, and it looked to me like a claw,” he added. “I quipped to my SW Officer, at the time: ‘Look here, it looks like we’ve been attacked by a bunch of small alligators.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cuts were jagged and embedded with tiny organic fragments, resembling hooks or barbs. The crew had no rational explanation for the bizarre damage. The notion that a giant sea creature had physically attacked a military warship seemed almost impossible, and yet, the evidence suggested precisely that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Scientist Who Faced The Unexplainable&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make sense of the event, the Navy consulted &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Forrest Glenn Wood&lt;/strong&gt;, a marine biologist experienced in deep-sea species. After careful analysis, Wood concluded that the strange hooks could belong to a massive squid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squids do have claws similar to this. Nothing else that is known in the ocean has structures of this kind,” Wood commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding was extraordinary, suggesting that a &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/deep-sea-squid-shows-off-disguise/" data-type="post" data-id="99307"&gt;colossal squid&lt;/a&gt;, a creature typically confined to Antarctic waters, might have ventured thousands of miles north into warmer seas. “This doesn’t rule out something that we haven’t found yet,” Wood added cautiously, leaving open the possibility that an unknown species could have been responsible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His remarks, preserved by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Naval Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, sparked decades of debate among naval historians, oceanographers, and cryptozoologists. If true, the USS Stein incident represented the first known case of a deep-sea predator physically damaging modern naval equipment and surviving to tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Legend That Lingers Beneath The Waves&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To this day, no one has fully explained why a colossal squid, or any creature large enough to attack a warship, would surface near &lt;strong&gt;Southern California&lt;/strong&gt;, far from its natural habitat. Scientists know that colossal squids, &lt;em&gt;Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni&lt;/em&gt;, can reach lengths of over 23 feet and weigh more than 1,000 pounds. Their tentacles are lined with rotating hooks designed to grip prey, or perhaps, unwittingly, a U.S. frigate’s sonar dome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that only deepens the mystery. The colossal squid is known to dwell in the frigid depths of the Southern Ocean, not in subtropical waters. Was this a lost or dying specimen that strayed into warmer regions? Or did it represent something entirely different, an undocumented species living far closer to human civilization than we imagine?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even today, the USS Stein incident is cited as evidence that the ocean still conceals creatures beyond our comprehension. While scientists remain skeptical, the story stands as a reminder that for all our technological advancement, the deep sea remains the planet’s last great frontier, and perhaps, its most unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beneath The Surface Of A Cold Case&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half a century later, the USS Stein’s encounter endures as a maritime legend. The ship was repaired, its sonar restored, and the story quietly archived, but the questions it raised never truly sank. The fragments found embedded in the damaged dome disappeared into Navy files, fueling rumors of secrecy and classified research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who believe the world’s oceans still hold ancient mysteries, the Stein case is a symbol of our ignorance, proof that &lt;strong&gt;Earth’s largest ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; continues to surprise even the most advanced fleets. Whether it was a known giant squid or a yet-undiscovered creature, one thing is certain: something powerful enough to rip military sonar equipment apart lurked just beneath the waves that day in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
