			&lt;p&gt;A recent study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the study identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading scientists to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn"&gt;Microplastics Found Deep Inside Human Bones, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant.

			&lt;p&gt;The bumpy trajectory of human aging may have a tipping point as we enter our twilight years, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past the age of around 75, our bodies can no longer easily recover from injury or illness – a sharp decline in resilience that comes with a corresponding rise in the risk of dying, according to researchers at Dalhousie University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model looks at aging as a balance between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dying-cells-play-a-vital-unexpected-role-in-healing-study-shows"&gt;damage and repair&lt;/a&gt;, with the breakdown of that balance marking the point of no return into frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could help researchers and clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/standing-on-one-leg-can-reveal-a-huge-amount-about-your-health"&gt;better understand&lt;/a&gt; and plan for people's health care needs as they approach this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;Study Reveals The Surprising Age at Which Your Brain Reaches Its Peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We find that natural aging dynamics are non-trivial and include a tipping point near age 75 where robustness and resilience become insufficient and after which individuals tend towards worse health over time, marking an end to a robust and resilient youthful period," writes a team led by physicist Glen Pridham of Dalhousie University, in a preprint available on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several recent studies have revealed, the course of human aging isn't as smooth as you might think. Rather, the human body appears to undergo periods of accelerated aging while we're alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study into the molecular changes associated with aging, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;humans experience two drastic lurches forward&lt;/a&gt;, one at the average age of 44, and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, research also suggests there's at least one turning point during life when organ aging accelerates. A study published this year found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;this turning point occurs at age 50&lt;/a&gt;, after which your tissues and organs age more rapidly than the decades preceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter our twilight years, there's no denying that health problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;become more serious&lt;/a&gt;, both in their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased vulnerability and susceptibility to health setbacks is clinically referred to as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cger.2010.08.009"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors often use a tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/older-people-in-hospital/frailty/identifying-frailty"&gt;Frailty Index&lt;/a&gt;, based on the number of health deficits a patient has, to predict that patient's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg" alt="Graph showing trajectories of normal and accelerated aging where people become increasingly frail." class="wp-image-181856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging-600x453.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Research is revealing that &lt;span&gt;aging isn't a steady process, as depicted here, but one with accelerations and tipping points. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302593532_Cardiac_Senescence_Heart_Failure_and_Frailty_A_Triangle_in_Elderly_People"&gt;Shinmura, &lt;em&gt;The Keio Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pridham and his colleagues used the Frailty Index in a different way: to construct a new mathematical model of human aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they needed a robust dataset. They used data from the University of Michigan &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/"&gt;English Longitudinal Study of Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, which have tracked the health of thousands of people over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Scientists Reveal Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From those surveys, the researchers included data on 12,920 individuals who visited medical facilities 65,261 times between them, with a median age of 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They quantified each participant's health using a Frailty Index comprising more than 30 attributes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-way-to-slow-chronic-illness-in-old-age"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, difficulties performing tasks and activities, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they built a mathematical model to analyze changes over time in two key health areas: adverse health events, such as illness or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-biomaterial-could-finally-repair-damaged-cartilage-in-injured-joints"&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt;, and the time it takes for participants to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-in-hospital-appears-to-speed-up-patient-recovery"&gt;recover from them&lt;/a&gt;, using the Frailty Index as a measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Frailty Index rose, it meant the participant was experiencing more health setbacks and recovering from them less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, they found that both health setbacks and recovery time increased with age, until the participant reached a tipping point at which the recovery rate could no longer keep up with the rate of health setbacks. The age range for this tipping point was about 73 to 76 years for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the Frailty Index and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;the researchers write in their preprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate, leading to death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not exactly cheery, but the good news is that this information could help soften or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;mitigate the effects&lt;/a&gt; of this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg" alt="Illustration of a grey-haired man with walking stick standing in front of a bed with a window to the right." class="wp-image-181858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls can lead to sharp declines in overall health, but they are preventable.

Multiple members also told ABC News the council has not met this year, raising questions about its ability to carry out its advisory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the letter, members warn that “Although progress has been made, the United States continues to experience over 30,000 new HIV cases every year. Without continued investment, progress toward ending the HIV epidemic will stall, cases will increase again, and the health of Americans will suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They point to the bipartisan Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, launched in 2019, which helped drive a 12% drop in new infections. Fully funding the program, the council says, could save up to $100 billion in health care costs by 2030. But members say House proposals would eliminate funding for domestic and global HIV efforts, cut more than $1 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and remove key parts of the Ryan White Program, which supports people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “PACHA is a largely symbolic body whose members are engaging in another useless PR exercise that has no connection to the Trump administration’s robust work to tackle HIV and AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HHS is strengthening efforts to end the HIV epidemic by advancing next-generation HIV prevention and treatment options, strengthening viral suppression nationwide via HRSA’s Ryan White program, supporting emergency preparedness, and expanding access to trusted HIV information,” Desai added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, who has treated patients since 1986, the prospect of losing momentum feels painfully familiar, despite modern preventive tools that didn’t exist in those early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another PACHA member, Tori Cooper, said the stakes are not abstract but matters of life and death for the communities she serves. A longtime HIV advocate, she works as director of community engagement for the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Transgender Justice Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We know that when people have HIV and it goes untreated, they die, and often they die horrible, painful deaths,” Cooper said. “And I'm not just talking about people who do ‘dirty things’ or ‘nasty things.’ I'm talking about people who perhaps were born living with HIV, or people who got it and didn't even know that they had it, or didn't know that their partners had it, folks who have been in monogamous relationships for years, it's all kinds of folks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cooper said she fears a rise in preventable illness if people cannot reach clinics or afford care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Because people aren't able to get tested to confirm an HIV diagnosis, that means they're not getting the care that they need to get to an undetectable viral load,” she said. “If they have detectable viral loads, then it makes it easier to pass HIV along to their sexual partners or during childbirth or through accidents or injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Philip Chan, an HIV physician in Rhode Island who drafted the first version of the letter, echoed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HIV is not a partisan issue,” Chan said. “HIV, similar to many other infectious diseases, does not discriminate based on, sex, religion, political party, it is important that we keep up our efforts to address this otherwise, more people will continue to be infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chan noted that Ending the HIV Epidemic began under the Trump administration with the goal of ending new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. He said progress could be lost without continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, the quilt remains a reminder of the lives her generation lost, but she believes the country still has an opportunity to avoid repeating the past. She points to the bipartisan legacy of HIV policy, from early federal HIV bills to PEPFAR to the Ryan White Program, as proof that the United States can protect its progress if it chooses to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;“We have the tools to stop new HIV infections and keep people who are already positive healthy,” she said. “We can end the HIV epidemic, but only if we continue the federal support that made these gains possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNN1ZsOHFTY2ItQ3h1R1ZYbU1DaEZFeEVzSEFSUlcxMlZLaFlfVDV5RFhETHFrYWdHV1luSkh5VmpxeU1zeDcwb1JZX0UyaHV6ekpVOV85aWhnSXFoVXliMXhJNDhwRXhXVU9XbE83S283ZkZZMkR3VlJDbElpLTBSdUpGWWZ1dmxyRjc4WVl3NkRoOEFON3RtbTViU2k5emZldjVZLTJMWW5ScFFfTkE1VtIBtgFBVV95cUxPRlFlcWx4dzI0WDlUc0VKUGE2TGpaVzdlQVFwTlF0WnB3NW9Bejhjc3REdUxwMTF1RnBvekxuZnAtTlZtdkR1bGwySDNfYVNCSDdVMnNOcTBSVDdCV1hETWlVWmw1Y0NHUXFGTEluMVFuZE5HMGxoemFMNDAtRFJmNUhKUjcxVXZxeFN6VHF3MHFEak5DaE45WnBQYTJpQ29hVl9mZjhWSVBCbUV5eEdWZC1Nd3FBZw</guid></item><item><title>为什么唱歌对你的健康有惊人的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251128-how-singing-can-improve-your-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Singing also activates a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/hbm.21173" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;broad network of neurons on both sides of our brain&lt;/a&gt;, causing regions that deal with language, movement and emotion to light up.

Some anthropologists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-017-9607-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that our hominid ancestors sang before they could speak, using vocalisations to mimic the sounds of nature or express feelings. This may have played a key role in the development of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150221" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;complex social dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2023.2197977" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;emotional expression and ritual&lt;/a&gt;, and Street points out that it's no accident that singing is part of every human's life, whether musically inclined or not, noting that our brains and bodies are attuned from birth to respond in positive ways to song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Lullabies are sung to children, and then songs are sung at funerals," he says. "We learn our times tables through chanting, and our ABCs through the rhythmic and melodic structure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Come together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not all types of singing are equally beneficial.

They include men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and prison inmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In each case, offering services specifically designed around those groups’ needs has borne fruit – for example, LGBTQ+ friendly walk-in clinics can mean access to care for people who are stay away from public clinics due to the stigma around HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of those clinics and other outreach services have closed, along with swathes of community-led organisations, previously reliant on donor funding.

Yet, despite popping supplements religiously, many people still find their vitamin D levels stubbornly low. Sounds familiar? You’re not alone. A lot of us start taking vitamin D tablets or weekly sachets without really understanding what affects absorption, when to take it, or what lifestyle factors could be blocking results. So if your reports still show deficiency even after months of supplements, doctors say there are some crucial details you might be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Shovana Veshnavi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Principal Consultant- Internal Medicine, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Consultant- Gastroenterology &amp;amp; Hepatology, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Faridabad; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Senior Consultant- Gastroenterology, Medanta Hospital Noida to shed light on why some people continue to lack this essential vitamin in their body even after taking pills and supplements regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is considered an &lt;keyword id="31185279" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="optimal-range-of-vitamin-D" source="Orion"&gt;optimal range of vitamin D&lt;/keyword&gt; for different age groups?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, balance is everything, too little weakens bones and immunity, and too much can actually be harmful. Experts say knowing your ideal range can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that for overall health, the sweet spot for 25(OH)D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels is usually between 30–50 ng/ml for most age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing similar views, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says older adults need a little more support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reminds that infants and pregnant women should monitor their levels closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala suggests 40–65/70 ng/ml for athletes, pregnant women, and elders with osteoporosis. He cautions that levels above 100 ng/ml risk toxicity, and 150 ng/ml is clinically dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Calcium &amp;amp; Vitamin D Deficiency in India: Bridging the Nutritional Absorption Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Many people take Vitamin D supplements regularly but still show low levels. What are the most common reasons behind this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping Vitamin D supplements faithfully and your reports still show low levels—don’t worry, you’re not alone. Experts say there are several hidden reasons why Vitamin D doesn’t always rise the way we expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that low Vitamin D often persists because of inadequate or inconsistent dosing, or because people take Vitamin D without dietary fat, which is essential for absorption. She also highlights that obesity can trap Vitamin D in fat tissues, making less available for the body to use. Conditions like intestinal disorders, genetic differences, and medications such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids can all interfere with Vitamin D metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that even regular supplementation can fail if there are absorption problems, organ-related issues like kidney or liver disease, poor dosing, or low-quality supplements. Timing and consistency matter more than many people realize, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala points out that many people take only 1,000 IU per day, which may simply not be enough for them. He stresses that Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so taking it on an empty stomach reduces absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do nutrients like magnesium, Vitamin K2, and calcium interact with Vitamin D, and why are they important for absorption and function?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, it doesn’t work alone, it teams up with a few key nutrients to actually do its job well. If you’re low on any of those, Vitamin D may not activate properly, no matter how much you supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala says that magnesium is a major cofactor in Vitamin D activation in the liver and kidneys, and without it, Vitamin D stays inactive. Vitamin K2 helps prevent vascular calcification by directing calcium to the right place, and adequate calcium intake is crucial because Vitamin D and calcium are partners in bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Signs you are having too much Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that magnesium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin K2 function as a team—magnesium activates Vitamin D, Vitamin K2 ensures calcium goes to the bones (not arteries), and calcium needs Vitamin D to be absorbed and built into bone. When all three are aligned, bone health improves and Vitamin D works more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can gut health or digestive issues affect Vitamin D absorption? If so, how can individuals improve this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vitamin D is absorbed in the small intestine, anything that interferes with digestion can interfere with absorption too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that gut issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, IBS, SIBO, chronic pancreatitis, or fatty liver can significantly reduce Vitamin D absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that conditions like chronic diarrhoea, inflammatory gut diseases, or previous intestinal surgeries can severely impair the body’s ability to absorb Vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that Vitamin D absorption requires proper fat digestion. In diseases of the small intestine, pancreatic insufficiency, cholestatic liver disease, obstructive jaundice, or after bariatric surgery, absorption drops sharply. To improve it, he advises taking Vitamin D with the day’s largest fatty meal, ensuring enough magnesium, eating whole grains, fruits, and fermented foods, and addressing malabsorption medically when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lifestyle—such as screen time, indoor living, and sunscreen use—impact Vitamin D synthesis from sunlight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most of us spend more time under roofs and behind screens than under the sun, and experts say that shift has dramatically affected natural Vitamin D production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency: Doctor explains causes,  symptoms and prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that indoor living and excessive screen time have reduced how much UVB exposure our body gets during the day. UVB is the wavelength the skin needs to make Vitamin D, but it cannot penetrate glass, meaning sitting by a sunny window doesn’t count. She adds that sunscreen can block up to 95% of Vitamin D synthesis, and air pollution also filters UVB rays, making sunlight even less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing on the impact of modern habits, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra recommends 10–30 minutes of direct sunlight exposure, three to four times a week, to help restore levels naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that air pollution is a major factor in preventing UVB rays from reaching the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line? Step outside more often, catch some gentle sunlight, and let your body do what it’s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there certain medical conditions or medications that interfere with Vitamin D levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that certain medical conditions and long-term treatments can prevent the body from absorbing, storing, or activating Vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that a range of medications—like anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, rifampicin, antiretrovirals, antifungals, and long-term PPIs (acid-reducing drugs)—can either speed up the breakdown of Vitamin D or interfere with fat absorption, which is essential for Vitamin D utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that kidney disease, liver disease, and obesity commonly disrupt Vitamin D storage and activation. Some medicines, including steroids, anticonvulsants, and cholestyramine, can further reduce absorption, meaning levels stay low even with consistent supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala highlights that conditions like hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption disorders can all interfere with Vitamin D status. He notes that anti-epileptic medications, tuberculosis drugs such as rifampicin, steroids, and HIV medications may also significantly lower Vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What form of Vitamin D supplement (D2 vs D3) is most effective, and how should it ideally be taken, timing, dosing, with or without food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to boosting Vitamin D levels effectively, not all forms, and not all dosing habits, are created equal. Experts agree that Vitamin D3 is the superior choice for raising and maintaining healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that Vitamin D3 is more effective than Vitamin D2 in elevating Vitamin D levels and sustaining them over time. To get the best results, she recommends taking D3 with a high-fat meal and preferably in the morning or afternoon. She adds that daily or weekly dosing works far better than extremely high monthly doses, and combining D3 with Magnesium and Vitamin K2 helps maintain balance and long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala adds that weekly D3 dosing is commonly preferred and more stable than taking a huge monthly dose. For people with malabsorption issues, he suggests considering calcifediol (25-hydroxy D), which can be more effective than regular cholecalciferol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) stays active longer in the body compared to D2. While timing isn’t critical, taking it at the same time each day is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What symptoms should people watch for if they suspect Vitamin D deficiency despite supplementation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping vitamin D supplements regularly but still feel drained and achy, you’re definitely not alone. According to Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi, persistent fatigue, muscle or bone pain, low stamina, hair loss, recurrent infections, low mood, sleep disturbances, chronic back pain, stress fractures, or slow recovery after surgery could all be red flags that your vitamin D levels are still low. Women may even notice menstrual irregularities as a sign of deficiency. If symptoms continue despite supplementation, she says there might be underlying issues like poor absorption or incorrect dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala stresses that supplements alone aren’t magic—daily lifestyle habits matter too. Safe sun exposure, strength training, weight-bearing exercises, and a nutrient-rich diet make a big difference. Think fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, nuts, legumes, greens, fermented foods and cheese—foods rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that continuing symptoms like low immunity, frequent infections, and mood changes may indicate that the body still isn’t absorbing vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apart from supplements, what everyday practices or foods can naturally support better Vitamin D utilisation and overall bone and immune health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting the most out of your vitamin D supplements, lifestyle plays a bigger role than most people realize. Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala explains that improving gut health is key because a healthy gut supports better nutrient absorption—including vitamin D. He also strongly advises cutting down on smoking and heavy alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi highlights the power of safe sunlight exposure, particularly on the arms and legs, as one of the most natural and effective ways to boost vitamin D levels.

She points out that lifestyle habits such as adequate sleep, stress management, strengthening exercises, maintaining a healthy waistline, including omega-3s, eating fermented foods, and prioritizing gut health all improve how effectively the body uses vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 05:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxQVHhrNGxNNlVHRXAtV0RWdXBSdjVNSjVGZkRtbXhaVTlJUjRoM2JHZGFOV2lOX3ltSFdrQnU4NHFpQ29Ubmt5cFpSUXFuZmdqWG5hcm5ubVVjMkRvWTFjdk9pd01iRnNSVFFvNnF0N0tycmw4RVF3dXRYRnh0bExUYXlLeHNIWDBNaUUtZVZndXNoWkdXeEhMWURHNTRxNU9lcW5rc0pVcGhyR2l2ZFhYZnM4R0F3c3I5ZG5wVmVUdXNZbW40dDVsSE1YbXR6d2NSQVdnWS1GcnlVY0l0cXduMUpqSko4VXVDQThkbjUtNTh4S2JMcXBrbVUtd0RmcUxuMGxweHF6bmFDZGVJUERyOFRB</guid></item><item><title>澳大利亚药物监管机构对包括Ozempic在内的减肥药物发出心理健康警告--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/01/mental-health-warning-issued-for-weight-loss-drugs-including-ozempic-in-australia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The medicines regulator has added two new safety warnings about mental health and contraception for people taking high-profile diabetes and weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there is no proof of a causal association, experts say the risks are significant enough that awareness is important as part of a precautionary approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) says that because suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported with these relatively new GLP-1 receptor agonists, doctors should “monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviours, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The warning of the potential risk of suicidal thoughts applies across the GLP-1 RA class of medicines (often called semaglutides), including Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda, Trulicity and Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;amp;CMP=emailbutton" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sign up: AU Breaking News email&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2822453?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=082024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the World Health Organization’s global database of adverse reactions and found reports of suicidal thoughts were slightly higher than expected for semaglutide, even when compared to other diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following this international signal (an adverse event that is potentially caused by a medicine that warrants further investigation), the TGA asked its Advisory Committee on Medicines for independent expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found there was not enough evidence for causality, but noted there was a complex interplay between mental illness and chronic endocrine disorders for which GLP-1 RAs may be used for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search of the TGA’s database of adverse event notifications for the GLP-1 RA class up to September found there were 72 reports for suicidal ideation, six reports for depressional suicide, four reports of suicide attempt, two reports of completed suicide and one report of self-injurious ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on semaglutide prescriptions on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme show there were &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/are-we-at-a-watershed-moment-for-weight-loss-drugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than two million in 2023-24&lt;/a&gt;, but there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/16/ozempic-can-cost-almost-2000-a-year-australias-peak-medical-body-says-it-should-be-on-the-pbs-for-weight-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;even more users whose use wasn’t subsidised.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Terri-Lynne South, the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ specific interest group for obesity management, said: “We do think there might be a subgroup of patients who may be more vulnerable to a worsening of their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the moment, that seems to be people who might already have a past or current history of depression or anxiety or on a antidepressant type medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery have also shown that significant or rapid weight loss can be a “real triggering event from a mental health point of view,” South said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The TGA has also issued a separate warning around Mounjaro and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After investigating the potential reduced effectiveness of oral contraception when first taking or increasing the dose of Mounjaro, the TGA said it could not rule out an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a precautionary measure, it has updated the product warnings for Mounjaro to include further advice for patients using oral contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive or add a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the medicine and for four weeks after each increase in the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It added that none of the GLP-1 RA class of medicine should be used during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said since Mounjaro had been available in Australia, the product information had mentioned potential concerns around the delay in gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What that means is [the drug] delays the food and everything else that you eat actually coming through the digestive system, and therefore having an impact on the absorption of the oral contraceptive pill, and therefore possibly the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said the warnings were part of normal post-market surveillance, which meant due to the smaller numbers of people involved in initial drug trials, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/23/two-very-rare-covid-vaccine-side-effects-detected-in-global-study-of-99-million" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some associations can’t be seen until tens of thousands of people&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f"&gt;In every decade, the body goes through changes but this is especially true for women in their 40s. Hormonal shifts can affect metabolic health, bone density and even mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; and perimenopause—the lead up to menopause—can begin at any age, though most people experience it in their 40s and 50s (and some may enter premature menopause in their 20s and 30s). Regardless of when it begins, these changes can affect muscle mass, joint health and overall strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f-2"&gt;Certified personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Stephanie Woods&lt;/a&gt; works with women over 40 to help counter this decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we hit our 40s, the body naturally begins a process called sarcopenia—the loss of muscle mass,” she says. “This decline accelerates with inactivity, leading to decreased strength, slower metabolism, and increased risk of falls and fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;that rebuilding or maintaining muscle through resistance training helps preserve functional movement, improves insulin sensitivity, supports healthy body composition, and even boosts mood and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Simply put: strong muscles are a foundation for long-term health and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve hit your 40s and have never picked up a dumbbell, you’re far from alone. Many people start training later in life or return to exercise after a long break. According to Woods, it’s actually one of the best decades to start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s never too late,” she says. “In your 40s, you’re likely still in good health, but muscle and bone density are starting to decline. This means that small, consistent efforts now can dramatically improve your future quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strength training at this stage not only reverses early muscle loss but also improves joint integrity, metabolism, and hormone balance,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners, she says, can make fast, measurable progress with simple, consistent training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining strength isn’t just about fitness, it’s about independence, vitality and longevity,” says Woods. “Strength training plays a huge role in your healthspan and not just your lifespan,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Woods has chosen three beginner-friendly, equipment-light exercises that lay the foundations for lifelong strength and joint health. She’s also included modifications for those who are still progressing to the full move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-bodyweight-squat" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-bodyweight-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

The box squat variation helps build confidence and strength for lowering deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-push-up" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-push-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

They also help maintain bone density in the arms and spine. For beginners, incline push-ups—with your hands on a countertop, box or bench—make the movement accessible while still building strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="3f8fe7aa-4c83-4431-8c37-45bb5d0c4aa5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on your hands and knees, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or a bench or wall for the incline version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step back so your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your body down by bending at the elbows until your chest comes close to the floor or incline surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push back up to the starting position, keeping your core and buttocks tight and back straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="78dd1bc1-31ab-41f7-a277-a8a9e5a2e6e1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Beginners can start with a wall or countertop push-up and lower the surface height gradually over time as you get stronger and can do it from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-bird-dog" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-bird-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

(Ayata et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two crucial characteristics of this microglia subtype: The cells have lower levels of a protein previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, called PU.1, and a greater expression of a protein called CD28, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.immunol.14.1.233"&gt;a crucial participant&lt;/a&gt; in the wider immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia with this combination were better able to slow down the build-up of amyloid-beta protein clumps in mouse brains, while also limiting aggregations of tau – another potentially toxic protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;associated with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stopped CD28 production in mice, finding that harmful, inflammation-causing microglia became more abundant, and that amyloid-beta plaques became more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found the onset of Alzheimer's tends to happen later in life among individuals with a genetic disposition towards lower PU.1 expression in specific cells, compared to the general average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results provide a mechanistic explanation for why lower PU.1 levels are linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease risk," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25641673/protective-brain-immune-cell-state-discovered"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Alison Goate, from the Icahn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a natural defense against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;Alzheimer's in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but one which clearly isn't powerful enough to fully stop the disease from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that future therapies might be able to increase the levels of this microglia subtype – though we need to make sure microglia work the same way in humans first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;incredibly complex&lt;/a&gt; disease, involving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;a host of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, and so an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; will probably need to take aim at several targets at once. One mechanism researchers might consider for future studies is converting microglia into this neuroprotective mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also adds to our understanding of how Alzheimer's fits in with the immune system as a whole. The modified microglia identified in this study, in mouse brains, act in a similar way to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-discovered-t-cells-could-rid-late-stage-cancer-patients-of-tumors"&gt; T cells&lt;/a&gt; that roam around the rest of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery comes at a time when regulatory T cells have achieved major recognition as master regulators of immunity, highlighting a shared logic of immune regulation across cell types," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/protective-microglia-subtype-offers-potential-new-therapeutic-pathway-in-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;epigeneticist Alexander Tarakhovsky&lt;/span&gt;, from the Rockefeller University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09662-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

confirming she was healthy, she laughed even harder which annoyed her mother&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, the OP lived in a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/art/home-design/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; where her body was constantly under scrutiny. At 140 pounds which was well within a normal range for her age, she was repeatedly called “fat”, especially by her older brother who ironically ate far more and moved far less. This same brother would call her “overweight” and warn her that she was going to develop a heart disease with the way she ate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she received no &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-thing-happened-on-birthday/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt; treats, and often went without lunch or breakfast, her brother got bottomless servings justified by the fact that he was just “a growing boy”. Every time food went missing, from juice to leftovers, she was instantly blamed. It didn’t matter if she was at school all day or simply hadn’t touched it, her family was convinced she was the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she stopped defending herself and would remain quiet, but one day, her brother told their mother he felt sluggish and dehydrated and he was taken to the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/health/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;. A doctor ordered bloodwork, and the results came back with her brother diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The shock was so intense, but the OP couldn’t help laughing at the irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mother, furious that she dared to laugh, dragged her to get blood tests too, but her result came out and she was completely healthy. The OP laughed harder this time which made her &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/ex-gifted-kid-traceable-airpods/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; even more furious, leading her to tell the extended family about how she laughed at her “unfortunate” brother. Now, the whole family was lashing out at her which left her wondering if she was wrong for laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?image_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Am I The Jerk For Laughing When My Brother Was Diagnosed With Diabetes?" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?media_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9705628" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg" alt="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." title="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/coronavirus-sample-procedure_10623631.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=0&amp;amp;uuid=ad6e0faa-7944-43ff-ab80-9a9537449a06&amp;amp;query=teen+boy+doctor+appointment" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;freepik / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situations like the one described in the OP’s case, the family dynamics reflect patterns of scapegoating. According to &lt;a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/family-scapegoat/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Choosing Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, family scapegoating occurs when one person is unfairly blamed for the family’s problems, absorbing criticism and frustration that really belong to the household as a whole or another family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members project their guilt, insecurity, or unresolved emotional issues onto the scapegoated individual, often using manipulative tactics like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/exhausting-relationship-fb-pics/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; or triangulation to reinforce the blame and further isolate the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are often worsened by sibling favoritism. As the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230809-the-lifelong-effects-of-the-favourite-child" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; explains, when one child is consistently favored, the others can feel overlooked, jealous, or inadequate, potentially leading to anxiety or low self-esteem. Meanwhile, the favored child may face pressure or develop a sense of entitlement, straining family bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounding these issues is a family culture that emphasizes blame over communication. Life coach &lt;a href="https://www.melissalloyd.org/unraveling-family-dysfunction-the-role-of-poor-communication/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Melissa Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; notes that families operating this way often fall into cycles of conflict and emotional distance as frequent victim-blaming, sarcastic assumptions, and top-down authority stifle open dialogue and prevent healthy problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netizens were firmly on the OP’s side, emphasizing that she wasn’t wrong for laughing and pointing out the clear irony of the situation. They agreed that her laughter wasn’t cruelty but a reaction to the poetic justice on display. They encouraged her to protect her mental and physical health, warning that her environment could become increasingly toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about this situation? Do you think laughing in a moment of irony makes someone a jerk, or was it justified here? We would love to know your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Netizens insisted the author’s laughter was at the irony and that she wasn’t wrong for that given the way she had always been treated by her family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online discussion about sibling mocking over weight and karma as brother develops diabetes, showing ironic consequences and family dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit user comments mocking brother’s food habits and diabetes as sister laughs at his weight-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment advising to move out and avoid toxic family amid weight and diabetes struggles shared between siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment highlighting karma as a result of sibling mocking over weight and subsequent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on forum discussing brother mocking sister over weight, with karma and diabetes irony mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenter’s perspective on sibling mockery over weight and diabetes, highlighting irony and family conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a Reddit comment expressing concern about skipping meals, related to a story about sibling weight and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment about a brother mocking sister’s weight and the brother developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on a forum about sibling mocking related to weight and diabetes, advising to laugh it off to avoid blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment discussing a brother mocking his sister's weight before developing diabetes himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment about food and weight, related to bro mocking sis and diabetes topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9705084" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9705084" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="19597"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9705084-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

These reasons are not based on mere hearsay, but rather on very valid observations from clinical practice and from the experiences of patients themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decline in Vitamin D levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most influential factors in winter is the reduction of vitamin D, an important modulator of immune function. In winter, shorter days with less direct sun means we synthesize less vitamin D. Specialists recommend checking vitamin D levels twice a year, typically in autumn and spring, so that supplementation can be tailored to keep values in the optimal range for immune stability. For autoimmune patients, maintaining serum vitamin D around 100 to 120 nmol/L helps to create an environment for a more balanced immune response. This is usually not achieved via a standard multivitamin; indeed, targeted dosing may make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Foods that boost immunity before winter sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disrupted melatonin &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hidden culprit is fluctuating melatonin levels. Winter brings reduced sunlight and longer nights, which may affect the circadian rhythm and melatonin production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributing factors include less time outdoors, more indoor sedentary activity, and greater evening exposure to blue light from screens. Evening blue light exposure is particularly problematic, as it suppresses melatonin, an important hormone for both sleep and immune regulation. The specialists in autoimmunity recommend maximizing daylight, minimizing screen time near bedtime, and incorporating into the diet foods that naturally raise melatonin levels, such as pistachios, eggs, mushrooms, and cherries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Increase in viral infections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colder months make people highly susceptible to respiratory and viral infections. Such infections might ignite or act as a triggering factor in autoimmune diseases, potentially leading to flare-ups or even worsening of ongoing inflammation. That would make prevention of infection via hygiene and good lifestyle habits, coupled with vaccination if needed, particularly important for people with compromised immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dietary and lifestyle changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter tends to enhance refined carbohydrate and sugar intake, both well-known to negatively impact gut health. Gut integrity is particularly important in individuals with autoimmunity, and clinicians have noted that diets high in sugar exacerbate inflammation. Additionally, most people with autoimmune disease have some intolerance to gluten and sometimes dairy, so seasonal shifts toward comfort foods can inadvertently trigger symptom flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduced activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point specialists make is that colder weather means less movement and reduced physical activity. Regular exercise is very supportive of immune health and reduces joint stiffness common in autoimmune disorders. As it gets colder, people tend to become more sedentary, missing the benefits of daily stretching, movement, and possibly therapeutic practices like infrared sauna or gentle yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comprehensive Prevention Strategies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists in autoimmune diseases recommend a multi-pronged approach for winters: exposure to sunlight or supplementation of vitamin D, planning regular movement even indoors, monitoring carbohydrate and gluten intake, and maintaining sleep hygiene. Small changes-like walking outdoors during daylight hours, consuming food that helps stimulate melatonin, and regular stretching-can add up and reduce frequency and severity of flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To conclude:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter brings many unique challenges for people living with autoimmune diseases, and understanding why symptoms worsen is itself a kind of empowerment. For many, supplementation of vitamin D deficiency, support of natural sleep rhythms, adherence to anti-inflammatory diet, and regular physical activity bring about much-improved stability and resilience during the season. It goes to prove that with insight and a host of preventive strategies, seasonal setbacks are just not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 02:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxQZGVFanRTVlFRNEl5VTFDN29DU0RiaXlKTXBBU3Z6amMtLUpWR2NyUlJVLXpqYkNOTlIyYWU1Qm85cDFIVS1oWC1jZzczWTFKWGtCMGJUaE9oNlBkY2dhZ1pseG1fbmdCQjdtbHNDV0RLMGFDUWNUd3MxdTR5MFB3dnF3ckxaeFk3S1hrazY1TlhWWmhrMXFjZnNIZlhhUkVvNUl4a1Nwa2NCa3NyM2VZTXhaSU9nNUJaT1pIMnplQkdVaFA1dTIzb1FoV0w1eGlacDNNdU5nanJFeGVsSGZJTVBn</guid></item><item><title>心脏病风险较高的南印度人：突破性的基因研究揭示-德干先驱报</title><link>https://www.deccanherald.com/india/south-indians-more-prone-to-heart-disease-study-3815339</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="story-content-7ca60d47-9f3d-4741-a559-7236d133ead0" class="story-cards taboola-read-more-container"&gt;&lt;p class="wW6Na"&gt;Published 30 November 2025, 23:22 IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deccan Herald</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 23:22:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOT0hoeU5lT3dOUmNwYnlROHdDRy1wXzZacGc3SWcwVG45dTg0amQxVXd0X1p5VDFCNlRhRllpeTdJLWtickFCd2l3VDE5SzNpcW1ERUN6eDFTd1VxdnNMRmhmWGI5dVZfZUZrTElzMHY1RHBsTU1sYkJTV1F4MExVRFc0b25ZUm92RjY3bEV0Mlg0ZlJ6</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生解释了为什么在脸上使用Phitkari可能有害-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/dermatologist-explains-why-using-phitkari-on-face-can-be-harmful/articleshow/125679648.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phitkari, or alum, has long been promoted as a simple, inexpensive home remedy for common skin concerns. Its natural astringent and antibacterial properties make it popular as a toner, aftershave and even an anti-acne hack. But despite its traditional reputation, modern dermatology raises important questions about how safe it truly is for facial skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent video, popular dermatologist Dr. Jushya Bhatia Sarin shared how using Alum or phitkari on the face can do more harm than good. Emerging research shows that what seems harmless on the surface may have effects that most people don’t consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Phitkari’s salt structure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jushya highlights that phitkari is a sulphate. is chemically a double sulphate salt, potassium aluminium sulphate, and its structure is what gives it strong astringent and desiccating properties, which means it has a strong dehydrating effect on the skin. Dr Jushya says, “Phitkari dries and stretches the skin, as it dries out water from the surface”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Secrets to anti-ageing: 7 simple daily habits that give us healthy skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phitkari has historically been used as a styptic, i.e., a substance that helps stop minor bleeding from small cuts or shaving nicks. Its strong astringent action causes blood vessels and surface tissues to contract quickly, which is helpful for tiny wounds. Here Dr. Jushya says that phitkari was sold in ancient markets, not to use on the skin or underarms, but to reduce the amount of sweat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This translates that alum’s traditional use for cuts doesn’t translate to safe everyday skincare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;No skin-brightening action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another misconception Dr. Jushya addresses is the belief that alum can lighten spots, pigmentation or tan. Chemically, alum’s formula contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No pigment-reducing properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No ability to influence melanin production&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No pathways that affect skin-brightening mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6152334/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;show that melanin regulation requires ingredients that work on tyrosinase or melanocyte activity, something alum cannot do. This means phitkari cannot fade dark spots, treat hyperpigmentation, or provide any brightening effect, despite widespread social media claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing Dr. Jushya highlights is that physical scrubs, especially those using hard, jagged or coarse particles, can cause microscopic tears or “micro-cuts” in the outermost layer of skin. In controlled studies, repeated rubbing or mechanical abrasion has been shown to damage the skin barrier: an in-vitro study found that mechanical rubbing markedly reduced barrier function, increasing skin permeability to water and other substances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the barrier is compromised like this, the skin becomes more vulnerable to environmental irritants, UV radiation, and infections, all factors that can trigger inflammation or stress responses. These, in turn, may stimulate pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), particularly in medium-to-dark skin types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;In short: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;using harsh scrubs, or rubbing vigorously, can cause tiny skin injuries that weaken the skin’s natural protection. As the skin tries to heal from these repeated micro-traumas, pigment changes (dark spots), sensitivity, dryness or even acne may follow, precisely the opposite of the “glow up” many scrubs promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxQVGRjdW93aVY0bnh1RVQxTVRMX3hhV1plb3l0a3lmUDgyNnNVcndaS0ZjRE1yU1kxdExjRjR5cG5hRWVmMmJiaFhQQUp3dUttSDdtdFZ0Y2xheGRVWlkzZ3lTMldkcnNjVnU4c3NRdml1S3FqTmdsVVlJNjBwOVBYaUdWUFpCbkF6b2xNV25Jdl9HNHlKM3RNcGEtQTR3SEZILVN3LWVscFhuQ05PQlc1R3RuNmpkUGFTQTZPN04wVEd2dElWNnpUbFJSTklEWGpaWXZtUkVSbU9VUXAwdVk0VDRrSTUtS3FRaXVKS0E4WDVtS2hubkJR</guid></item><item><title>健康编辑与年轻人疾病激增的癌症斗争-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15310871/health-editor-cancer-surge-young-people-signs.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panic hit first. Then came the embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After all, I had spent years giving health advice to colleagues, friends and family, convinced I was an expert in so many areas of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet there I was, at my desk as Health Editor at the Daily Mail in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-454e28a0-c942-11f0-9d74-9506a24b12fb"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, being told that I had &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4546d5a0-c942-11f0-9d74-9506a24b12fb"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was especially hard to take because being healthy had become so much a part of my identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I trained in martial arts, worked out religiously, tracked everything I ate and, if I'm honest, bragged constantly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Friends came to me for health advice: &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Should I eat this? Will that give me cancer? What supplements do you take? How do I get abs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, my unusual eating habits were a running office joke: six boiled eggs for lunch, yoghurt parfaits mixed in giant baking bowls, and my infamous popcorn that would stink out the newsroom every afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So getting diagnosed with cancer at 29, when I was seemingly in perfect health, felt not only deeply unfair, but a little like some kind of cosmic payback for being so confident in my own good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To my utter shock, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer at 29 (author pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A forced smile barely hides my nerves as I prepare for my first CT scans, which will reveal if the cancer has spread &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That said, however, the diagnosis didn't come entirely out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day before, after putting it off for months, I'd finally had an ultrasound on an almond-sized lump in my left testicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan was meant to take 30 minutes, but dragged on for an hour and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technician muttered about 'poor visibility' and 'protocol' requiring clear images of every region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now I realize what was really happening: she was taking as many images as possible, knowing - or strongly suspecting - it was cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I didn't get out until 3pm, and assumed I'd hear back in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, at 9.03am exactly, my phone lit up. Most offices open at 9am, I thought, so clearly this was urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I shot out of my chair and raced across the newsroom floor as the person on the phone told me to find a private room and turn my camera on. The doctor needed to speak to me urgently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I propped my phone up in front of me and sat awkwardly as the doctor connected and said, 'I'm so sorry - we're fairly confident you've got cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I trained in martial arts (pictured in my uniform) and worked out multiple times a week - being fit and healthy had become part of my identity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: I wear a sheepish look as I wait to hear what stage the cancer has reached&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she delivered the hammer blow, I felt utterly numb. I was listening to every word, but they weren't registering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was as if she was describing someone else, maybe one of the hundreds of patients I'd written about, but not me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then she added, 'There's good news… and bad news.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bad news: they were confident it was cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the doctor told me that if you had to pick a cancer, this is one of the most treatable forms (which didn't feel very reassuring at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she was right. Testicular cancer has a five-year survival rate above 95 percent - and it doesn't take a health journalist to know how good that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall five-year survival rate for all cancers is roughly 69 percent, but many types which are increasingly common in young people are far deadlier, such as pancreatic (12 percent) and liver (21 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testicular cancer is uniquely treatable for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, the tumors are extraordinarily sensitive to chemotherapy, which can melt away cancer cells even if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it usually strikes men in their 20s or 30s, whose bodies handle aggressive treatment well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In my mind I had prepared to do chemotherapy - after all, the doctor told me there was a 40 percent chance of the disease returning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The joy on my face after learning the cancer was contained to the testicle and I didn't need to have chemo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Removing the testicle is also fairly straightforward - you're in and out of hospital in hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And because lumps appear early, surgeons often remove the entirety of the cancer, reducing the risk of spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, I was told I needed surgery immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After hanging up with my doctor, I was struck by a blizzard of emotions. Looking back, I now recognize it as 10 minutes of sheer panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My eyes filled with tears as visions flashed through my mind of the worst-case scenario: bald, weak, dying young, not fulfilling my ambitions or dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I tried calling my mom, who was at work, and Googled survival statistics, which calmed me a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, strangely, something switched in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I became intensely practical, with absolute focus on the next appointment, scan or blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That focus lasted throughout my fight and I haven't been emotional about my cancer since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lot of that is down to how efficient my treatment plan was. From diagnosis to surgery was less than two weeks - startlingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a Briton whose grandfather had to wait six months to start treatment for stage 3 prostate cancer on the National Health Service, the speed of American healthcare, despite its flaws, felt surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The timing of the cancer was terrible - I'd been due to move apartments. Pictured: I was fresh out of surgery and unable to lift heavy items, so I recruited the help of friends to move a sofa into my new home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When I visited my oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering - a surreal experience, given I'd spent years writing about the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, it was reassuring to be treated so quickly. But the worst part of a cancer diagnosis is one that nobody talks about: when the doctor says 'you have cancer,' you still don't know your chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not until they figure out how big the tumor is, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or organs and exactly what type of cancer it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only then can doctors give an accurate picture of your outlook and the treatment you'll need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My blood tests came back the next day: no tumor markers. A feeling of shattering relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans followed a few days later - chest, abdomen, pelvis - to see if it had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a testament to the speed of the US health system that, later that day, I received the results: negative again. Another hurdle cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only after surgery could they confirm whether it was stage 1 - easily treatable, no chemotherapy required. It was looking good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the negative blood tests, scans and size of the tumor, my doctors had been confident I had a single 'seminoma,' a slow-growing tumor that develops over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they found two tumors: one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma - a far more aggressive type that can spread in weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: A post-surgery thumbs up. The moment I woke from the operation, my years-long back pain was gone. It never returned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When I go out, I now try to stick to a two-drink max rule. The 'alcohol guilt' after cancer has been one of many surprises post-diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also early signs cancer cells had started migrating toward the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tiny cells may have leaked into the blood which can, over time, raise the risk of growing new tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When I visited my oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering - a surreal experience, given I'd spent years writing about the hospital - he told me plainly that with this combination, I had about a 40 percent chance of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To my surprise, despite the risk, my doctors advised against chemotherapy, even though it would reduce the risk to just one to three percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they told me, doctors are now rethinking the old blanket-chemo approach because the treatment is brutal - hospitalizations, infections, sepsis, even a small risk of secondary cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For young, otherwise healthy patients, they said it was sometimes worth playing the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was tempting to just get it over with, to never have to worry about the cancer again, and I'd mentally prepared myself for chemo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I sought a second opinion at Mount Sinai. To my surprise, the oncologist there also recommended surveillance only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With two of the world's top cancer doctors in agreement, I felt I needed to be humble and listen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as vain as it sounds, what unsettled me most was the thought of losing my hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemotherapy used for testicular cancer almost guarantees hair loss - even eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a brutal prospect, though many would feel it's a price worth paying for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I am now closely monitored with blood tests, scans and X-rays every few months. If the cancer returns, I'll need chemo. Pictured: Me at my latest checkup in November 2025 (left) and returning to work in September 2025 (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;My mindset is: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. I now urge all my male friends to check for lumps regularly and stay vigilant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what's the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I am now closely monitored with blood tests, scans and X-rays every few months. If it returns, I'll need chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer also affected my hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My testosterone crashed to the level of a 70-year-old, causing overwhelming fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now inject medication three times a week and feel stronger all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two months off training, I'm back to working out five times per week, including three martial arts sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While I'm eating the same, something curious has happened with my weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I've shot up more than 10lbs in three months without gaining much, if any, new fat - almost certainly the result of my testosterone bouncing back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now drink far less alcohol, and when I do, I stick to a two-drink maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more surprising psychological changes is the guilt I feel after drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing alcohol is a class 1 carcinogen - and that I'm in a critical period where my cancer could return - it just feels reckless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By reading this, you know I haven't kept my cancer a secret. I decided long ago I wanted to be an advocate. My mindset is: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now urge all my male friends to check their testicles regularly and stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Curiously, my weight has shot up 10lbs since returning to work and exercise - almost certainly a result of my testosterone bouncing back &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: On vacation in October 2025, trying to reclaim what I can of the summer I missed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I mentioned embarrassment I felt when I received the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well, the second wave of it hit when I realized my symptoms had been there all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two major health issues I'd battled for years - excruciating back pain and chronic fatigue - were almost certainly caused by the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For two years, I'd suffered pain I attributed to slipped discs and jiu-jitsu. On surgery morning, I could barely walk, yet the moment I woke from surgery, the pain was gone. It never returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now think the tumor caused inflammation that radiated through my pelvis, irritating the nerves around my discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also spent years chronically exhausted, no matter how much I slept. I blamed the move to America, stress and long hours, despite fatigue being one of the most common symptoms of cancer that shows itself before a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet I, the person leading the Daily Mail's coverage of cancers in young people, had somehow missed my own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I initially thought my body had failed me, but perhaps it was my mind that had failed to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testicular cancer appears to be one of those genetic lottery diseases - I was probably born with a defect in the cells that form the testicles, called germ cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are the cells that eventually develop into sperm, but if they go awry during development, they can later turn cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We still don't fully understand what sparks the cancerous change, but we know testicular cancer is rising among young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show its incidence has nearly doubled in the past 40 years in American men aged 20 to 34. It is now the most common form of cancer for men under 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, I urge anyone who notices anything unusual, no matter how small, to get it checked. It could save your life - I'm hoping it's saved mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases appear to be trending up, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt; reported that almost 14% of tests came back positive during the week of Nov. 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the week of Oct. 11, 11% of tests taken ended up being positive, while nearly 7% were positive during the week of July 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epic Research’s &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/data-tracker/communicable-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;communicable disease tracker&lt;/a&gt; shows Wyoming saw a particularly high number of cases between Oct. 19 and Nov. 1, with 33.2 cases per 100,000. Other states hit hard at this time were Oklahoma (27.3 cases per 100,000); Nebraska (30.6 per 100,000); Texas (26.5 cases per 100,000); and Alabama (24.7 cases per 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases also increased around this time last year as well: in the week of Nov. 16, 2024, 10% of tests came back positive. They hit a high of 24.82% in the week of Dec. 28,2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From Aug. 1 through Nov. 13 of this year, there were 153 norovirus outbreaks reported by state health departments that report to NoroSTAT, which works with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, there were 235 norovirus outbreaks in that same time period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-norovirus"&gt;What is norovirus?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, the CDC said, is a “very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea.” It causes acute gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation of the stomach or intestines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, it commonly spreads via contaminated food, water or surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many infections come from closed and crowded environments, such as hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of norovirus can include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps, watery or loose diarrhea, a low grade fever and muscle pain. Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting, the Mayo Clinic said, usually start about 12 to 48 hours after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-avoid-norovirus"&gt;How to avoid norovirus&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent norovirus infections, the Mayo Clinic says to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or preparing food; wash fruits and vegetables; and disinfect contaminated surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you actually end up getting it? Most people end up getting better within one to three days, the CDC said. There isn’t a specific medicine to treat it, and antibiotic drugs won’t help as they fight bacteria, not viruses, the health agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Straight Arrow News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNdzlwLW8tR0daN3o3N0oyNTFKWVNfNUdRS3R1U3kxLWVfM203TzQ1VFlPWmdaV3M4WjFTaVdMZjJMNG0tNTlISEYtWG56VVo2XzdBR1FyYzhxR1dtM1NDaE9Oa2RBV1FtODF2TkRROUNPUmUwaVdyZWtuNWhYTGQwbGpLT2g0dDhYTzc4YV9MVEtabXNX</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生对新的头皮狂热给予侧视-新闻</title><link>https://www.newser.com/story/379332/were-spending-hundreds-to-take-care-of-our-scalps.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A rising beauty trend has Americans massaging their scalps and flocking to high-end head spas—sometimes for hundreds of dollars a session—all in pursuit of healthier hair, even if dermatologists aren't convinced most people need the help, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/style/scalp-care-beauty-trends-2025.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The scalp has emerged as the latest focus of the beauty world, and the trend, fueled by TikTok and other social media, has seen a significant spike in interest: According to market insights company Spate, online searches and posts about "scalp serum" jumped 77% over the past year, while "scalp massagers" and "scalp treatment" also saw notable increases.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Influencers are documenting their intensive scalp routines—sometimes involving hours of massage or the use of expensive serums—and sharing with hundreds of thousands of followers, helping to drive the trend. Many major hair-care brands, from drugstore staples to high-end labels, have launched scalp-focused products. Beyonce's Cecred brand famously sells out of its Restoring Hair &amp;amp; Edge Drops serum; it reportedly moved one bottle every 16 seconds from last November through July.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        While some dermatologists acknowledge that scalp care can improve hair health, they caution that elaborate routines aren't necessary for most people. "If you're not having a problem, there shouldn't be this huge drive to have to get all this stuff to put on your scalp," says Maryanne Senna, director of the Hair Loss Center of Excellence at Lahey Hospital &amp;amp; Medical Center.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Still, the allure of scalp care persists, with head spas—especially those offering microscopic analysis of hair follicles and customized treatments—drawing crowds in cities like New York and Los Angeles. Prices for these treatments range widely, with some sessions costing upward of $300. Even if they're not terribly helpful for most people, it's not likely you'll hurt yourself in any way by getting a scalp massage or similar treatment.

          &lt;h2&gt;The Obesity Epidemic: What Really Happened in the 1980s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've seen the arguments. Seed oils are poison. Sugar is the devil. Fast food destroyed America. The government ruined everything. Or maybe it's all Big Pharma's fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone's got a villain. Everyone's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth? Multiple things broke at once. Around 1980, several massive changes hit simultaneously, and we're still living with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Data Doesn't Lie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1503733/large/obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png?1764524981" title="obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;NHANES surveys&lt;/a&gt; show something remarkable: obesity rates were relatively flat for decades, then suddenly bent upward between 1976–1980. Not a gradual drift—a sharp inflection point. Adult obesity jumped from roughly 15% to over 30% in just two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not normal. That's not genetics. That's environmental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Actually Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Government Picked the Wrong Enemy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/about-dietary-guidelines/history-dietary-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;McGovern Committee&lt;/a&gt; told Americans to slash fat intake to 30% of calories and replace it with carbohydrates. Three years later, the first official Dietary Guidelines made it policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food industry listened. Boy, did they listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, everything was "low-fat." Cookies, yogurt, salad dressing, frozen dinners. But fat makes food taste good, so manufacturers replaced it with something else: sugar. Lots of sugar. And refined starches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? Hyper-processed, hyper-palatable foods that were technically "low-fat" but absolutely terrible for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High-Fructose Corn Syrup Went Supernova&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)03883-7/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;HFCS consumption increased roughly 1,000% between 1970 and 1990&lt;/a&gt;. It was cheap, stable, and sweeter than regular sugar. Food manufacturers dumped it into everything—soda, bread, ketchup, crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total added sugar intake skyrocketed. We didn't peak until around 2000, but the damage was already done by the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Portions Exploded&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/" target="_blank"&gt;USDA data show&lt;/a&gt; average calorie intake rose 200–300 calories per day from the late 1970s to early 2000s. That's an extra meal's worth of energy, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald's didn't introduce Super Size until the 1990s, but portions were already growing throughout the 1980s. Bigger sodas. Bigger burgers. Bigger everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain-based desserts, soft drinks, and fast food drove most of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We Stopped Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift from manual labor to desk jobs accelerated through the 1960s–1980s. More people drove everywhere. Fewer people walked or biked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came home computers and video games. Television watching was already high, but the 1980s added new reasons to sit still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids especially. Recess got shorter. PE programs got cut. Screen time went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Smoking Declined (Yes, This Matters)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult smoking rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/tobacco-use.htm" target="_blank" title=""&gt;dropped from 42% in 1965 to 25% by the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. That's overwhelmingly good news—smoking kills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But quitting typically adds 4–5 kg. At the population level, that contributed roughly 1–2 percentage points to obesity prevalence. Not the main driver, but not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Everything Else&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant eating increased. Ultra-processed foods were engineered to maximize consumption. Sleep patterns changed. Stress increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers point to endocrine disruptors, though evidence for the 1980s timeframe remains speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204371" target="_blank"&gt;Peer-reviewed analyses&lt;/a&gt; attribute roughly 50–70% of the calorie increase to greater intake of refined grains, added sugars, and added fats (mostly seed oils used in processed and restaurant food). The rest comes from reduced physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; seed oils. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; sugar. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the government or &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; fast food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all of it. At once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1980s created a perfect storm: official dietary policy that backfired spectacularly, cheap hyper-palatable processed foods, massive portion increases, and a simultaneous collapse in physical activity. The effect was rapid and population-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what actually happened matters because the simplistic answers—ban seed oils, ban sugar, ban carbs—miss the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food environment changed fundamentally. We made calories cheaper, more available, more rewarding, and easier to overconsume. We built cities around cars instead of walking. We replaced recess with standardized tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing this requires addressing multiple systems simultaneously. Better food policy. Better urban design. Better food labeling. Better education about ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One villain makes for better social media engagement. But multiple causes make for better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1980s broke something. We can't fix it by picking just one scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;

Now emerging scientific evidence is shedding new light on its potential health benefits. A Japanese study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.70888" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggests that eating black cumin seed daily could meaningfully lower cholesterol and even support weight loss, offering a natural route to better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black cumin seed: An age-old spice to lower cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black cumin seed, also known as Nigella sativa or kalonji, has long been valued in Middle Eastern and South Asian households for its warm, peppery bite. But the new research gives its traditional reputation a solid scientific foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, adults who took a small daily dose of black cumin seed powder for eight weeks saw notable improvements in several key markers: LDL, or bad cholesterol, dropped, HDL, or good cholesterol, rose and overall lipid profiles shifted in a healthier direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those in the control group, who made no changes to their diets, saw no improvement at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most intriguing part of the findings is that some participants lost weight during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory tests in the same study showed that black cumin seed extract slowed the formation of fat cells, hinting at an underlying anti-adipogenic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This dual benefit, supporting heart health while helping regulate body fat, is rare for such a simple dietary addition. It is one reason researchers believe black cumin could serve as a functional food in preventing lifestyle-related diseases, including obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use black cumin seed daily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, even a teaspoon of black cumin seed powder a day was enough to produce measurable health benefits. For everyday use, the spice can be taken in several easy forms: mixed into warm water in the morning, stirred into yoghurt or smoothies, added to dal and vegetable dishes or sprinkled over salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The simplest and often recommended option is to take a teaspoon of black cumin seed powder in warm water first thing in the morning. But you can just as easily mix it into yoghurt, smoothies or your daily meals. The key is taking it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Early on, doctors told her that issues like laughter-triggered headaches were nothing to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Chiari malformation, which is a rare condition impacting around 300,000 Americans, or one in 1,000, causes the lower part of the brain to push down into the spinal canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pressure, which disrupts nerves and the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including headaches that worsen with straining, neck pain, balance issues and, in severe cases, coordination or vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Gunnoe, uncovering the cause of her symptoms took more than 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As years went on, she began to experience tingling in her arms and fingers, bouts of nausea, heat intolerance and episodes in which her vision would dim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled one incident at work when she became so dizzy and overwhelmed by heat that she collapsed in a restroom, saying she was 'unable to get up' until her fiancé arrived to take her home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That crisis finally led to a neurology referral and the MRI that revealed a 4mm Chiari malformation. Even then, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/onbrandbyshelli/"&gt;doctors initially said &lt;/a&gt;surgery wasn't needed. But Gunnoe's symptoms kept worsening, as simple movements like bending or standing provoked dizziness or instability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shelli Gunnoe, 26, from South Carolina, was diagnosed with a Chiari malformation after more than a decade of confusing symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A follow-up MRI complicated matters further, as a neurologist suggested her symptoms more closely resembled pseudotumor cerebri, a condition where pressure inside the skull rises abnormally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, along with enlarged brain ventricles (a network of fluid-filled cavities within the brain that produce, contain and circulate cerebrospinal fluid) and her earlier diagnosis of hydrocephalus, (a condition when there is too much fluid in the brain, causing swelling and pressure) hinted at a deeper issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Deep down, I knew something wasn't adding up,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now believe some of her symptoms may trace all the way back to birth. Chiari malformation is usually present at birth (congenital), although symptoms may not appear until childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gunnoe was delivered by emergency C-section because she was breech, 'upright with my head positioned in my mother's rib cage,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She inhaled a large amount of amniotic fluid and initially needed NICU care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although her parents hoped for a routine infancy afterward, she soon required a hip brace for developmental support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also 'extremely irritable and only soothed by being held,' and her parents worried her head looked unusually large. Despite their concerns, a neurologist dismissed the issue at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years later, in 2009, Gunnoe was taken to hospital for chronic migraines. CT and MRI scans revealed mild hydrocephalus, and she was treated with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early on, doctors told Gunnoe that issues like laughter-triggered headaches were nothing to worry about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;That crisis finally led to a neurology referral and the MRI that revealed a 4mm Chiari malformation, pictured here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chiari malformation, which is a rare condition impacting around 300,000 Americans, causes the lower part of the brain to push down into the spinal canal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout childhood and her teen years she fainted often and lived with intense fatigue and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors kept telling me it was my weight,' she said. But after losing 50lbs, the symptoms persisted. In January 2022, immediately after standing up from a bike in a cycling class, she fainted again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms escalated in the years that followed: blurry vision, vertigo, crushing fatigue, and mornings when she felt 'frozen and unable to wake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She described episodes that 'didn't feel normal for someone my age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally received a clear diagnosis of Chiari malformation in November 2024, she felt both 'relieved, but frustrated.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neurologist used a skull model to show how her cerebellar tonsils were being pulled downward into the opening at the base of her skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He explained that mine are pushed down further than they should be, slipping through the opening where the spinal cord runs,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because they're squeezed into a space that's too tight, they press on my spinal cord and disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When that flow is slowed or blocked, she added, 'it irritates the nerves and causes many of the symptoms I've been dealing with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gunnoe was delivered by emergency C-section because she was breech, 'upright with my head positioned in my mother's rib cage,' she explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Throughout childhood and her teen years, Gunnoe fainted often and lived with intense fatigue and headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Gunnoe is being closely monitored while her neurologist determines the best course of action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of my combination of Chiari, hydrocephalus history, enlarged ventricles, and possible pseudotumor, my case is still being evaluated,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting, she manages her symptoms through pacing, careful activity choices and prioritizing rest and hydration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm still very much in the 'watch and wait' stage,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the uncertainty, she tries to live fully. She still experiences dizziness when standing, visual disturbances, sensory overload and difficulty tolerating certain movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple tasks, looking upward, bending down or standing too quickly, can trigger symptoms instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even so, she continues teaching full-time, creates online content and models, and is training, with thoughtful modifications, in hopes of participating in the Hyrox race, a global, indoor fitness competition that combines eight 0.62m runs with eight different functional fitness workout stations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a strange balance,' she said, 'acknowledging the reality of a neurological condition while refusing to let it shrink my goals or identity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her symptoms escalated in the years that followed: blurry vision, vertigo, crushing fatigue, and mornings when she felt 'frozen and unable to wake'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the uncertainty, Gunnoe tries to live fully. She is hopeful of participating in the Hyrox race: a global, indoor fitness competition that combines eight 1km runs with eight different functional fitness workout stations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gunnoe hopes her story encourages others not to ignore their symptoms or allow them to be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Invisible illnesses don't always look dramatic,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People see me lifting weights, teaching, modelling, smiling online, and they don't see the hours I spend navigating dizziness, pressure or exhaustion behind the scenes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wants to speak especially to women who feel overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'You can advocate for yourself.

When we talk about “parasites” in this context, we are mainly referring to intestinal parasites; organisms that live inside the digestive tract. Some parasites feed on nutrients, others irritate the intestinal lining, and some feed on blood and can cause anemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these infections vary widely in severity, the symptoms they cause can be equally diverse and often nonspecific. Still, certain patterns have stronger scientific backing. In a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8AjFD2mM9mc" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, popular health educator Dr. Eric Berg, shared 5 symptoms that may signal the presence of parasites in the body, and two natural remedies that can help get rid of them. Below we explore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How Lifestyle Choices Can Increase Your Risk of Stomach Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How dangerous are parasites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000629.htm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Parasite infections &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;occur when parasites enter the body and begin living, reproducing, or feeding inside you. This usually happens through contaminated food, water, soil, insect bites, poor hygiene, or contact with infected animals/humans. Parasitic infections are not trivial; they can translate into serious health burdens, especially if recurrent or untreated. Parasites can cause damage in multiple ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physically attach to the intestinal wall (or other organs), feed on blood or nutrients, and thereby deprive the host of essential nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some disturb the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8191/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; intestinal lining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and interfere with absorption of nutrients, resulting in malnutrition even if diet is adequate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic infections can trigger inflammation (in gut, liver, bladder, or other organs), cause tissue damage (e.g., scarring, fibrosis, cyst formation), or even lead parasites to migrate to and damage distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In heavy or uncontrolled infestations, especially in people with weak immunity, parasites can cause life‑threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Five warning signs you may have parasites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Unexplained sugar cravings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Berg, unexplained sugar cravings, especially for dairy, is a sign of parasites. Dr. Berg adds, “Parasites love sugar, especially milk sugar. If you crave that, you could have parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Grinding teeth at night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night-time teeth grinding may also be connected to parasitic stress on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can release toxins that irritate the gut–brain axis, triggering restlessness, tension, and involuntary muscle activity during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Itchy skin at night (especially in private parts) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night-time itching around the anal or genital area is one of the classic signs of parasites such as pinworms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites tend to be more active at night, which is why symptoms often intensify when you lie down to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Extreme bloating after eating- despite what you eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience constant bloating or gas regardless of the meal, parasites may be interfering with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of them reside in the small intestine, just below the stomach, where they:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- ferment food, producing gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- cause inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- steal essential nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can leave you feeling overfull, heavy, or distended after even small meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Iron deficient anemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain parasites feed directly on blood or damage the intestinal lining, reducing iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this can lead to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- chronic fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- pale skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- low stamina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Berg emphasizes that parasites can literally “steal your iron,” causing anemia in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How parasites are actually diagnosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitic infections are best confirmed through laboratory testing, since symptoms alone can be misleading and often overlap with other digestive or nutritional problems. The most common method is a stool examination, where a lab looks for parasite eggs, larvae, or cysts under a microscope. In many modern labs, more advanced stool antigen tests and PCR panels are used to detect parasites with higher accuracy. These diagnostic methods allow doctors to pinpoint the exact parasite and offer appropriate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdVBxZ3NVZkhlS0U2M193UVMyZm95NVhCVk5NSzMwYTgzSndYbHJkdVBFWFJOU0tyd1hSN0Zpa3dYRjFTMDRFbnhIRXlpLWYzTkJ4OWEwRWZTX3VwUlo3YzUwYzc3c25DS015QUI0WW8zMEtVSWNHLTNnaDdEQklmVmJXdXozc2NPNndUSEhFb3g3T1ZYWEQ1YjdTMWpKcVBhTllmalhadk1aaWs4T0RFMFN3R2dDWUJ2aWVKQlYwWUYyM3VPckVzb2ltS2JlSk9UaDFFdkI5MnYzZmVwc1pmZ24tcVhyVGJhcF9XMUNBQTliMkhMOFV6Q2pR</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，最佳的镁睡眠类型- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/whats-the-best-type-of-magnesium-for-recovery-and-sleep-1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go hard at the gym, it’s important not to overlook recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/flexibility-longevity-1"&gt;Stretching&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-use-a-foam-roller"&gt;foam rolling&lt;/a&gt;, and hanging out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/sauna-benefits"&gt;sauna&lt;/a&gt; can all help reduce muscle soreness. You’ve probably heard rumblings about &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/magnesium-nutrient-supplements-3"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; helping too. Not only does the micronutrient play a crucial role in muscle function, but it also supports sleep—another key for crushing your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shopping for the right &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-magnesium-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium product&lt;/a&gt; specifically for workout recovery is tricky. Not only are there different types of magnesium, but there are also different modalities. Beyond capsule supplements, different topical magnesium products, including oils, lotions, and sprays &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-03-06/magnesium-supplement-benefits-mocktail-foot-spray"&gt;have multiplied&lt;/a&gt; in the marketplace recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But which is best to help you recover from a workout and, ideally, get a good night’s sleep? We talked to a doctor, pharmacist, and dietitian who have all studied the mineral to get advice on which products work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly does magnesium do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to spend money on a nutritional supplement, it helps to have a basic understanding of how it works. Brace yourself: This micronutrient does a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a run-down of magnesium’s job description, according to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.hnfe.vt.edu/people/faculty/stella-volpe.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.hnfe.vt.edu/people/faculty/stella-volpe.html"}' href="https://www.hnfe.vt.edu/people/faculty/stella-volpe.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Volpe, PhD, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian and professor at Virginia Tech: It helps make protein, supports bone health by activating vitamin D (crucial for calcium absorption), and regulates blood sugar concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not even getting into how it supports muscle recovery and sleep.

Dr. Volpe adds to this, saying that magnesium helps reduce inflammation—another way it supports workout recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for sleep, Dr. Chen explains that magnesium calms the nervous system, priming the body for rest. “It also helps regulate melatonin, the hormone that guides our sleep-wake cycles, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note: all the experts we talked to said that most people get all the magnesium they need through their daily diet. “Generally speaking, people are not deficient in magnesium if they are eating a balanced diet,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6689" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6689"}' href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alexandre Chan, PharmD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of clinical pharmacy at UC Irvine.

"The better you know your body, the better you can make decisions and make these types of swaps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help meet the goal of consuming more fiber and natural products, Dumont recommends eating real fruit instead of drinking fruit juice, which is highly processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/mediterranean-diet-paired-other-lifestyle-changes-slashes-diabetes-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean Diet Paired With Other Lifestyle Changes Slashes Diabetes Risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediterranean Diet Paired With Other Lifestyle Changes Slashes Diabetes Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fruit juice can have some benefits — it has minerals, vitamins and micronutrients, but the bottom line is that it's more processed, and you've eliminated a lot of the fiber that is supposed to go hand in hand with the fruit sugar," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating whole fruits instead of drinking processed fruit juice is a healthier option, the doctor advised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumont added that he does not believe in "villainizing" fruit, as it has been scrutinized for being high in sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of good health in fruit," he said. "It depends on that person's individual metabolism. If someone is so metabolically sick, so &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistant&lt;/a&gt;… even some very healthy fruits can be more than their body can handle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But for most people, and especially earlier on when you're not as metabolically sick, the wonderful thing about fruit is that you're actually packaging all of that sugar up in the fiber."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making this one &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:small swap;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;small swap&lt;/a&gt;, even at a fast-food restaurant, can improve overall health, according to Dumont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than selecting a menu item heavy in carbohydrates, like a breaded chicken sandwich, choosing a chicken salad instead makes for a more well-rounded meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Choose grilled chicken in a salad instead of breaded chicken on a sandwich, a doctor recommended.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended choosing chicken that is grilled rather than fried and breaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You put that on top of some lettuce with a good healthy dressing, and it can actually be extremely healthy eating out on the road at a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food restaurant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food restaurant&lt;/a&gt;," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumont said he's seen many patients lose their fight against chronic disease when treated only &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:with medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;with medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was seeing people get worse and worse, and that was really disheartening for me," he said.

The research indicates that eating a moderate daily amount of peanuts improves blood flow to specific regions of the brain and aids in the retention of verbal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As individuals age, the vascular system in the brain often undergoes changes that can reduce the efficiency of blood flow. This reduction in cerebral blood flow is a known physiological marker associated with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the delivery of oxygen and nutrients is vital for maintaining neuronal health, researchers have focused on identifying modifiable lifestyle factors that can support vascular function. Diet is considered a significant factor in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While peanuts are botanically classified as legumes rather than tree nuts, they share a comparable nutritional profile. They are dense in protein, unsaturated fatty acids, and fiber. The researchers, led by Peter J. Joris and Lucia Kerkhof, initiated this study to investigate whether peanuts specifically could offer neuroprotective benefits similar to those observed with tree nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primary motivation for the trial was the high content of L-arginine found in peanuts. L-arginine is an amino acid that serves as a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide, a molecule essential for relaxing blood vessels and regulating blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study focused on skin-roasted peanuts because the peanut skin is rich in bioactive compounds, including polyphenols like resveratrol, which have antioxidant properties that may further support vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people who suffer from age-related cognitive decline or are diagnosed with dementia is increasing rapidly. Currently, dementia is ranked as the 7th leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization,” said Joris, an associate professor at the Institute of Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism (NUTRIM) at Maastricht University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As researchers studying nutrition and brain health, we are very interested in how the food we consume can support healthy aging. Peanuts are widely consumed, affordable, and nutrient-dense, yet relatively little was known about their specific effects on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Earlier work from our group showed that mixed nuts can improve memory and blood flow in the brain in older adults. Adequate blood flow in the brain is important for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain cells. Without enough oxygen and nutrients, the highly metabolically active brain cannot function properly, and key functions like memory can be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we sought to determine whether peanuts, which are botanically classified as legumes rather than nuts, also exert beneficial effects on brain health,” Joris explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effects of peanut consumption, the investigators designed a randomized, single-blind, controlled crossover trial. This study design allowed each participant to serve as their own control, reducing variability caused by individual differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 31 healthy older adults ranging in age from 60 to 75 years. The participants included both men and women with body mass indexes between 20 and 35 kg/m ². Individuals were excluded if they had a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, peanut allergies, or if they were current smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of two 16-week periods separated by an eight-week washout phase. During the intervention period, participants consumed 60 grams of unsalted, skin-roasted peanuts daily. This portion size is approximately equivalent to two servings or two handfuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peanuts were of the runner variety and were eaten with the skins intact. Participants were instructed to incorporate the peanuts into their regular diet but were not permitted to heat or crush them, as this might alter their nutritional properties. During the control period, participants refrained from eating peanuts and avoided other nut-based products to ensure a clear comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary measure for the study was cerebral blood flow, assessed using a non-invasive imaging technique called pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. This advanced method allows researchers to quantify the amount of blood reaching brain tissue without the use of radiation or contrast dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary outcomes included cognitive performance, which was evaluated using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, a series of computerized tests designed to measure memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function. The researchers also monitored blood pressure and gathered data on dietary intake through food frequency questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging results revealed a statistically significant improvement in brain vascular responsiveness following the peanut intervention. Global cerebral blood flow increased by 3.6 percent compared to the control period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the analysis focused specifically on gray matter, which contains the cell bodies of the brain’s neurons, the increase in blood flow was 4.5 percent. The researchers observed regional improvements as well. Blood flow increased by 6.6 percent in the frontal lobes and 4.9 percent in the temporal lobes. These areas of the brain are intimately involved in processing memories, language, and executive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were intrigued to see improvements not only in specific brain regions, but also at the whole-brain level,” Joris told PsyPost. “That indicates a more widespread effect on brain vascular function than what we observed in earlier studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the physiological changes, the researchers identified improvements in cognitive function. Participants demonstrated a 5.8 percent increase in verbal memory performance. This was measured by a delayed recall task where participants were asked to identify words they had seen on a list twenty minutes earlier. Those who had consumed the peanuts were able to correctly recognize more words than they did during the control period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that eating unsalted, skin-roasted peanuts every day can support brain health as we age,” Joris said. “After 16 weeks, participants showed better brain blood flow and improved memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memory improved, the study did not find significant changes in executive function or psychomotor speed. There was a slight increase in reaction latency during one of the multitasking tests, which the authors suggest might reflect a trade-off where participants prioritized accuracy over speed, although this particular finding requires further verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond brain health, the intervention appeared to benefit cardiovascular metrics. Systolic blood pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading, decreased by an average of 5 mmHg during the peanut consumption phase. Pulse pressure, which represents the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, decreased by 4 mmHg. These reductions are relevant for older adults, as elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary analysis confirmed that during the peanut intervention, participants had higher intakes of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, and fiber, while their carbohydrate intake was lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the addition of approximately 340 calories per day from the peanuts, body weight remained generally stable across the study population, though there was a minor interaction effect depending on the order in which the participants completed the intervention and control phases. This suggests that participants may have naturally adjusted their intake of other foods to compensate for the added peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations that provide context for the findings. Due to the nature of the dietary intervention, it was not possible to blind the participants to the fact that they were eating peanuts. This awareness could potentially influence their behavior or self-reported data, although the researchers analyzing the MRI and cognitive data remained blinded to the treatment conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the results show a clear association between peanut consumption and improved vascular function, the specific biological mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. It is not yet known if the effects are driven primarily by L-arginine, the phenolic compounds in the skins, the fatty acid profile, or a synergistic combination of these nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by The Peanut Institute Foundation. The authors state that the funding body had no role in the design of the study, the collection and analysis of data, or the decision to publish the results. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research directions include investigating whether different forms of peanut products offer similar benefits. The investigators also aim to explore the dose-response relationship to determine if smaller amounts of peanuts could yield comparable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to examine whether different peanut preparations, such as peanut butter, produce similar effects,” Joris said. “In addition, we seek to clarify which peanut components may underlie the observed benefits. To this end, we are now conducting a study assessing the effects of protein on the same outcomes, given that peanuts are rich in protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One important point is that the peanuts were unsalted and skin-roasted,” the researcher added. “The skin contains many antioxidants and fibre that may contribute to the beneficial effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2025.10.020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Longer-term skin-roasted peanut consumption improves brain vascular function and memory: A randomized, single-blind, controlled crossover trial in healthy older adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Lucia Kerkhof, Ronald P.
