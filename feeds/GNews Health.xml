        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN MARCOS, Texas — Health officials in Hays County are warning residents about a possible measles exposure after a person who tested positive for the illness visited San Marcos on Feb. 14.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Hays County Health Department, a Gaines County resident who tested positive for measles was in San Marcos from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. that Friday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were at Texas State University from approximately 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Twin Peaks Restaurant from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who may have been exposed will be notified by their local health authority, health officials said. The Hays County Health Department, the Texas Department of State Health Services and other local health agencies are working together to investigate potential contacts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades,” said Hays County Local Health Authority John Turner, MD. “Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. To minimize the risk of infection and serious illness, individuals should make sure they are vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of people who are not vaccinated or have not had a previous measles infection will become infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department will contact people who are known to have been in contact with the person who later tested positive for measles to provide guidance.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with any symptoms is asked to contact their primary care provider, urgent care or an emergency room to set up an appointment and quarantine for four days after the onset of a rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were in the possible exposure locations during the specified times should:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization and medical records. People who have not had measles or have not been vaccinated should talk with a health care provider about MMR immunization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant or have a weakened immune system, regardless of vaccination history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from four days to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Call a health care provider immediately. Do not enter a health care facility before calling and making them aware of your measles exposure and symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Hays County Health Department is acting with haste to ensure the readiness and preparedness of partner agencies in response to this notification,” said Hays County Judge Ruben Beccera. “The county has taken great strides to improve our response to public health emergencies. I am confident that the department will be capable of minimizing the impact of a potential measles outbreak in our county. I will work with the [health] department and Office of Emergency Services to offer additional resources as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for two hours, even after the infected person has left.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected person can spread the disease up to four days before a measles rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms for measles include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (as high as 105 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash three to five days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

It comes after shocking cases emerged of the lungs of heavy users collapsing, as well as fainting and throwing up a mystery green liquid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin added that there is also evidence that fitness levels can be affected by excessive use of the products, which are currently recommended by the NHS as a smoking cessation tool. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin met with the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk"&gt;Mirror&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the study. He explained the reason behind his findings: “Smokers tend to go outside and smoke, and once a cigarette is finished they have to light up another to keep going. But with vapes, you just keep going and it’s much harder to know how many puffs you’ve had. It’s much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers. At the beginning (of the study) I also believed that vaping was more beneficial than smoking. You see a lot more people vaping these days because they don’t think it’s too bad. Many will be horrified to know the truth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study participants were aged between 18 and 45, all with similar levels of fitness ability. They were put under stress tests to measure the speed of blood flow to their brains, and the elasticity of their blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they found was that vapers appeared to have damaged artery walls which were unable to dilate. This is said to be an indicator of future cardiovascular problems. Dr Boidin blames the findings on nicotine, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin irritating the delicate blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says: “When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can’t expect nothing to happen.” Vaping use in the UK has exploded since the first electronic cigarettes arrived here in 2005. There are now 5.1million people aged 16 or over in Britain - about one in ten - using vapes, according to figures last year from the Office for National Statistics. Vaping rates were highest among those aged 16 to 24, at 15.8%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One million people in England now vape, despite never having been regular smokers, a seven-fold increase in three years, according to a University College London study published in The Lancet Public Health Journal. And, despite recent vaping scares, like the death this year of Hollyoaks star Paul Danan, aged 46, who months earlier revealed he’d had to be revived after suffering respiratory failure caused by excessive vaping, Public Health England is still advising that “vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaping side effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart disease&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organ failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;scroll-depth-observer data-event-markers="1%,25%,50%,75%,90%,100%"&gt;&lt;/scroll-depth-observer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 16:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQU2FuYmI4aVoyWF94RjJNSkJEcEk4cEc5aW5jNkdyeHdVQ202M0Niamdxb182cWx2VkRiWmxRVHE1bXl5d0dIenpjT1RsXzAwa1FfZGo1QUtIN1JfLUI4YjdiSWFkMkR1VnBELXZYOTh1RS1GREs3aERtMGFNcjNSYkVqbmMzNXFsS0HSAY8BQVVfeXFMTWUxV3d5Rk9IeWdlQ1o2S3ZSNktsUUFCSm9haDVfcmQxWHRwR2VpR1hvaEQwc3BFRmdrOWRwNlgyWUdDVXdISTRFZUVjNHN4N2FEQWVhMFNVMkhfRno2SUtQWXhoYWxFc3lJS1lNU19aWFdfUE5kVFNYdHlrTlpybXcxU2wxem5PVjk0ZlIwQm8</guid></item><item><title>Low-Normal B12 Levels Linked to Slower Brain Processing - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5sMkhWM0lrOUVuNDkyZnhuZ2c2Q3F4N2xORlpzNVc3dUZzellPUl96ajh2M0ZuTlNkMU9WekprOElnNzU2MVdLMjlfSUt2cWtyRjVMOFIxZGFqTFphRGZ5YWd0eC1YbmotWmY1aXZya2w1TFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Even when within the normal range, lower levels of vitamin B12 may contribute to cognitive decline, according to a new study. Researchers found that older adults with lower biologically active B12 had slower cognitive processing and more white matter lesions, despite meeting current nutritional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the definition of B12 deficiency may need revision to incorporate functional biomarkers rather than relying on fixed thresholds. Researchers recommend further study and potential supplementation for older adults to prevent cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle Cognitive Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults with lower active B12 levels performed worse on cognitive tests measuring processing speed and reaction times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Lesions:&lt;/strong&gt; MRI scans revealed increased white matter lesions in participants with lower B12, which may contribute to dementia and stroke risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisiting B12 Guidelines:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers suggest current B12 recommendations may be insufficient for preventing neurological decline and warrant reassessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting the minimum requirement for vitamin B12, needed to make DNA, red blood cells and nerve tissue, may not actually be enough – particularly if you are older. It may even put you at risk for cognitive impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, led by UC San Francisco researchers, found that older, healthy volunteers, with lower concentrations of B12, but still in the normal range, showed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="Cognitive Slowness and Decline Linked to Low-Normal B12 Levels" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8k9cjwbKgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels were associated with more damage to the brain’s white matter – the nerve fibers that enable communication between areas of the brain – and test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt; on Feb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers led by senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, said that the results raise questions about current B12 requirements and suggest the recommendations need updating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower B12 correlates with slower processing speeds, brain lesions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants’ white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could “impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107923"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/b12-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.

While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ana27200-sec-0004-title"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable “normal” B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 14:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5sMkhWM0lrOUVuNDkyZnhuZ2c2Q3F4N2xORlpzNVc3dUZzellPUl96ajh2M0ZuTlNkMU9WekprOElnNzU2MVdLMjlfSUt2cWtyRjVMOFIxZGFqTFphRGZ5YWd0eC1YbmotWmY1aXZya2w1TFk</guid></item><item><title>Utah mom living with heart defect urges women to take charge of their health - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNaVk3RmlSWjNPREhBeHlfeXFHZFRpNHlpTjl2Mkl6SGQ2b0IzSjBzXzFWdXhFNVIyenN3QWRrTGZmRlhGUnZScGwtd3YySTgwb01CMU1RU0ktUnZRZFhmR0NxczRqNkxvTmRCaUk5TC01U28tY3k0aExBdGt3Yk1oWDNlV0k2T0Y5ejBTTDlZSDlyM2N0Nzd2WDUySGh6cnFFSHZnYU1kYlZHMEpaZ2w1T3N4SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

"I try really hard just to listen to my body and don't overexert myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams was born with an atrioventricular canal defect, a congenital heart defect where a hole between the heart chambers prevents proper blood flow. Her condition led to several surgeries and placed limitations on her childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to play soccer, and I couldn't," she said. "I just felt like the condition was ruling my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and millions of adults and children are living with heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Williams didn't think the condition was hereditary, her daughter was also diagnosed with a similar heart defect and underwent open-heart surgery at the age of 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fallon Williams is a busy mom of two who is also living with a cardiac condition.

Women wear so many hats, and we don't always take time for ourselves, especially mothers," she said. "Make sure that you know your numbers. Your blood pressure numbers, your resting heart rate, your heart rate when you're working out, if any of those seem off, just go to the doctor. Just get yourself checked out, because you never know if you could be one of those numbers in those statistics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams was nominated to be a Woman of Impact with the American Heart Association, where she is helping raise money for heart health research.

Now, new research suggests that certain bacteria in your mouth could play a role in your risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a complicated condition, with many different factors that influence when and if a person develops it. But the latest findings suggest what’s happening in your mouth could be linked on some level with your brain health. Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Bramen, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark S.

The participants were broken into two groups: One group had no detectable decline in brain function, while the others had mild cognitive impairment, a condition where people have more memory or thinking problems than others their age. People with mild cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants provided the scientists with mouth rinse samples, which were then analyzed, allowing the researchers to break down the bacteria contained in each sample. The researchers discovered that certain bacteria found in the participants’ mouths were linked with having better memory and attention; Others were associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are associated with memory and attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that people who had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus had better memory and attention. They also could do complex tasks more easily, based on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are linked with memory loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who had higher levels of the bacteria Porphyromonas (a key pathogen in chronic periodontitis) in their mouths were more likely to have memory problems. The bacteria Prevotella (also commonly found in peridontel disease) was also associated with people having the gene APOE4, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does mouth bacteria impact brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; bacteria in the mouth to dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has generally suggested that having higher levels of harmful bacteria in the mouth may raise the risk of bodily inflammation, which could potentially &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; raise the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers in this study theorized that harmful bacteria could get into the bloodstream and damage the brain, raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They also suggest that a bacterial imbalance could impact how much nitric oxide is formed from nitrate, a compound in vegetables. Nitric oxide is important for memory and communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s hard to say for sure that the bacteria causes dementia or issues with brain health, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark S. Wolff, DDS, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark S. Wolff, DDS, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be careful not to assert a cause and effect when both of these things may just be happening at the same time,” he says. “People can have bad gum disease, and lots of bacteria, and develop Alzheimer's disease. Did one cause the other or did they just both occur because we weren't taking good care of our mouth while we were developing the Alzheimer's disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I make sure to have the “good bacteria” in my mouth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a plant-based diet seems to be a good start, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Bramen, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding nitrate-rich foods like veggies into your diet “can benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes,” she says. This may also help to suppress bacteria that’s linked with dementia, Bramen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s hard to say at this point that these bacteria cause Alzheimer’s disease, they're just linked.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The genetics of schizophrenia is very complex, and it is rare that mutations found in patients can be linked directly to the disease,” said study leader Uwe Rudolph, a professor of comparative biosciences at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Schizophrenia is not yet diagnosed by any kind of lab test or imaging; it’s still a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms. The hope is that these kinds of rare mutations could lead us to the biochemical and physiological pathways that are important to study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began when a genetic mutation was found in two patients with schizophrenia at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. They had multiple copies of a section of DNA that included the gene for GLDC. Curious as to whether the mutation contributed to their symptoms, the McLean team studying the patients reached out to Rudolph’s lab to create a line of mice with the same mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice with mutations analogous to those in the human patients also showed schizophrenia-associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further narrow down the genetic link, the researchers next developed lines of mice with multiple copies of only a few genes contained within the larger chromosome segment repeated in the patients, then a single gene: GLDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that extra copies of the GLDC gene alone were sufficient to render the schizophrenia-like behaviors we had observed,” said Rudolph, who also is affiliated with the Neuroscience Program and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why multiple copies of the GLDC gene would be solely responsible for the behavioral symptoms, the researchers took a closer look at what was happening in the brains of the mice, specifically to the levels of glycine and the function of NDMA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that extra copies of GLDC would result in a lower level of glycine in the brain, since it degrades glycine. Then there would not be enough glycine to help activate the NDMA receptors,” said Illinois postdoctoral researcher Maltesh Kambali, the first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We measured an increase in activity of the GLDC enzyme in the brains of our mice, which would point to that as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers measured glycine levels in the brains of their mice, there did not seem to be a significant difference between those with the extra GLDC and healthy mice. So Rudolph’s team turned to colleagues in Germany who had developed sophisticated methods of tracking glycine in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German team found that, while the overall amount of glycine in the whole brain was similar, the amount of glycine outside of the nerve cells and available to help activate NDMA receptors was significantly lower in a subregion of the hippocampus in the mice with multiple copies of GLDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see why this region of the brain was so affected, Rudolph’s team then worked with researchers at Harvard Medical School to perform functional studies on the affected brain subregion, called the dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified decreased activity in the neural synapses, the active junctions that send signals between neurons. They pinpointed differences in long-term potentiation, a sustained strengthening of activity in the synapse during the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw how glycine measurements and the long-term potentiation measurements were showing converging changes in this dentate gyrus region, but not in other regions of the hippocampus. It’s interesting because one theory links the development of psychosis to the activity in the dentate gyrus. So our findings fit with that theory,” Kambali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois team then conducted a biochemical analysis of the dentate gyrus in the mice with extra copies of GLDC. They found that some pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia had reduce activity, indicating that the increase of GLDC and associated decrease of glycine was indeed sufficient to inhibit the NMDA receptors’ function and was involved in the schizophrenia symptoms they had observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study demonstrated at multiple levels how GLDC functions as a novel regulator of NMDA receptors,” Rudolph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dysfunction of NMDA receptors has been shown to be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Yet this finding also is relevant independently of disease, as the NMDA receptor is essential for many brain functions, including learning and memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Shervert Frazier Research Institute at McLean Hospital, the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and a Harvard Brain Science Initiative Bipolar Disorder Seed Grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R21MH104505, R56MH112642, R01MH115957, R01HD096326, R01MH123155, R01NS093200, P50MH115874, R01MH123993, R01MH108665, R01MH051290, P50MH094271 and U01AA020889.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this schizophrenia and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd989c95919f988f9abd949191949392948ed3989988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Ahlberg Touchstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Ahlberg Touchstone – University of Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02711-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An increased copy number of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) associated with psychosis reduces extracellular glycine and impairs NMDA receptor functio&lt;/a&gt;n” by Uwe Rudolph et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An increased copy number of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) associated with psychosis reduces extracellular glycine and impairs NMDA receptor function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at excitatory NMDA receptors in the brain, especially in the dentate gyrus, which has been postulated to be crucial for the development of psychotic associations and memories with psychotic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs modulating glycine levels are in clinical development for improving cognition in schizophrenia. However, the functional relevance of the regulation of glycine metabolism by endogenous enzymes is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a chromosome-engineered allelic series in mice, we report that a triplication of the gene encoding the glycine-catabolizing enzyme glycine decarboxylase (&lt;em&gt;GLDC&lt;/em&gt;) – as found on a small supernumerary marker chromosome in patients with psychosis – reduces extracellular glycine levels as determined by optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in dentate gyrus (DG) and suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in mPP-DG synapses but not in CA3-CA1 synapses, reduces the activity of biochemical pathways implicated in schizophrenia and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and displays deficits in schizophrenia-like behaviors which are in part known to be dependent on the activity of the dentate gyrus, e.g., prepulse inhibition, startle habituation, latent inhibition, working memory, sociability and social preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;Gldc&lt;/em&gt; negatively regulates long-term synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus in mice, suggesting that an increase in &lt;em&gt;GLDC&lt;/em&gt; copy number possibly contributes to the development of psychosis in humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 14:33:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1DMUhCdWlvUnpIOWt1OG1JaVk1dHlHMFQxVUpRcXBMbVR1WXdHVWgzdG5jTnY0amo2Y1FIV0hpeDdod0hZODl1MDdueVR6TkwyUjVXelpGUS12LWFuaUgzYlJ5UHkwRDg3azhGUHdhQkowdw</guid></item><item><title>Repurposed Blood Pressure Drug May Treat ADHD - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9jeS1xOXQ4U2hwM09tUXY0WHZvcWFCbkxTNGxOTnlJYm91SzdEVzJWVkZidVRQOTdCLVQ2RW5JcS1pQU1GdFN4N1V0QXlnMDZidlN0c2x6WnROanBPZlplVXNZYW5JQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study suggests that amlodipine, a widely used blood pressure medication, could help manage ADHD symptoms. Researchers tested five potential drugs in rats bred for ADHD-like behaviors, and only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity. Follow-up studies in zebrafish showed that the drug also decreased impulsivity, confirming its effect on ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier and targets calcium channels linked to ADHD. A review of patient data also found that individuals taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and reduced risk-taking behaviors.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm its effects the team tested amlodipine in zebrafish, an important model for studying brain function sharing about 70% of genes with humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that amlodipine also reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity—core symptoms of ADHD—in these fish. Further analysis of the fish revealed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier for the first time, meaning it can directly influence brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to human genetic data and found that, remarkably, ADHD is linked to the same calcium channels in the brain as the targets for amlodipine. This suggests a potential target brain pathway for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an analysis of UK-wide patient data showed that people taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and less risk-taking behaviour, further supporting its potential as a new ADHD treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matthew Parker, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current ADHD medications are effective but come with significant side effects: from appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches and sleep disturbance and carry a risk of misuse. Amlodipine, which is already widely used and well-tolerated, could offer a new, safer treatment option for ADHD.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 25% of patients do not respond well to any current ADHD medication, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropsychopharmacology and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b9b6e4e5e6e394a7a1a6a6b1adfab5b7faa1bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melanie Battolla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Melanie Battolla – University of Surrey&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02062-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Validation of L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a novel ADHD treatment through cross-species analysis, drug-target Mendelian randomization, and clinical evidence from medical&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew Parker et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation of L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a novel ADHD treatment through cross-species analysis, drug-target Mendelian randomization, and clinical evidence from medical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly affects life outcomes, and current treatments often have adverse side effects, high abuse potential, and a 25% non-response rate, highlighting the need for new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates amlodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a potential foundation for developing a novel ADHD treatment by integrating findings from animal models and human genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amlodipine reduced hyperactivity in SHR rats and decreased both hyperactivity and impulsivity in &lt;em&gt;adgrl3.1&lt;/em&gt;−/− zebrafish.

Afterward, Drews says, he didn’t just feel like a different person. He basically was one — with food, clothing, workout and vacation habits that have almost completely overridden everything he used to spend his money on, to the tune of more than $100,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDXRX2QATVB7HFVLGPYGBSE67M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s a whole new life,” Drews said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6DI7DMCQNCHLFDX554G4PYZRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He is just one consumer.

Hatzius’s analysis was based primarily on the idea that healthier people mean a healthier workforce and, in turn, lower health-care costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGUGJQ2VE5DFPFI5UOUXUF6NEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s a lot more to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZTWMK4YV5ADZE6LEFA55I65PU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When we think about how the drugs work, it directly changes the purchase of foods.

There’s “major opportunity” in supporting GLP-1 users “through this transformational period and capture the value from enabling their new behaviors,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSLVZNPGSJADTEJ2YYJUNRJRFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Companies are already reporting tremors and adjusting their product lines and marketing to match. Walmart’s CEO has talked about seeing a “slight pullback in the overall basket” for food purchases among some shoppers. Rent the Runway, a high-end online clothing rental shop, has reported that customers are choosing smaller sizes and in more body-hugging styles. Life Time, Inc. — which is where a decent chunk of Drews’s money is going these days — has launched a “performance and longevity” subscription program that includes doctors inside its fitness clubs that can prescribe GLP-1 drugs when appropriate, metabolic blood testing, meetings with a dietician, and access to personal trainers. It focuses the importance of a long-term, 360 degree view of health and wellness that begins for many people when losing weight on the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DHVO76DIH5GKZDZZJM7WRQUNMM" data-apitype="header" level="1" id="DHVO76DIH5GKZDZZJM7WRQUNMM"&gt;Winners and losers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KCCZOL4XZGSZIFNU7DW5LMUGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A Midwesterner born and raised, Drews taught himself computer programming and worked for manufacturing companies in the steel industry before pivoting to law school. He had a lot of success in his new career, but the high-stress job working 16-hour days six days a week did not leave a lot of room to focus on his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XW5SBPEAFREIBJEROI4KRWQPRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 63 and standing 5-foot-11, he hit 287 pounds and was told by his doctor that he was “pre,” or borderline, for a lot of health conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. He had also become frustrated he was missing out on hiking and other activities with his four grown kids, who were then 27 to 34, because he became tired and out of breath so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XASCSIUF5VFTHCQOU7UN6F6XQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews’s transformation began pretty quickly after he started on a GLP-1 drug. He lost the first couple dozen of pounds on Ozempic (he later switched to Mounjaro, which is considered more potent because&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it targets two hormones rather than one) without much effort, mostly due to being less hungry, and what he describes as sporadic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WKO6PJXKOZE6FA6CZKAKAKAZ3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At his annual checkup a year later, Drews’s doctor reiterated concerns about muscle loss and lectured him about increasing his fitness activity. This time, Drews was all in. A lot of the money he saved on food went into paying for a personal trainer — at $140 an hour, twice a week — who put together a comprehensive plan that included a strength coach, cardio coach, Pilates class for stability, pool time and more. These days, he’s up at 4:30 a.m. and at the Life Time in Burr Ridge, Ill. near his home shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VNDOIII3VVD2ZN2LI2QUXUHUIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His eating habits completely changed, too. It wasn’t exactly a decision, he says. It was almost instinctive. He had zero interest in food and often forgot to eat, a common experience among GLP-1 users who have reported on social media and to doctors that what they call “food noise” is gone, with some saying they even feel ill at the thought of eating Hostess cupcakes, Doritos or other ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJFJTJKB5FD7LNLQOJX2Q4OME4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’d eat a handful of peanut M&amp;amp;M’s at night for no good reason. Now, I can’t imagine doing that. It’s hard for me to even remember what I was eating it’s been that long,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3BWQZRYRZEXXKGUKPBKKOLJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews’s eating became more deliberate and about putting the right kinds of calories into his body rather than enjoyment or whimsy. A typical breakfast is three eggs, a half-cup of egg whites along with overnight oats and blueberries and half a banana. For lunch, ground venison or ground bison and vegetables. Dinner: salmon, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and broccoli. Snacks are a combo of yogurt, raspberries, cacao nibs, and honey or walnuts, peanuts and macadamia nuts, and for drinks: exclusively water, coffee and matcha. He mostly eats at home despite his family teasing him that he’s become “an antisocial eater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LZAFYNTO2NFCJFSEFQIBJ2VHNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He has heard that some food companies have created new products optimized for GLP-1, but he has not tried them and does not intend to for now. Nestlé is betting on meal and nutrient replacements for those eating less. CookUnity and Daily Harvest, meal delivery companies, have created GLP-1 “companion” lines focused on smaller but calorie- and protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F2RTRJINOJDCNH5VVEOMFYLSYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews is what consumer marketers might describe as a “premium purchaser” who might reallocate the money spent on total consumption to higher-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTJZ3PY4RFHSHEXVVNS4IFI4IQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Why not buy filet mignon when you only have the appetite for a few ounces of steak?” KPMG’s Andrew Lindsay, the company’s top consumer and retail strategy analyst, wrote in a recent report about GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BFUWYI7SDJCNZOQIYPAMRMBAUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An analysis by research firm Grocery Doppio shows plenty of ups as well as downs in food spending nationally, with sales of lean meats increasing 27 percent in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023, while sales of whole fruits and vegetables were up 13 percent. Sales of snacks and confectionary purchases,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which include chocolate, candy and sugar-coated treats, were down 52 percent, while prepared baked good sales tumbled 47 percent. Gaurav Pant, chief insights officer for Grocery Doppio, said that while the company initially saw grocery basket sizes fall, they jumped back up as shoppers shifted toward higher-quality foods — such as organic produce and premium protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WF3ZEI2QJFDXXI4VKA34VWS624" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We believe that a decent portion of GLP-1 users may actually increase their grocery food spending over time,” Pant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XN2QVNVD3FEJVFR4P5OLSA3FNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Drews calculates his spending on food is more than it was in the past. His biggest-ticket items are venison and bison, high-protein, lean red meat he is having flown in from Hawaii following a recommendation from a friend. “It’s super high in nutrients, raised on grass grown on lava from Maui,” he said. It runs $31 a pound vs. about $5 a pound for ground beef at a grocery store. He eats it every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OPJDHUOGANETPOUCO4AN4VXBDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;By June 1, 2023, he had 14.5 percent body fat. (He’s now at 10.5 percent.) The average American man has 28.1 percent. He was thrilled with the results and went into maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YO7YFYIPWJECBOJ74AGV6QUCJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’ve been heavy my whole life,” he said. “I’ve never had six pack abs before.

When he began to work out every day, he noticed that the baggy T-shirts and shorts from Dick’s Sporting Goods weren’t cutting it and, during a trip to the mall, walked into Lululemon for the first time. With the frequency of his workouts, he said, and “in all honesty, emerging muscles,” he wanted clothes that were more durable, fitted and stylish. He dropped hundreds of dollars on workout-wear basics and kept coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MS6Q7DOKPFBSLKFGEEWSF2AZAA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While his taste in dress shirts and suits for court didn’t change — he still favored Nordstrom’s selection — he needed to buy the same or similar clothes in new sizes three times as his body shrank, losing 2½ inches in his neck and eight inches in his waist. He went from XXL down to XL, then large and, most recently, medium, which he says is as small as he will go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGDA3IGRKJBTZDL6NLZ4QWVRJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recently, Drews was reading a lot of books — such as Herman Pontzer’s “Burn” — about health, activity, longevity and modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DDUTDNIDFFHEJNDF5SWLWTDWBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pontzer is an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University and, for about 15 years, has been measuring metabolisms of all kinds of people: ultra-athletes, office workers, members of the Hadza tribe in Tanzania, who still hunt and gather their food.

&lt;p&gt;It’s OK to brush off this advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One piece of “conventional wisdom” has echoed through households for generations, threatening those just trying to rush out the door — “Don’t go outside with wet hair, otherwise you’ll catch a cold!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/the-cold-and-flu-must-haves-you-need-to-buy-before-you-get-sick/"&gt;With cold and flu season well underway&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/29/myth-busted-doctor-reveals-what-really-happens-if-you-swallow-gum/"&gt;old wives’ tale&lt;/a&gt; may be ringing in your ears. But one internal medicine physician puts a damper on the lore, noting that there’s no scientific evidence that stepping out with damp locks on a brisk day will spark the sneezin’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There’s no scientific evidence that you will catch a cold if you step outside with wet hair. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SHOTPRIME STUDIO – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The belief that you can catch a cold by going outside with wet hair is a myth,” &lt;a href="https://www.cwclv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Christopher Choi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in Las Vegas, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wet hair does not directly have any bearing on catching &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/the-cold-and-flu-must-haves-you-need-to-buy-before-you-get-sick/"&gt;a cold&lt;/a&gt;,” he explained. “A cold is caused by viruses, typically rhinovirus.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Wet hair does not directly have any bearing on catching a cold,” one internist said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;dikushin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Rhinoviruses are considered the primary cause of the common cold, estimated to be responsible for 50% to 70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two primary modes of transmission for rhinoviruses, according to Choi, are “coming into contact with individuals infected with a cold who coughs and the other individual inhales the droplet, or by touching a surface infected with virus, which can live for hours, and then touching your face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s one myth busted. But then why is it that — anecdotally — some people are adamant that they do seem to get the sniffles whenever they dismiss this superstition?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even though wet hair doesn’t directly cause colds, it can potentially contribute to body temperature dropping slightly, which could minimally contribute to catching cold,” Choi shared. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Colds are typically transmitted by breathing in the droplets of an infected person.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the biggest culprit is most likely the weather and not your head, especially since “there is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4311828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/22/health/childhood-respiratory-illnesses/"&gt;rhinovirus&lt;/a&gt; multiplies better in cold weather,” Choi said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, chilly temperatures are likely to weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when you’re exposed to cold weather, the blood vessels in your nose constrict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you have decreased protection against rhinoviruses because “the typical route of transmission is the nasal passages,” Choi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from catching a cold&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching your face&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stay away from sick people &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stay warm&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s clear how certain habits mentioned above could affect your cognitive health (like wearing a helmet, for example), other factors are a little more nuanced ― but are just as important to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, socialization is a true indicator of brain health. “We are social beings ... and there are even changes in metabolic activity and brain activity that occur when we’re isolated that are harmful,” Ellison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With isolation comes loneliness, which can put you at higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, Ellison added. “It’s very important to cultivate a social network,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg also noted that those with close family and friend connections can also get more support when recovering from health issues, which is important for well-being, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The factors that seem to relate more to heart health, like blood pressure, are important, too. “Almost everything that’s good for the brain is actually also good for the heart,” Ellison said. “When the heart is functioning properly, it provides nutrients and oxygen, which fuel the brain and keep it healthy, and it helps remove toxic metabolites from the brain as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the heart is not functioning properly, the circulation and oxygenation and metabolic care of the brain is compromised, and that can lead to cognitive changes,” Ellison continued. He added that one of the most common kinds of cognitive decline in older people is “vascular cognitive impairment, which is a direct result of compromised circulation in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said simple, small positive habits, like diet and exercise, can often bring the biggest health rewards. She recommends a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7833708" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and said you should talk to your doctor about the best exercise regimen for you, as it varies person to person. Additionally, if you smoke, you should talk to your doctor about quitting, to protect both your brain and your overall health, Garg said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also important to manage your &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you"&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt;, and you can talk to your doctor about how to best do that, too. “There are so many different ways to curb anxiety and stress, but people don’t realize how much of an impact it can make on your body and your brain,” Garg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7833708" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that anxiety is linked to higher rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are questions you should bring up throughout your life, not just once you reach a certain age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Earlier, more reliable &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; detection means better post-diagnosis support and more opportunity to understand how it gets started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the UK and Slovenia have now found specific brain activity and breathing patterns can act as signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152858" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team set out to study how oxygenation of the brain might be linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, comparing measures of brain oxygenation, heart rate, brain waves, and breathing effort of 19 Alzheimer's patients to 20 people without Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis found differences in neurons linked to blood vessels and in how blood oxygen levels fluctuated as neurons fired. The sync of blood flow and brain activity seems to be noticeably disrupted in Alzheimer's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152861" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152861" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract.jpg" alt=" Breathing abstract" class="wp-image-152861 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GraphicalAbstract-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152861" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers linked brain and breathing changes to Alzheimer's. (Bjerkan et al., &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, there was an unexpected extra: the Alzheimer's patients had a higher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"&gt;breathing rate&lt;/a&gt; than the control patients, around 17 breaths per minute compared to 13 breaths per minute. This is possibly a result of changes in how blood vessels in the brain connect with deeper nerve tissues to provide a generous supply of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an interesting discovery – in my opinion a revolutionary one – that may open a whole new world in the study of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Aneta Stefanovska, from Lancaster University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It most likely reflects an inflammation, maybe in the brain, that once detected can probably be treated and severe states of Alzheimer's might be prevented in the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup for the analysis involves a variety of electrical and optical sensors on the scalp – but it doesn't require any blood or tissue samples, and is cheaper and quicker than a lot of other diagnosis options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while breathing patterns on their own wouldn't yet be enough to detect Alzheimer's, with so many other variables in play, researchers can now look at respiratory rates in future studies to build up a more complete picture of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;Alzheimer's symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supports &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925443915003701"&gt;the hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that Alzheimer's disease is triggered by a breakdown in the functioning of the brain's vascular system, which reduces the efficiency of oxygen flow and clearance of toxic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The vascular system and the brain work together to ensure that the brain receives sufficient energy," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Bernard Meglič, from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In fact, the brain needs as much as 20 percent of the body's overall energy consumption despite contributing only about 2 percent of the body's weight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's much to consider with Alzheimer's – from symptoms to risk factors – that it's likely that a combination of causes are working in combination, but research like this helps get us closer to understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radical-study-proposes-a-single-cause-to-explain-alzheimers-disease"&gt;the disease's progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show clear results of our approach and how Alzheimer's can be detected simply, noninvasively, and inexpensively," &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/news/a-new-approach-to-detecting-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stefanovska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The method has great potential, and we are discussing possibilities to create a spin-out or start-up company to proceed with it. Of course, more research is needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/1/fcaf007/7994547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Protein is core to building muscle and, even more so, maintaining it, Klingbeil says. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that adults eat 0.36 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. But an &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1174-1" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that 42 percent of men and 50 percent of women over age 70 don’t get that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts recommend even more protein for older adults to compensate for muscle loss and the fact that building new muscle becomes harder with age, Klingbeil says. Aim for 0.45 to 0.59 gram per pound per day—that’s 72 to 94 grams for a 160-pound person. (But if you have kidney disease, check with your doctor about your protein intake because too much can tax your kidneys.) Dietitians generally recommend spreading protein throughout the day because that may help your body absorb it better, but Klingbeil says that getting enough is the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/nutrition-healthy-eating/the-truth-about-protein-drinks-a4199144682/"&gt;source of protein&lt;/a&gt; isn’t super-important for building muscle, says Travis Masterson, PhD, the Broadhurst Career Development Professor for the Study of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/how-red-meat-can-fit-into-a-healthy-diet-a3360518260/"&gt;Animal foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more per serving than plant sources. But for other aspects of your health, it’s best to get at least some of your protein from plants, such as beans, nuts, and tofu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plant-based diet that includes mostly whole foods is good for your heart and brain, and it lowers your risk of certain cancers. “It also appears to be gentler on the kidneys than a diet high in animal protein as we age,” says Judy Lester, MS, a clinical dietitian at the University of North Carolina Health Care System in Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 20 grams of protein in a cup of tofu; about 18 grams in a cup of lentils, white beans, or edamame; 8 grams in a cup of quinoa or whole-wheat pasta; and 7 grams in an ounce of peanuts. Beef, salmon, and chicken breast have about 24 grams in 3 ounces. A 5.5-ounce serving of plain nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/yogurt/healthy-yogurts-that-taste-great-too-a1114386696/"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has 16 grams, a cup of low-fat milk has about 9 grams, and an egg has 6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;

At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable," Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some officials are reluctant to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated," Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. "That's just what it means to be an American, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 08:49:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFAxVTR6cDdHV1VtZWpsUG9xSUxCcmxjUWN2ZzcySjBEb1EzYzJmX2N0aHh0RmFYbGhIRVdlM2VUeDQ2dm8tcVF3RE5ibDZfTFVPUWNvZmdaVUpBUUtMT1k5a0s3REdSbGtqVlpfbkhLNTNKWmpCS0dlcGlLNTQ</guid></item><item><title>8 benefits of eating 1 guava daily - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPclQtbENKX0RuTjZ2NThZZDMtZEVLNnNOc0JZRXRFRk04RG1ycGRRaHEwUHBhc2lQYkQ0LTJPVkNFWW9xRjFtYVYyMjBwdWdiLWNFUWpYR0ZYNEQ5eDJ4MC0wejlBUDV0eTNQb1VmVnFidzhQcmVhSHM4VmZHcmNhMzk5MjhOMUlGZlY2MkgySFliMGFxZVNkVnNibkJWMUFWcUhZdFJLYXAxZGZaM2l1UnhkRU1BRXNXemh6dzhsMHJLN0xXX1lRNENUTV9rZ9IBzgFBVV95cUxPclQtbENKX0RuTjZ2NThZZDMtZEVLNnNOc0JZRXRFRk04RG1ycGRRaHEwUHBhc2lQYkQ0LTJPVkNFWW9xRjFtYVYyMjBwdWdiLWNFUWpYR0ZYNEQ5eDJ4MC0wejlBUDV0eTNQb1VmVnFidzhQcmVhSHM4VmZHcmNhMzk5MjhOMUlGZlY2MkgySFliMGFxZVNkVnNibkJWMUFWcUhZdFJLYXAxZGZaM2l1UnhkRU1BRXNXemh6dzhsMHJLN0xXX1lRNENUTV9rZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;What foods are good enough to nourish cu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;Yoga poses to straighten spine (and redu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 08:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>The Most Common COVID Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing In Winter 2025 - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many viruses circulating this winter, including &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, which is making people ill across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID has continued to circulate year-round, and we’re starting to see patterns where there’s a clear uptick of activity in the winter,” said &lt;a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/graham-snyder" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Graham Snyder" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/graham-snyder" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t surprising, Snyder said. In the colder months, we’re more likely to socialize indoors, where germs can more easily spread.

Instead, you should prioritize rest, Nolt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One symptom people aren’t really experiencing? Loss of taste and smell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the one thing we’re not seeing is... that loss of smell or taste that people often talked about early in the pandemic,” Nolt explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms haven’t been prevalent since early 2022 when the omicron variant came around, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photographer, Basak Gurbuz Derman via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photographer, Basak Gurbuz Derman via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you test positive for COVID, there is antiviral medication that can help you feel better faster.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you feel sick, you should take a COVID test.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not feeling well, it’s a good idea to take a COVID test — regardless of whether you have mild symptoms or more severe troubles. A number of winter illnesses have symptoms that overlap with those of COVID-19, but there is antiviral treatment specifically for COVID that can help you feel better faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antiviral treatment is particularly important for folks who are more at risk of having a severe infection. That includes older people and people with underlying health conditions, Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the antiviral treatment to work, you have to take it earlier in the course of the disease. The longer you wait, the less likely it is to be successful,” Snyder said. In other words, it’s important to know whether you have COVID as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t necessarily have all of the symptoms mentioned above, according to Snyder. You may have one, or a few, he said, “but those are all typical symptoms of COVID-19.” For some people, their infection will result in no symptoms at all, while others get sick enough to end up in the hospital. That’s another reason it’s important to take a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To stay healthy, get the most recent COVID shot if you haven’t yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a 2024-2025 seasonal &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-covid-vaccine-fall-2024_l_66c77ebee4b029313b6f6fbe" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID vaccine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7899fe4b04144c748cb47" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66c77ebee4b029313b6f6fbe" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and it’s recommended for everybody six months of age and older,” Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest shot can help reduce the chances that you get the virus ― and if you do get sick, it can help prevent complications that might otherwise lead to hospitalization and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;p&gt;Between a nine-to-five job, caring for kids, and juggling an already-packed workout schedule, something as simple as balance training might take a backseat. But as we age, our balance naturally declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple tests such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/can-t-balance-on-one-leg-a-physical-therapist-says-you-need-to-do-this-strength-boosting-exercise" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/can-t-balance-on-one-leg-a-physical-therapist-says-you-need-to-do-this-strength-boosting-exercise"&gt;standing on one leg&lt;/a&gt; or using a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/wobble-board-challenge" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/wobble-board-challenge"&gt;wobble board &lt;/a&gt;can help you assess your balance. However, balance training is essential to maintaining functional fitness—which is the strength to perform everyday tasks like climbing stairs or getting up from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? You don't need to spend hours training to see improvements. Physical therapist Jessica Valant has shared a simple balance routine that only takes 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-10-minute-balance-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the 10-minute balance routine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

"It is never too late to get better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heard the one about Ozempic? Haven’t we all — if only millions of Americans who could benefit from this and other trendy weight-loss drugs &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/health/ozempic-which-costs-up-to-1300-can-be-made-for-5-study/"&gt;could get them covered through their insurance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to sign up for the pricey jabs to shed the pounds, some experts say — there’s a way to beat the odds in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/health/ultra-processed-foods-drive-colorectal-cancer-risk-prevent-healing-study/"&gt;a food culture that seems rigged against those struggling&lt;/a&gt; to control their eating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a processed food, treat yo’ self world, nutrition expert Mark Hewett of &lt;a href="https://gainsnutrition.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gains Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; says that there’s an easy way to take back control — and it’s not counting calories, or running your tail off at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ginger’s low glycemic index is just one of its many benefits, an expert explained. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Luis Echeverri Urrea – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding what drives hunger, according to Hewett, is the key to making better choices. In focusing purely on willpower, people overlook important contributors such as the glycemic index, or GI, of foods. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number, which you can easily look up for any food your thinking of eating, tells you how it will impact your blood sugar — and how quickly your cravings will return after you eat.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing foods with low-GI, Hewett said, could in fact be the quickest and easiest way to naturally learn appetite control&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Most people focus on calories, but research shows that the way foods impact blood sugar can be just as important in managing hunger,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Low-GI foods (with a glycemic index of 55 or less) are digested and absorbed more slowly, leading to gradual blood sugar changes instead of sharp spikes and crashes. This helps regulate appetite, keeping you full longer and reducing cravings naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ready to put the science to the test? Here are six low-GI foods to work into your diet — see how they work for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocados&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Africa Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of just 5, avocados digest incredibly slowly, providing steady energy without triggering the blood sugar spikes that often lead to cravings,” Hewett explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Their combination of fiber and healthy fats keeps appetite hormones in check, making them one of the most effective foods for natural appetite control.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asparagus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nata_vkusidey – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, asparagus is an excellent choice for appetite control. Its high fiber content slows digestion while adding volume to meals, helping you feel full without excessive calories. Asparagus also supports gut health, which plays a crucial role in hunger regulation,” Hewett said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;kuvona – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, almonds offer a powerful blend of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Unlike high-carb snacks that cause sugar spikes and crashes, almonds digest slowly, providing steady energy and preventing sudden cravings. Their nutrient profile also helps regulate appetite hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which control hunger and satiety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Olives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Igor Dutina – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, black olives provide a unique mix of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols that support appetite regulation. These healthy fats slow digestion, keeping you full longer. The polyphenols in olives have also been linked to reduced inflammation, which prevents erratic hunger signals.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chili&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kristen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, chili peppers contain capsaicin. Capsaicin has been shown to mildly boost metabolism while suppressing appetite, making it a powerful tool for natural weight management. Consuming spicy foods can lead to a lower calorie intake throughout the day without conscious effort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Atlas – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, ginger is well-known for its digestion-enhancing and appetite-regulating properties. It helps control hunger by increasing thermogenesis (calorie burning) and improving insulin sensitivity, preventing post-meal crashes that trigger cravings,” Hewett said.” &lt;/p&gt;

Four more kids died from the flu during the week ending Feb. 15, increasing the seasonal pediatric death toll by more than a third, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to COVID-19, “we just thought about older adults as getting sick,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. “We have to reset with flu. Because with flu, it’s not just the very old, it’s also the very young. And they can do very poorly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15 children who died from the flu this season includes &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/fourth-san-diego-county-teen-dies-from-flu/3755554/" target="_blank"&gt;four teenagers from San Diego&lt;/a&gt;. None of the teens — aged 14, 15, 16 and 17 — had received flu shots, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These recent flu deaths among our youth are tragic and concerning as we head into what historically is the peak of flu season,” Dr. Ankita Kadakia, San Diego County’s interim public health officer, said in a statement  this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined, particularly among children, for the flu and other ailments, according to Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2020-2021.html#:~:text=Among%20children%206%20months%20through%2017%20years%2C%20the%20percentage%20receiving,(63.7%25%3B%20Figure%201)." target="_blank"&gt;roughly 58% of&lt;/a&gt; children between 6 months and 17 were vaccinated against the flu during the 2020-21 season, declining to about 45% as of late January of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the world of vaccines, that’s like falling off a cliff,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend is similar in California: 47.7% of California’s children have been vaccinated against flu as of late January, the lowest since at least the 2019-20 flu season. Last year at this time, 53.7% of children were vaccinated against flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends everyone&lt;/a&gt; 6 months or older get a flu shot — ideally by the end of October to boost protection against the disease during high-circulation winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two types of flu generally circulating now are H1N1 — related to the swine flu strain that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-aug-10-la-sci-who-flu-20100811-story.html"&gt;caused a flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 and 2010 — and H3N2, which “is notorious for just causing more serious illness in general,” Chin-Hong &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-11/worst-flu-season-in-5-years-hits-california"&gt;said previously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how potent this flu season has already proved to be, officials say those who have yet to be vaccinated should consider doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flu activity remains high, it may be decreasing. California public health officials’ recent report shows a 3.4% decline in the rate at which flu tests returned positive results at the state’s clinical sentinel labs for the week ending Feb. 15, the most recent for which complete data are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the test positivity rate sits at an elevated 23.3%. COVID-19 and RSV activity is low, health officials said, with positivity rates of 2.3% and 5%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said it’s not yet clear if the downward trend will hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s too early to celebrate,” he said, adding that more data points are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu season in the U.S. typically &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20flu%20season%20usually%20occurs%20in%20the,varies%20from%20season%20to%20season." target="_blank"&gt;peaks between December and February&lt;/a&gt;, though the virus spreads year-round, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s on the decline, the virus is known for having a prolonged season, Chin-Hong said. It can run through April and sometimes later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only the peak that we’re worried about,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s also the breadth of what’s happening this year.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were about 500 deaths last season from the flu by this point in time, and 600 the year before, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/22/more-than-900-californians-including-15-children-have-died-from-the-flu-this-season/" target="_blank"&gt;the Mercury News reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong estimates he hasn’t seen a death toll like that of this season in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Rong-Gong Lin II contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 01:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPMGY1bGJRWDZkUEozUnBhSmZCWFFtMmxNbFRlSGUwazlGeDVwZ283bHFsRTZHZW02R1JUdzEzc1dXSzNfbFltQnUzNWpZbThuWmV5UVNKOGVnTzZ6bFdOUEItb3l4RV9ScUtlNEJhek03UnowS3lfMHpoQUhzMkptalU0djZvLWdYMWpPcmU3T1hKMi1EVlh4amgxUWk3bDM2SDNMd1ZmeTNQOFRuYjFxOUhJakQ1cUxPZFhEWGpkV19YTFE5cHhzRV9CNlFXNV9jWUg1bVJsaE8</guid></item><item><title>More than 900 Californians, including 15 children, have died from the flu this season - The Mercury News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu season is off to a deadly start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 900 people have died from influenza since the beginning of October in California, more than have died at this point in any of the last six respiratory virus seasons, according to a report released Friday by the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of those deaths have been among people under 65 years old. Older folks tend to be the most at risk, with about 700 people 65 and older dying so far this year from the common virus. But at least 15 children have also succumbed to the flu, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/fourth-san-diego-county-teen-dies-from-flu/3755554/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four teenagers in San Diego County&lt;/a&gt;, raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared to the data reported over the course of previous flu seasons, the toll this year has already exploded past the totals from the last several flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point of the season, Week 7, there were about 500 deaths last season, and 600 the year before, but in both of those seasons the deaths had already started to plateau by mid-February. This year, the number of deaths has yet to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a surprise” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco professor of medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. He said it was projected to be an average season, but it is turning out to be anything but. And with test positivity rates still high, there are at least a few weeks left of the virus’s sending people to the hospital before it retreats for its annual hibernation, which usually begins as spring turns to summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is surprising, first of all that we didn’t see much COVID, and secondly that we saw a lot of flu,” Chin-Hong said. “And not just flu — bad flu which is making people seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it is important for people to know that despite its being late in the typical virus season, it is not too late to get vaccinated against influenza, whether they have had one strain already or not. Chin-Hong also wants to remind people of the antivirals available to combat the worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamiflu, an antiviral used to treat the flu, can also be used prophylactically to prevent the spread of the virus within a household, and Chin-Hong would recommend those who are living with elderly or at-risk family members to ask their doctor about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last really bad flu season was in 2009, for swine flu,” Chin-Hong said, “since then it has kind of been regular flu seasons, until this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there’s still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease. Here’s what you should know about how to protect yourself against measles, as well as what’s happening in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where are measles spreading?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Texas cases are concentrated in Gaines County, which has 57 infections, and Terry County, north of Gaines, where there are now 20 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawson County, to the east of Gaines, was new to the count with six. Yoakum County has four and Lubbock, Lynn and Ector counties have a case each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/measles-outbreak-raises-concerns-about-drop-in-vaccinations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles outbreak raises concerns about drop in vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas state health department data shows the vast majority of cases are among people younger than 18: 26 in kids younger than 4 and 51 in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles and three cases are “pending” an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/ector-county-health-department-confirms-positive-case-of-measles-in-ector-county-resident/"&gt;Odessa American&lt;/a&gt; its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20one%20of%20the,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes."&gt;according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95 percent — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinic and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;

At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In New Mexico, officials said nine people had been sickened in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically received during childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in Texas say those numbers are likely an undercount, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable," Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's American news partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Symptoms of the highly infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a signature rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death, and survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the measles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have without evidence questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as President Donald Trump's health secretary, faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But some officials are reluctant to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated," Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. "That's just what it means to be an American, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;American children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 23:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBlN1NJWmlQenVYSTlTdERoeVhaWjVmR0twTFc0Q2dkdTRibXZXbmtRS0tUWm1CTmhrV1lWbGhEUXBQTjhQdkowZzEzOFFIS1pMTzRuTWdOLU5SZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1temxEeDVIUktMb3dael9EVFU2am9OZ3ZieFJjd2pzc0lULWNiQ1d0d043OTNVblNFa0ZkSmNXOG03dlpYNE51bzFFVTZtZUljbDhIME9CRjAtOWpwRDRB</guid></item><item><title>If You Received a Measles Vaccine in This Decade, Check Your Records - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1IVF84eHc1eXFvNzJ1elQ2M0toTUo2dDFZdDN4NURSNGRYRHlKU0FnN3E0OFlBQWpfbWdwLTBpVExyV0RWT0hxT3BjeHpoRTJpLW1oWHZQbkJwNHNZVHM4TDE2OUktQTV5c3hzRXV4SGcxZFMzMHJqMzBoQlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Do You Need An MMR Vaccine?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PeopleImages - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, or rubeola, probably isn’t an illness you’ve thought too much about, and there’s good reason for that. In 2000, the highly contagious virus was declared to be eliminated in the U.S. It had been a full year since any cases were reported, thanks to high rates of vaccination with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MMR (measle,mumps, rubella) vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MMR (measle,mumps, rubella) vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically given in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2019, there was &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20191009measlesupdt.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a major outbreak of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a major outbreak of measles&lt;/a&gt;, when it appeared in 31 states, for a total of 1,249 cases. Of those cases, 75% occurred in New York City or New York State, primarily among unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last five years were outbreak-free, but &lt;strong&gt;as of February 18, 2025, Texas is experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114261?xid=nl_mpt_morningbreak2025-02-19&amp;amp;mh=ea0493d246c868ccab6e61d7ce11d245&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4xC9FpuWPTqYhw97pyhhSupo-ZiielIroe_rhz1wbxXQ5DP4jFN9_aRIHIrWSKy39iLu68HbtCWfke7KVJQgPlrIkd4szaHpX4GQ5nqaAGveSdM%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:its largest measles outbreak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;its largest measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;in almost three decades. &lt;/strong&gt;So far, 58 cases have been reported, many of which concentrated in a rural Gaines County community where all the patients are unvaccinated; 13 have been hospitalized. Additionally, eight measles cases have been identified in an adjacent part of &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114261?xid=nl_mpt_morningbreak2025-02-19&amp;amp;mh=ea0493d246c868ccab6e61d7ce11d245&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4xC9FpuWPTqYhw97pyhhSupo-ZiielIroe_rhz1wbxXQ5DP4jFN9_aRIHIrWSKy39iLu68HbtCWfke7KVJQgPlrIkd4szaHpX4GQ5nqaAGveSdM%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Mexico;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the concern is that measles will spread widely, and fast, to other parts of the country. That's because, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-rising-us-texas-outbreak-grows-concerned/story?id=118892122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to data from ABC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to data from ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, more and more parents are opting for exemptions so that their children don’t get the MMR vaccine. During the 2022-23 school year, 3% of all kindergarten students nationwide did not get the vaccine, the highest rate of exemptions ever in the U.S. Texas has an even higher exemption rate of 17.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC recommends two doses of MMR immunizations, with the first dose at age 12 to 15 months and the second dose age 4 to 6 years,” says &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/profiles/1538335104/ruchika-jain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ruchika Jain, MD, MMS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ruchika Jain, MD, MMS&lt;/a&gt;, Infection prevention &amp;amp; control physician at &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Montefiore Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Montefiore Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY. “One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults can get measles, too – and the last thing you want is this potentially serious virus spreading through your family. We consulted some top doctors to get important details about measles and advice on what you can do now to keep your kids – and yourself — safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exposed to measles, you’ll start showing symptoms one to two weeks later. &lt;a href="https://health.ri.gov/diseases/measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The “three C’s”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The “three C’s”&lt;/a&gt; are the classic hallmark of an early measles infection – cough, coryza (runny nose) and/or conjunctivitis (pinkeye) — plus a fever, which can spike as high as 104 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fmeasles%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20374857&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, additional symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koplik’s spots, which are small white spots that have a bluish-white center and a red background in your mouth, lining your cheek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A skin rash with big blotches that connect to each other and can become raised, spreading from your face to your arms, chest, back, thighs, lower legs and feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin that appears darker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peeling skin about a week later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;, measles can cause diarrhea and ear infections, both of which can become serious. Very severe complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis. Children under the age of 5 are most likely to experience these complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is present in the nose and throat of a child or adult, and is spread by that person coughing or sneezing droplets or by contact with surfaces the droplets have landed on.

If you read any misinformation that says otherwise on social media, or hear people say the vaccine is unsafe, take any questions you have straight to your doctor.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s vital that you know the correct facts about the vaccine, and not avoid it by mistake for your kids and/or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you were vaccinated against measles as a child, do you need a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The MMR vaccine prevents measles in most people for life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The MMR vaccine prevents measles in most people for life&lt;/a&gt;. “If you have received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child, it’s likely you’re protected,” says &lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-yoshua-quinones/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yoshua Quinones, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yoshua Quinones, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in New York City. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions, though. “If you received a measles vaccine in the 1960s, you should look into your vaccination records,” says Dr. Jain. “Those who have documents showing they received a live measles vaccine in the 1960s do not need to be revaccinated. People who were vaccinated in the 1960s with a measles vaccine of an unknown type should be revaccinated with at least one dose of live attenuated measles vaccine. From 1963 to 1967, there was a vaccine available that used dead measles virus, which proved to be ineffective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “healthcare workers may have their MMR levels of antibodies tested,” Dr. Jain continues. “If the test is negative, another single dose of MMR should be administered. Antibody levels may also be checked during pregnancy; you can work with your physician to determine the safest time to receive this immunization.” Ask your doctor about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questhealth.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeasles-mumps-rubella-mmr-test-94356M.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopxMlTYqCfyLmoxKPFYbPpCHBFmqi9OBrH_wJJNYlYMHyXeA_a2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an MMR test;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;an MMR test&lt;/a&gt;, which will measure your immunity. This could be helpful if you don’t have documentation of your vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise? “If you had the two recommended childhood doses of MMR, you do not need another dose,” says Dr. Doron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you’re an unvaccinated adult, should you get the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yes, yes and yes!” says Dr. Quinones. “If you have never been vaccinated or have lost immunity, it’s strongly recommended to get your vaccine as soon as possible.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to act quickly, because there’s a time lag in that the shot is a two-step process. “If you have not yet had an MMR vaccine, speak with your doctor to start the immunization process of two doses 28 days apart,” says Dr. Jain. “If you work in healthcare, travel internationally or are a higher education student, these settings have a higher risk for transmission.” Some people do need to avoid the MMR vaccine, including pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant (you can get it later), people with allergies, and people with certain illnesses. Again, ask your doctor about any concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else you can do to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you're a teacher around small children — how can you max out prevention? “Ensure that you’re fully vaccinated, and always wash your hands,” advises Dr. Quinones. “If you are a teacher, it’s highly recommended for you to be vaccinated against MMR. Encourage parents (at your school) to get their kids immunized by explaining the risks and benefits of the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been vaccinated, doing your normal virus prevention stuff – hand hygiene, avoiding those who you know are sick, and wearing a mask–can add an extra layer of measles protection. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.questhealth.com%2Fproduct%2Fmeasles-mumps-rubella-mmr-test-94356M.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopxMlTYqCfyLmoxKPFYbPpCHBFmqi9OBrH_wJJNYlYMHyXeA_a2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa63869110%2Fmeasles-booster-vaccine%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If you get vaccinated within three days after being exposed to measles;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;If you get vaccinated within three days after being exposed to measles&lt;/a&gt;, you may not get sick, or have a milder course of disease, too.

Analyzing data from a large-scale study of older adults, they found that optimism was linked to lower stress and greater resilience, while lower pessimism was associated with safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimistic individuals worried less, felt less lonely, and exercised more, contributing to better mental health. However, when it came to behaviors that reduced COVID-19 risk, lower pessimism—not higher optimism—was the key factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a less pessimistic outlook were more likely to stay home and avoid risky activities. The findings suggest that fostering optimism and reducing pessimism could help people better cope with prolonged stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and Well-Being:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimistic individuals had lower stress, greater resilience, and engaged in more physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism and Risk Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; People with lower pessimism were more likely to avoid risky behaviors like traveling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coping Strategies Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral adaptations, such as exercising at home or using virtual social interactions, contributed to well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see the glass as half empty or half full? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you rewind to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, chances are you experienced some level of pessimism. And who could blame you? With social isolation, health concerns and economic uncertainty, fear and anxiety became a daily reality for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Syracuse University and Michigan State University recently explored the personal characteristics that help people handle prolonged stressors, such as the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Jeewon Oh, assistant professor of psychology in Syracuse University’s College of Arts and Sciences, the group delved into optimism and pessimism and how those mindsets influence well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group utilized data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large-scale panel study that gathers a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 and older (Sonnega et al., 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, participants responded to questions assessing their levels of optimism, such as “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best,” and pessimism, such as “I hardly ever expect things to go my way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and May 2020), respondents answered questions on health-related behaviors that either increased or reduced the risk of COVID transmission, including masking frequency, travel habits and the likelihood of staying home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used this data to explore how people’s mindsets affected their psychological and physical well-being during challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among their findings, they found that greater optimism promotes resilience and well-being when faced with stressors like the pandemic, while lower pessimism is linked to safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following Q&amp;amp;A, Professor Jeewon Oh shares some key insights from their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the motivation for this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeewon Oh (JO): The pandemic introduced many changes, and we wanted to know more about personality traits that can help people cope with enduring and uncontrollable stressors like the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined optimism, because it motivates action. Since optimists view stressful situations positively, they are more likely to directly address the issue or try to adapt when things are uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the benefits for those who were more optimistic? How did optimism/pessimism correlate with well-being during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): Both optimism and pessimism had independent associations with psychological well-being. So, people who are more optimistic and less pessimistic worried less, were less stressed and lonely and were more resilient. This was partly because these people engaged in more physical activity and perceived more social support and less strain from their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when it came to COVID/health-relevant behaviors, pessimism played a significant role, but optimism didn’t. In other words, individuals with a less pessimistic mindset (but not a more optimistic mindset), who have weaker negative expectations tended to engage in less risky behaviors, such as traveling, and more activities at home ranging from watching TV and gardening to meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does optimism or pessimism influence the way people approach challenges and setbacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): In general, regular optimism/pessimism isn’t about thinking they wouldn’t get sick, or they will be more likely to get sick (compared to others), but about knowing the reality and still thinking that things will eventually work out. This positive mindset helps people to problem-solve and cope. Afterall, if you think things would never work out, why would you even try?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a way to boost one’s optimism during times when they may be more anxious, like during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): It can be easier to think about doing what optimists do rather than trying to think differently (or change your optimism). So, people with lower pessimism mentioned changing their behaviors to adapt to the situation, meeting with people on Zoom more frequently and exercising at home (vs. going to the gym and meeting up with people in person). It was these changes in behaviors like exercising more that partly helped people’s well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this study reveal about health and psychological well-being in the post-pandemic world? What factors can we consider for maintaining and improving mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): There has been evidence before the pandemic that optimistic people fare well in many situations. Even though more research is needed to understand why, our study found that optimists fared better even during new difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, developing optimism and learning how to flexibly cope can help maintain and improve mental health in diverse situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4c0d0c6c1d6cac5d6e4d7ddd68ac1c0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daniel Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://syr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Bernardi – Syracuse University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2024.104541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;” by Jeewon Oh et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examined the association between optimism/pessimism before the pandemic and adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, optimism was associated with behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission and higher psychological well-being (βs&amp;gt;|.196|) through changes in social contacts (indirect effect βs&amp;gt; |.004|) and/or increases in physical activity (βs=|.01|).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating optimism and pessimism, we found that only pessimism was associated with behaviors that reduce risk, but &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; optimism and pessimism were associated with psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating them in the context of new public health challenges, we found that while the presence of optimism and absence of pessimism may both be resources for well-being, the absence of pessimism may be particularly important for health-relevant behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:27:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1MUU1BN0lXck0tUVNjd2d3bzZBT0dHNWV6UTdWUmZEYldQRktWT0RBNVFudDJmcUhsRUwxcXJMdWFEZ0hRMmxjVHBfb0VzU0VWbFVnZ0xKV0lmWVoya0x4MHdxaXN4MERNOWRaOGdFUUNyNHc</guid></item><item><title>What happens when you diet by removing ultra-processed foods?

These guidelines do not mention ultra-processed foods (UPFs), even though they are linked to serious health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chips, candy, and other mass-produced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tool-lets-you-check-how-processed-your-food-is-grocerydb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;packaged foods&lt;/a&gt; often replace natural ingredients with additives. Studies show eating UPFs increases the risk of diseases and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these risks, no major dietary programs focus on reducing UPF intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers from &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt; designed an intervention. The goal was to help people eat fewer ultra-processed foods using multiple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-ultra-processed-foods-the-basics"&gt;Understanding ultra-processed foods – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are the heavily modified, lab-created stuff you find in most grocery store aisles – think packaged snacks, sugary cereals, instant noodles, and even some protein bars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go through multiple industrial processes, packed with additives like preservatives, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-neotame-has-shocking-effects-on-gut-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;artificial flavors&lt;/a&gt;, emulsifiers, and loads of sugar or refined oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods are designed to be super convenient, hyper-palatable, and have a long shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: they often lack real nutrition and can mess with your metabolism, gut health, and even brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link them to everything from obesity and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and even mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, ultra-processed foods are everywhere, and they’re marketed as quick, tasty, and sometimes even “healthy” options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because they’re engineered for taste and texture, they can be addictive, making it easy to overeat without feeling full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, their ingredient lists often look more like a chemistry experiment than actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-ultra-processed-food-intake"&gt;Reducing ultra-processed food intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drexel University program went beyond education. It included mindfulness strategies to handle cravings, one-on-one meal planning, and household involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also provided financial support to help participants buy healthier foods, which can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-month intervention involved 14 adults with overweight or obesity who ate at least two UPF items daily. On average, participants cut their UPF intake by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing UPF intake can be extremely difficult, because the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-make-our-bodies-age-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; industry wants us to be hooked on UPFs,” said lead author Dr. Charlotte Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The industry designs UPFs to be ultra-delicious, convenient, cheap, and constantly present in the U.S. – even if not directly in front of us, then on our TVs, phones, and roadside signs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-promising-results-from-the-intervention"&gt;Promising results from the intervention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the small sample size, the results of the trial were encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the program, participants had nearly halved their UPF &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake&lt;/a&gt;, measured both in calories and total items consumed. They also reduced their daily calorie intake by more than 600 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar consumption declined by 50 percent, while saturated fat intake dropped by 37 percent. Sodium intake also saw a significant decrease of 28 percent. On average, participants lost 7.7 pounds over the two-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, participants did not have meaningful increases in their fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that if we want to improve dietary intake more holistically, we may need to more strongly encourage people to eat these foods,” said Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-intervention-worked"&gt;How the intervention worked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants met weekly with health behavior coaches in both group and individual sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They learned how to identify UPFs, cope with cravings, and improve their home food environment. Each participant received a $100 grocery store gift card to support healthier purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track progress, the participants completed detailed food intake reports. They documented everything they ate on selected weekdays and weekends using a specialized assessment tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified foods as UPFs or non-UPFs, consulting experts when needed to avoid bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psychological-benefits-of-cutting-upfs"&gt;Psychological benefits of cutting UPFs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond physical health, the participants noticed mental and emotional benefits. Many reported feeling better overall, with improvements in mood and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-are-harmful-to-nearly-every-part-of-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since UPFs can trigger addiction-like behaviors, reducing intake may help regulate emotions and improve mental clarity. Cutting back on UPFs also seemed to help participants feel more in control of their eating habits, making it easier to maintain a healthier diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of food choices, the program helped participants develop a healthier relationship with eating. This could be crucial for long-term success in maintaining dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-research"&gt;Next steps for research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that people can reduce their ultra-processed food intake, if given the proper tools, and that they will be enthusiastic about interventions designed for this purpose,” said Hagerman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results also suggest that reducing UPF intake will lead to meaningful health improvements – such as weight loss and better mood – in as short as eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to expand the study. Future work will test the intervention on a larger sample and evaluate which strategies are most effective. The researchers also want to see if the program works across different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the need for better public awareness and policies to reduce UPF consumption. Since UPFs dominate the food supply, long-term solutions should address accessibility and affordability of healthier alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education, financial incentives, and community-based programs could help more people reduce their UPF intake. As research continues, these findings may shape new approaches to improving public health through better nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity Science &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZzlvY1Ayb1dobWxfZDRmYjByU0tobVBpQUdXTkJWT29vR21nS2pKM3RiNG1fcWs4Z2tkTnJFWEZ4cGZ2Rl85YlVuSHZLWWcwRjhicW5hOGFzR2RkTndjZUhnXzY2SThVM3lTdHBHbkQzUWY2dlRwVFBOT1J3LTZJUWN3SnUxS1pmS0VSbnl5S3ZlQmswQWJ3UklvcWRmbFNC</guid></item><item><title>New coronavirus resembling COVID-19 discovered in bats: Report - Straight Arrow News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOeUZVd3puOExWRDdMTVBhY2tTZko3YzU0andxNEpyVXZJbGZMYWxna0YxUExhMnNxendGVFVvbFBfZ0l1LUYzX1hETWcxeEg4cmN2b0lRSDlFZnUzQ1RoY1NZSnhyX01SOGI5b01kWmpaTU1NZ3B3ckhNclFjWjJaT1VuUU13MVk1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignfull justify-content-center has-black-background-color has-background is-vertical is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt;

The research, which was published in the British Dental Journal Open, used advanced CT scans to analyze the skulls of 15 Viking-era individuals. It found evidence of chronic ailments that would have made their lives much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_47777" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47777" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47777" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg" alt="CT scans of Viking-age skulls reveal widespread disease" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-768x577.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-1-1140x856.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-47777" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Skull mounted in the CT-scanner. Credit: C. Bertilsson et al. BDJ Open (2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Results showed that many suffered from severe dental and maxillofacial diseases, including dental caries, periodontal disease, and periapical infections. The scans also uncovered signs of sinus and ear infections, osteoarthritis, and other skeletal conditions. This research suggests that these health problems were common and might have lasted for long periods because people back then didn’t have antibiotics or modern medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolina Bertilsson, the lead researcher and an assistant professor at the University of Gothenburg, said: “The results of the study provide greater understanding of these people’s health and wellbeing. Everyone knows what it’s like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn’t have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research builds on earlier studies examining the dental health of a larger group of Viking-age individuals from Varnhem, a historic site in Sweden’s Västergötland province known for its well-preserved ancient graves. While past studies focused on teeth, this new study went further by analyzing entire skulls with CT scans. This allowed the team to identify skeletal changes that may have been missed during conventional examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_47780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47780" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47780" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg" alt="CT scans of Viking-age skulls reveal widespread disease" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-300x248.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-1024x847.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-768x635.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-150x124.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-750x621.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-skulls-reveal-widespread-disease-2-1-1140x943.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-47780" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cyst of tooth 36, individual 12. Credit: C. Bertilsson et al. BDJ Open (2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;CT imaging provided a non-invasive way to examine the remains, preserving them while extracting detailed medical information. “Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information,” Bertilsson said. The method helped detect bone alterations linked to chronic infections, such as sclerotization of the mastoid process, infection-induced periosteal bone deposition, and sinusitis-related bone changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved collaboration with experts in dental radiology and an archaeologist from Västergötlands Museum. The researchers plan to expand on these results in future studies using CT scans to analyze a larger sample size and compare results with other Viking-age populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertilsson, C., Borg, E., Vretemark, M. et al.

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all scoured the internet for weight loss secrets. But just because the scale drops doesn’t mean your body’s on board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just look at the carnivore diet. The eating plan — which involves consuming only animal byproducts such as meat, eggs and dairy — has taken off among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/02/health/influencer-swears-by-carnivore-diet-but-experts-are-not-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;across the internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Devotees of the high protein, no-vegetable lifestyle swear it’s a game-changer for weight loss and overall health. Podcaster &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/tag/joe-rogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://routines.club/routine/the-joe-rogan-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;among the faithful&lt;/a&gt;, recently returning to the diet even after his first stint left him with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a30675936/joe-rogan-carnivore-diet-diarrhoea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explosive diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While most kidney stones can pass naturally, the process can be incredibly painful. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peakstock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Podcasting giant Joe Rogan has publicly touted the carnivore diet.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But experts are sounding the alarm. Many have raised concerns about the diet’s &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking-student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/taking-bite-out-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nutritional gaps&lt;/a&gt;, and now doctors from the Indiana University School of Medicine are warning that the carnivore diet could also increase the risk of painful kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These hard deposits, made up of minerals and salts, form in the kidneys due to diet, weight, and other factors. Most people can pass kidney stones naturally, though it can be incredibly painful. Depending on their size, they can block the flow of urine, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and the risk of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In a recent case study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524014199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, doctors revealed that a 68-year-old man adopted the carnivore diet after discovering it on YouTube — only to suffer serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While he lost 24 pounds eating 90% meat products, tests conducted six months later showed his body was already forming kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urine analysis revealed he had an increased risk of developing all three major types of kidney stones — calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid — with levels “consistent with stone growth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the doctors reported that the patient was kidney stone-free. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They pointed to the patient’s results as evidence of the “potential hazards of the carnivore diet,” noting that it creates the “optimal environment” for kidney stone development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians,” the doctors wrote. They recommended a fiber- and carbohydrate-rich diet to support gut bacteria and help prevent kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical community remains divided on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Red meat consumption has been linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even some cancers.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bit24 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-the-carnivore-diet-bad-for-cholesterol#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the eating plan’s impact on cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Red meat&lt;/a&gt;, butter, and cheese are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high in saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which can elevate levels of “bad” cholesterol in the blood, increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/health/61-of-us-adults-will-have-cardiovascular-disease-by-2050-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/lifestyle/how-to-prevent-a-stroke-stroke-association-issues-new-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While cutting back on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=decrease%20intake%20of%20sugary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sugary and refined carbs&lt;/a&gt; is generally a good idea, fruits and vegetables are a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=fruits%20and%20vegetables%20are%20a%20rich%20source%20of%20fiber%20and%20essential%20nutrients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rich source of fiber and essential nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that can help lower the risk of chronic diseases, manage blood pressure, aid in weight management and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=weight%20management%20and-,improve%20digestion,-." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;improve digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the side effects. When Rogan first tried the diet for a month in 2020, the podcasting giant said he lost weight and saw significant improvements in his energy levels and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s really only one ‘bad’ thing, and that thing is diarrhea,” Rogan wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joerogan/p/B7LPdnHlto7/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve come to accept that if I keep going with this diet it’s just a matter of time before we lose a battle, and I fill my undies like a rainforest mudslide overtaking a mountain road.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While diarrhea might be embarrassing, one Florida man’s symptoms were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/bizarre-side-effect-of-extreme-carnivore-diet-leaves-mans-hands-covered-in-yellow-nodes/"&gt;downright bizarre&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After eating nothing but butter, cheese and hamburger patties for eight months, he showed up at a Tampa hospital with ooze leaking from yellowish nodes on the palms of his hands, elbows and the soles of his feet. Doctors later diagnosed him with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol or excess fats in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cardiologists diagnosed the Florida man with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol levels or other fats in the blood. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Cardiologym 2024, Marmagkiolis et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, some experts argue the carnivore diet might benefit certain individuals. A few studies have identified positive outcomes, including a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299122106086?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; that found “high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being, and various medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/health/expert-shatters-myths-about-the-carnivore-diet-and-the-real-impact-it-has-on-your-health/"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; she has found the carnivore diet to be an “indispensable tool” in her clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us,” Ede said. &lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers at &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden have identified a fourth: breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery, published in &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/JP287205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, shows that pupils are smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation, revealing a fundamental mechanism that could influence vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like a camera’s aperture, the pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye. Changes in its size can affect how the world appears, sharpening details or enhancing the ability to detect faint objects. The newly discovered breathing-linked pupil fluctuation suggests that vision might subtly shift throughout each breath, alternating between clarity and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present, and requires no external stimulus,” says Artin Arshamian, an associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet. “Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Abstract figure.

It generates neural oscillations—rhythmic electrical activity in the brain—that influence cognition and perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These oscillations stem from the preBötzinger complex, a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/humans-may-actually-have-a-one-track-mind-after-all-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cluster of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the brainstem that regulates breathing. They also arise from the olfactory bulb when air moves through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies in animals have shown that these respiration-linked oscillations help synchronize sensory and motor behaviors like sniffing, whisking, and head movement. Similarly, pupil size plays a vital role in vision, influencing how the brain processes visual information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, direct evidence linking respiration to pupil changes remained elusive, with past research yielding inconsistent results due to small sample sizes and methodological flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify this connection, researchers at Karolinska Institutet conducted five carefully controlled experiments with over 200 participants. Their findings confirmed that breathing consistently influenced pupil size across various conditions, whether participants were breathing quickly or slowly, through the nose or mouth, in bright or dim lighting, at rest, or engaged in visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking results was that the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/lifechanging-new-eye-drops-can-make-reading-glasses-obsolete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil fluctuations&lt;/a&gt; occurred even in individuals born without an olfactory bulb, a brain structure typically associated with nasal breathing. This suggests that the brainstem alone may regulate the effect, highlighting its deep evolutionary roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_pupil_changes_may_shape_perception"&gt;How Pupil Changes May Shape Perception&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises intriguing possibilities about how vision shifts in response to breathing. Pupil size directly affects how light enters the eye, influencing visual acuity. A smaller pupil, like a camera lens set to a narrow aperture, enhances sharpness and depth of field, making it easier to see fine details. A larger pupil, by contrast, allows more light to enter, improving sensitivity to dim or distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Polar plots of participants’ pupil sizes over the course of the breathing cycle. 0° (Inh) marks the onset of inhalation, 90° marks peak inhalation, 180° (Exh) marks the onset of exhalation, and 270° marks peak exhalation.

Tasks requiring high visual precision, such as reading or threading a needle, might be easier when inhaling. Meanwhile, scanning for movement in low light, such as spotting a shadow at night, might be enhanced during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="potential_applications_in_medicine_and_neuroscience"&gt;Potential Applications in Medicine and Neuroscience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its effects on vision, the link between respiration and pupil size may have medical applications. The autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions, regulates both breathing and pupil response. Abnormalities in this system can signal neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pupil size during paced breathing.

If respiration-induced pupil changes serve as an additional diagnostic marker, they could offer a new, non-invasive way to detect early signs of neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will determine how this discovery might be applied in medical diagnostics and whether breathing techniques could be used to modulate attention and perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much remains to be explored, this study offers a new perspective on how breath, brain, and vision are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNUnQ5ak5UZ2JYU3gzQVNBVjdTR05XeXd6ckpWUXRyVmw4Q3BhTHV6UXktT01QNVk0bDFLOXprZWhSN0ZPQkIxUVdFTGt0Rk1hLTlaZFE2eUJwSUtsSHlfRzNYdktMQzhyNmdYcUl0cDhiNlVFTGxDRmJVRFJuR3pJVTdPNXdUbDU4VVZpZlUzR2RsUFc4dHRoR2dZeDRDZ2ZoWnZwN2lqRDBONlk</guid></item><item><title>This New Paper About Eating Out of Plastic Containers Is a Bit Terrifying - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBuai1iMVFSNWhiRGgxcGZJc3JqUExTTlR5RzBGMjdScEF1RF95N1hKS2VfY0pla3lZaE9fTGFQbFA0YjhOcUVfbVIteTVEaGRKRDNZb29UOUdtTHllalFnVnpSM0NmMGhocnZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have some bad news for those of you that love getting takeout, because those plastic containers that your steaming delicious meals come in? They may well be sabotaging your heart health, new research suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As detailed in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593#sec0150" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team of Chinese researchers found that rats that were given water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been boiled and then stored in common takeout lids showed significant disruptions in the gut biome, including inflammation — a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In many cases, they also observed extensive damage to myocardial tissue, or heart muscle. The work is the latest to highlight the alarming toll that &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;exposure to ubiquitous microplastics&lt;/a&gt; can have on the body — and how &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-dying-chemicals-plastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;easily it can seep into our food and beverages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides a control group, the rats were divided into three groups that drank boiled water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been exposed to the plastic takeout containers — known as leachate — for one minute, five minutes, and fifteen minutes respectively. They drank this regularly for three months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surprisingly, no single rat pack stood out; they all roughly exhibited the same degree of worrying symptoms, like changes to the composition of their intestinal microbacteria and damage to the heart muscle. This suggests that any amount of exposure could put you at risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The study shows plastic exposure as a significant [cardiovascular disease] risk factor regardless of duration," the author wrote. "It leads to changes in myocardial tissue, gut microbiota, and metabolites, all closely tied to [cardiovascular disease]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the rat experiment, the team also surveyed nearly 3,200 people in China with self-reported questionnaires about how often they were exposed to plastics and about symptoms related to their cardiovascular health. This is flimsier stuff than the rat trials, but nonetheless, it found that frequent plastic exposure was linked to a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are, however, some notable limitations to the study. Regarding the human survey, that there was a correlation between plastic exposure and heart failure may be due to "individual differences within the surveyed population," the authors wrote, noting that only exposure within the past month was investigated. No biological samples were taken from the human respondents, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the rats, the scientists weren't able to measure the amount of and kinds of plastic particles in their bodies. And while there was notable damage to myocardial tissue, none of the rodents exhibited full-blown cardiovascular disease. Still, this may be because of the short nature of the experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Further research is necessary to elucidate the health impacts of long-term exposure to plastic products, as well as the accumulation and distribution of plastic particles in tissues and organs, to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of appropriate safety measures in the future," the authors conclude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime? They suggest avoid using plastic takeout containers for hot food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on plastics: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-vessels-clots-mice-scientists" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Microplastics Getting Stuck in Brain Vessels Like Clots, Scientists Find, Causing "Neurological Abnormalities" in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBuai1iMVFSNWhiRGgxcGZJc3JqUExTTlR5RzBGMjdScEF1RF95N1hKS2VfY0pla3lZaE9fTGFQbFA0YjhOcUVfbVIteTVEaGRKRDNZb29UOUdtTHllalFnVnpSM0NmMGhocnZ3</guid></item><item><title>The sticky, slippery promise of castor oil packs - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5RR1Frc01tVTdKQ3BEdXhKaklReWJWa2M0SFBCYjlHa3lqcURkQXhWYlc0anhVdTQ0M0p4TkwtQ2REdnNNeGxoY0pZZ2hBaXBUSnIzWVpJMG9hZ0p0TGttSTZRc3dEQjQ4UjBvdTVlbThYejBJU2djZmdfNHFKMWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZEEFBFFS6JFIDCEVWFM6UBFQE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Before she goes to bed, Lisa Brezinski slathers on a thick, sticky layer of castor oil — often on her stomach, but sometimes on her neck or over her upper abdomen.

Daniel Ricciardi, a pharmacist, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGewmt38FoU" target="_blank"&gt;said in a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; that “a lot of evidence [on castor oil packs] just does not exist right now, and there’s not a huge incentive for Pharma companies to fund a lot of studies for castor oil.” He noted that skin irritation and allergic reactions are possible but that using castor oil is “relatively safe if not ingested orally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Z4HX73J5FHQHC7MMKYBNDMGLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drrubainadang.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rubaina Dang&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor, said castor oil packs are “one of the oldest old-school tricks in the book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEWBWOW6VVGJVPYCIXRRDW6Z6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For her patients with hormonal imbalances and digestive issues, she prescribes castor oil packs to help with symptom relief. She tells those with painful periods to either soak a piece of cloth in castor oil or roll the castor oil onto their abdomen or uterus area, apply another cloth over it, and then put a heating pad over that. She advises her patients to do this 3 to 5 times per week for about 30 to 60 minutes. She said there’s no exact recommendation for using castor oil packs and people need to find what works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYHPYT3O6ZB5NDMT5W4CKHIGEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dang said castor oil may lead to uterine contractions, so people should not use it during their menstrual cycle, if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. She also said not to use it on an open wound or if you are dealing with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMXVQBDMXZE73FOMTPRKFNFGOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Beyond internal benefits, castor oil can clear your skin, Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P45ONOG5GND6ZCP4VUUB5V2ZJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The liver plays a big role in skin health,” she&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;explained. The liver processes hormones and filters toxins, but when it’s sluggish, that excess waste doesn’t clear properly, leading to acne and rashes. “By supporting the body’s elimination pathways, like digestion and regular bowel movements, castor oil indirectly improves skin health,” Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y"&gt;A nightly ritual&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYFOI6PBU5GO5KUF2JTOTTBEF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not everyone opts for a full-on castor oil pack. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ameliarrmei?_t=ZT-8tfHWk6wNtm&amp;amp;_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;Amelia Mei &lt;/a&gt;stumbled across one of her favorite influencers on Instagram raving about castor oil for bloating.

However, he still fully understood what was going on around him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only was he suffering from a brain condition, but he also developed 'locked in syndrome,' &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14410285/Scientists-capture-end-life-brain-activity-prove-humans-souls.html"&gt;a coma in which a person can't move or talk&lt;/a&gt; but is still conscious.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His condition was severe and deemed terminal. Doctors believed there was nothing they could do for him so he was sent home, where he said his family didn't realize he was still aware of his surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While trapped in his body, Mr Haendel heard nurses call him 'brain dead' and a family member say he would likely die soon, but the most shocking thing he heard was an argument between his father and then-wife, which ended in a violent altercation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jake Haendel detailed his journey with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL) on his TikTok, Instagram and a new podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's ordeal began in May 2017. He was newly married and the head executive chef at a restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, he noticed 'I kind of felt weird.' He had a higher pitched voice than normal, &lt;span&gt;his balance was unsteady and he swerving while driving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ellen, now his ex wife, told him he should go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to the emergency department and was admitted with stroke-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I still thought I would go home and it would be like any other time I was in the hospital... b&lt;span&gt;ut life would definitely never be the same.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time morning came, eight doctors surrounded Mr Haendel's bed with 'somber looks' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said doctors told him: 'We're so sorry you have six months to live. You have an extremely rare brain disease.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel, now 36 and a Boston resident, was diagnosed with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL), a condition that damages &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13751285/husband-suffered-brain-injury-flung-motorbike-headfirst.html"&gt;brain regions that help with communication and body movements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told him his symptoms would get worse very quickly, taking away his ability to walk and confining him to a wheelchair. After that, his body would contract and he'd be in 'a lot of pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then would lose the ability to eat, swallow and talk. Eventually he would need tubes to breath and a feeding tube to get nutrients 'until you slip into a coma and likely die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was told there was no chance he would get better:&lt;span&gt; 'I wished they warned me how much pain I was actually going to be in.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As time went on, everything doctors said would happen did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL damages the brain's white matter, which connects brain regions that help with communication and body movements and plays a crucial role in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White matter is full of nerve fibers protected by a covering called myelin. Myelin protects the fibers and helps send messages and electrical signals in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel said two nurses were gossiping in his room. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, the other responded saying he couldn't hear them because he was 'brain dead'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to these interrupts the transmission of messages and communication between brain regions, leading to problems with movement and speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL has multiple causes, including environmental toxins, pesticides, chemotherapy and drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told Mr Haendel his condition resulted from a toxin he inhaled. He and his doctors aren't sure exactly what toxin, but Mr Haendel had been using heroin and he said he was regularly exposed to chemicals and pesticides in his day job as a chef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajnr.org/content/40/2/267"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;analyzing approximately 100 patients with ATL found opioids were the second most common cause of the condition (19 percent) and led to the second worst outcome in patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel was repeatedly transferred from long-term care facility to the hospital to rehab clinics since his illness was deemed terminal and doctors didn't know how to help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the while, Mr Haendel heard people discussing him, thinking he wasn't conscious. Little by little, he noticed the medical staff caring for him eventually stopped acknowledging and talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;BuzzFeed he heard a member of his medical team complaining about caring for him and when there was a discussion about the high costs he was incurring, one family member said: 'Well, I have a feeling the problem will work itself out any day now.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, two nurses entered his room gossiping. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, Mr Haendel said the other responded: 'Don't worry, he can't hear you. He's brain dead, anyway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel thought: 'Holy s***, they think I'm brain dead? [I have to] let them know. During this time, I realized there was something scarier than death. I thought I might be stuck like this forever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. This caused 'locked in syndrome,' a coma in which a person is still conscious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3tYCFQIelKqSuNMP26QYDy"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on the podcast Blink: 'I just started to panic and freak out. Am I brain dead? Could it be? Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Immediately I'm on a mission. I [have to] let them know I'm not brain dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs and EEGs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14356349/first-recording-dying-human-brain-revealed-death.html"&gt;to determine brain function and activity&lt;/a&gt;, which showed a 'catastrophic' brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said: 'There was no possible way any neurologist thought I was with it at all. Vegetative at best. Disconnected from all reality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was experiencing 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said 'doctors didn't know what to do with me. I wasn't getting better but I wasn't dying either. It felt like I was stuck in limbo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, he was sent home to be cared for. It was then that Ellen began isolating her husband from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the little family she still allowed to visit, Ellen established a rigid care plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Mr Haendel's father was 45 minutes late for one of his care shifts, he and Ellen began yelling at each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel heard someone shouting 'You're strangling me! You're strangling me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said on Blink: 'Then I hear a bottle pop... like a two-liter Coke bottle [bouncing] off someone's head. Then I hear a human being tumbling down the stairs, crashing into the door and I hear my dad's mumbles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to say I heard "why did you do this to me?" and then I heard the door open and someone crawling out the door and the door pulled shut.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then heard Ellen calling 911, saying 'My father-in-law just tried to kill me. Tried to strangle me,' though Mr Haendel said he is almost certain the voice of the person who asked 'why did you do this to me?' was his father's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel added: 'And that's all I know. l did not see my father ever again or hear anything about him again or anyone in my family ever again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he detailed the incident on the Blink podcast, he has yet to reveal more details on anything following that event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he has detailed his recovery, which began when a doctor at Mass General Hospital in Boston noticed him make subtle movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said the doctor asked: 'Hey, do you guys see that? I think he’s moving something.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the doctor was dismissed and told the movements were involuntary.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said on TikTok: 'He told me that if I could hear him, I should try to move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I gathered every bit of strength I had and tensed my whole body — and it actually worked. It was the first real sign of hope.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors brought in a nonverbal speech therapist who taught him how to communicate via blinking, then use a letterboard, on which he spelled out 'I can hear you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, after intensive physical, occupational and speech therapy, he began to be able to move his neck and make primitive noises. Then came the use of his fingers and arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of 2020, Mr Haendel was able to move home and for the last four years has been continuing therapy and is now learning to walk with a cane.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'At the end of 2020, after years of hard work, I finally moved back home, though I still needed 24-hour care. Today, I’m still recovering, but I’ve come a long way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabies is caused by a virus present in the saliva of infected animals and is transmitted through contact with the virus. The disease affects the nervous systen and is deadly to humans once symptoms appear, according to Pinal County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinal County officials say animals infected with the disease may have a change in behavior, either by acting more aggressively or more tamed than usual. Animals may also appear agitated and excited or paralyzed and frightened, however some don't show any signs of illness before death from rabies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is recommended that people and pets avoid wild animals and not to "rescue" seemingly abandoned young wild animals. If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, wash the area with soap and water and go to the nearest emergency room for medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional information about rabies, visit the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;CDC's website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq4xtn002e5gm2xpfahtgo@published"&gt;My first pimple was a defining moment in my life. I recall feeling confused as to why something dreaded by teenagers was happening to me, a 9-year-old. That first pimple soon became my first breakout. From there, my skin never cleared up, despite spending a decade in and out of dermatology offices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5kxd000o3573snammxh9@published"&gt;During one of those doctor appointments, I was given antibiotics for my acne. According to my dermatologist, the constellation of zits that marred my face was likely an overgrowth of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acne&lt;/em&gt;. It’s well known that &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; play a key role in acne, so antibiotics to fight the bacterium seemed like the logical solution. We started with topical creams, which helped at first. Once those stopped working, potent oral antibiotics followed. No matter the treatment, the outcome was always the same: temporary improvement, only for the pimples to return with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l01000p35736v51j836@published"&gt;By my mid-20s, it was clear that the acne was more than a lingering symptom of puberty; it was a chronic condition. I was facing the harsh reality that modern skin care may never give me a clear complexion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l2m000q3573g2tfn2wq@published"&gt;That was also the time when I started my Ph.D. in food microbiology and was developing a deeper appreciation of bacterial systems. Naturally, I turned to examining my acne—and its refusal to leave my face—through the lens of a microbiologist. As it turns out, people blessed with healthy skin &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;have comparable amounts of the bacteria &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;to those with acne. The devil’s in the details when we examine strain-level differences: acne-prone individuals tend to have a greater diversity of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains—and that diversity includes more pathogenic strains.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l6p000r3573omjxbf2a@published"&gt;Much to my chagrin, I learned there is a link between &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains that are antibiotic-resistant are the same strains causing aggressive breakouts. This explains why antibiotics failed me time and time again: They selected for the resistant and hypervirulent strains of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt;. While they could briefly quell the bacterium on my face, the resistant strains just ended up taking over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l89000s35738e16s832@published"&gt;As a zit-faced grad student, I started a new research project that used lactic acid bacteria, or LAB, as a method for food safety. Basically, the idea was to explore how LAB could be used to colonize a food environment in order to prevent the outgrowth of spoilage or pathogenic bacteria. This is what’s known as a “protective culture”: we collaborate with good microbes in order to keep bad microbes—and foodborne illness—away. It’s the microbial approach to “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”; a strategic alliance that acknowledges not all bacteria are bad. Sometimes, we just want to create an environment with our &lt;em&gt;preferred&lt;/em&gt; microbial population.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lak000t357366fs772n@published"&gt;Spending long hours reading research on LAB amid a particularly disheartening breakout, I became fixated on the idea that the key to clearer skin lay in the strategic inclusion of beneficial bacteria through probiotics rather than the indiscriminate eradication of bacteria through broad-spectrum antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lct000u3573pfhn43p3@published"&gt;Assuming a bloom of virulent &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; was to blame, I hypothesized that recolonizing my skin microbiota with probiotic LAB could effectively treat my acne.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lfa000v35733z4hh6nn@published"&gt;It’s worth mentioning that LAB is an umbrella term for a group of bacteria that share certain characteristics, with the most notable being their ability to produce lactic acid. While &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/not-all-lactic-acid-bacteria-are-probiotics-but-some-are/9701ED42C873B008AF3F26F50132D2BF"&gt;not all LAB are classified as probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, LAB are the most commonly used probiotics in food products. In fact, yogurt, one of the most well-known probiotic foods, is a product of the LAB &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602395/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which convert lactose (the sugar in milk) into lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lhq000w35733bnd7oth@published"&gt;Given yogurt’s well-established ties to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2014.883356"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered if its probiotic effect was transferable to my skin microbiome. Interestingly, in 1912, a scientist named Dr. J. Peyri documented &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9318165/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the first topical probiotic studied for skin diseases in a paper titled “Topical Bacteriotherapy of the Skin.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lka000x3573c1y9t4mr@published"&gt;So, channeling Peyri, I embarked on a borderline socially unacceptable experiment where I smeared yogurt on my face in the name of science.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lmo000y3573bbf3yzz0@published"&gt;My approach was simple: I applied plain yogurt on my face twice a day for roughly a month. I stuck with plain yogurt, avoiding flavored products containing added sugars, due to the potential link &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666328722000281"&gt;between high-glycemic diets and acne&lt;/a&gt;. While I wasn’t particular about brands, my main criterion was that the label indicated “live cultures,” which means that each gram contained at least 10 million LAB cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lp1000z3573tr9gnl17@published"&gt;The results were outstanding. For the first time since childhood, I was acne-free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lrd00103573qquurnbp@published"&gt;I felt like I won the Nobel Prize for pimple science. Excited to share my findings with my sister-in-law, a fellow woman in STEM, I anticipated an enthusiastic discussion about microbiome science. Not wanting to burst my bubble, she gently informed me that &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr-Tiwari-7/publication/383976966_A_comprehensive_review_of_acne's_facial_impact_and_the_therapeutic_potential_of_Indian_herbal_medicine/links/66e2d88ff84dd1716ce7a02e/A-comprehensive-review-of-acnes-facial-impact-and-the-therapeutic-potential-of-Indian-herbal-medicine.pdf"&gt;yogurt face masks&lt;/a&gt; have been a natural remedy in India for generations. It turns out that what I saw as a microbiology breakthrough was just common sense in Ayurvedic practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lu400113573i9xtej07@published"&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/yogurt-face-mask"&gt;countless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://greatist.com/live/yogurt-for-face"&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; praise yogurt for its skin care benefits, citing everything from lactic acid’s gentle&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11055559/"&gt; exfoliation effects&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/8/12/703"&gt;probiotic properties&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/3/422"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; support these claims, showing that probiotics like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; can help with acne by producing antibacterial compounds that inhibit &lt;em&gt;C. acnes &lt;/em&gt;and by reducing inflammation. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.14971"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; out of Srinakharinwirot University’s Medical School found that a probiotic lotion derived from&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; decreased both the abundance of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; and inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne, with effects lasting up to four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Ironically, years of dermatology visits and pricey serums hadn’t managed what a $3 tub of yogurt did in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lys00133573io5dnoj4@published"&gt;Much like my first pimple was a defining moment in my childhood, my 20s were split into two eras: what I now call pre-yogurt face and post-yogurt face. Years later, I still apply yogurt to my face—though now, in maintenance mode, I do it just once or twice a week instead of twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5m1n00143573k862bg65@published"&gt;With my acne finally under control, my focus has shifted. Now in my 30s, I’m increasingly intrigued by the potential &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jocd.14734"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; of probiotics on skin health.&lt;/p&gt;

It ignited my interest in two emerging fields that are defining the future of medical science: food as medicine and microbiome therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5m6o00163573lz1y64xa@published"&gt;Both fields are emerging outside the traditional biopharma mold. Their intersection—where science meets people and where medicine meets food—is where I’ve found my calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States officially launched its "war on cancer" by signing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the National Cancer Act of 1971&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly, the intention was to spur research into the biology of cancer to better treat — and potentially cure — the disease. However, the nation has now been embroiled in this "war" for over 50 years, and we are nowhere closer to victory, argues &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" target="_blank" data-url="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nafis Hasan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer scientist and associate faculty member at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new book called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dlivescience-us-6922625869473866119-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Metastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons/dp/1945335181" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazon" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Metastasis: The Rise of the Cancer-Industrial Complex and the Horizons of Care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Common Notions, 2025), Hasan writes that cancer research has hyperfocused on finding treatments for individuals at the expense of driving down cancer rates overall. For example, in the passage below, he describes how a fixation on "somatic mutation theory" — which states that mutations in specific genes are the primary drivers of cancer — ignores the dangers of environmental carcinogens and the benefits of public health efforts in curbing cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 10 deadliest cancers, and why there's no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that cancer may be a hereditary disease can be traced back to the early twentieth century. Around 1900, the biologists Theodor Boveri and Walter Sutton rediscovered Gregor Mendel's laws of biological inheritance and proposed that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for inheriting biological traits. Boveri later proposed that a tumor cell arose when cell division went wrong and chromosomes were improperly distributed. In Boveri's view, "the problem of tumors is a cell problem." This was perhaps the first conceptualization of the "cancer cell," a lone culprit that could wreak havoc in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first experimental proof that cancer was potentially heritable came from Harvard scientist Ernest E. Tyzzer, who showed that the selective breeding of cancerous mice resulted in a disproportionately high rate of tumor incidence across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of cancer as a genetic disease was also advanced by the eugenics movement, which performed cancer research to assure racial "purity" in the twenties and thirties. For example, the widely used Pap smear test for cervical cancer was first &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presented at the Third Race Betterment Conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1928. Nazi Germany's research on smoking and lung cancer claimed that differential cancer rates between Jews and "Aryans" was due to blood (not workplace chemical exposures). The U.S. private sector also held exclusionary views, with DuPont refusing to hire workers with a family history of cancer, given the high rates of bladder cancer among dye workers. The scientist Carl Weller, following his discovery of retinoblastoma (a tumor of the eyes) in children, advocated that parents of children with retinoblastoma be sterilized. As late as 1956, Wilhelm Hueper, the first Director of the Environmental Cancer Section of the NCI [National Cancer Institute], suggested that Black workers would be most suitable to workplaces where exposures to carcinogenic chemicals were unavoidable given their alleged resistance to the carcinogenic action of coal tar, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UV radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and petroleum derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists pushed back on these narratives of racial traits and cancer incidence. For instance, the notion that West Africans were racially predisposed to higher rates of liver cancer lost credibility when Japanese immigrants to the U.S. suffered the same type of cancer — the cause turned out to be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aflatoxins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [toxins produced by fungi that can end up on various crops] in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;discovery of DNA's double helix structure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the fifties generated momentum for molecular biology, but the field did not concern itself with the cancer problem until the late seventies. Many molecular biologists were skeptical of government-sponsored research and worried they would lose their independence and be pushed to find cancer-causing viruses. Ironically, institutional support from the Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) later laid the foundations for the resurgence of a molecular theory of carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resurgence was driven by the SVCP director, Robert Huebner. Huebner was inspired by French studies showing that bacterial genes could remain in a repressed state and proposed the "oncogene theory" of carcinogenesis. In short, he believed there were cancer-causing genes that just needed to be identified. He previously confirmed that certain viruses gave rise to tumors in hamsters but wanted to dive deeper into how this happened. He suspected that viral genes were responsible for initiating tumors in the hamsters and, as the manager of SVCP's annual $10 million budget, he had the resources and authority to pour money into molecular cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early seventies, Huebner awarded millions of dollars to both private contractors and public institutions to study the molecular actions of viruses suspected of causing cancers in humans. However, by 1974, the White House's proposed budget for the NIH [National Institutes of Health] included three times as much funding for private contractors as for traditional research grants. The use of contract work was so extensive that by 1976, SVCP project officers worked in private contractor buildings (e.g., at Meloy Laboratories, Microbiological Associates, and Flow Laboratories). Huebner's largesse towards private contractors became a focal point of attack by molecular biologists suffering from financial precarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-left inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Nafis Hasan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of Nafis Hasan)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Watson (of Watson and Crick fame) established a virus cancer laboratory in 1968 and was appointed to the National Cancer Advisory Board in 1972, despite his objections to the War on Cancer. Molecular biologists like Watson posed an "anti-communist critique" of the War on Cancer by contending that government meddling in their disciplines stifled their freedom. Watson wanted to make molecular biology a major recipient of NIH and NCI funding, but without the government directing the research. He advocated for his friend, Norton Zinder, to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead a committee to investigate the work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the VCP in 1974. [The Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) was later called just the Virus Cancer Program (VCP).]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Zinder Report was the nail in the coffin for the VCP, which was already under pressure from Congress for its inability to produce results about cancer-causing viruses or vaccines to fight them. While Watson and other molecular biologists decried the use of contracts and the VCP's goals, they readily used VCP funds and infrastructure to continue their own research. In fact, VCP infrastructure supported oncogene theory all the way to its final iteration, the somatic mutation theory (SMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT postulates that cancer is caused by mutations that either permanently activate or repress genes. The first validation came in 1976 with the discovery of gene &lt;em&gt;src &lt;/em&gt;in normal human cells. Continued VCP support allowed researchers at the University of California, San Francisco to grow, develop, and hone the technique of molecular hybridization, which would be instrumental in detecting the&lt;em&gt; src&lt;/em&gt; gene in human cells. By the late seventies, molecular biologists and viral cancer researchers had cataloged several viral genes suspected of causing human cancers. However, absolute proof of human gene involvement in carcinogenesis was still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until 1982 that Robert Weinberg would find the missing link — using hybridization probes, he showed the presence of &lt;em&gt;v-ras&lt;/em&gt; in a human bladder cancer tissue specimen. In 1983, SMT was further boosted by the discovery of proteins involved in carcinogenesis. All these discoveries and advancements — hybridization probes, viral gene catalogs, and purified proteins from viruses — were products of the VCP's financial and material infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT eventually surpassed viral carcinogenesis theory as the leading theory of carcinogenesis and gained social and institutional acceptance (e.g., the prestigious Lasker Awards &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" target="_blank" data-url="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;went to oncogene researchers in 1982&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Vincent DeVita, the Director of the NCI under Reagan, recommitted the Institute's budget to genetic research and further cut the environmental carcinogen testing program. The discovery of oncogenes and related proteins also opened a new arena for cancer therapies and fueled pharmaceutical industry interest in collaborations with universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most scientific retellings of this history suggest that the shift from environmental carcinogens to viruses and, ultimately, to individuals' genes happened in the vacuum of universal knowledge creation. Nevertheless, a confluence of neoliberalism, libertarian ideology, and government policy cemented the idea that genes are responsible for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat problematically, experimental evidence indisputably determined that genetic fragments found in cancerous cells are also found in normal cells. However, the explanation for this fact was constructed by social and political forces. As early as 1975, the American Business Cancer Research Foundation, funded largely by the chemical industry, tried to shift the focus away from prevention and towards identifying the "underlying mechanism." The Reagan administration was more than happy to advance these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologists, who once decried the VCP's use of contracts, were more than happy to participate in private-public collaborations that directed money to their labs. Some had even publicly cautioned against environmental regulations when the NCI, under the previous Carter administration, moved to increase funding for environmental carcinogenesis research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT renewed the biomedical settlement — a commitment to treating diseases instead of preventing them. It also facilitated the real subsumption of academic research under capitalism and, consequently, an explosive growth of the cancer drug market and capital accumulation by the biotech and pharma industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this line of attack in the War on Cancer has had few meaningful outcomes for cancer patients. After more than four decades since the discovery of the first oncogene, Robert Weinberg candidly reflected on his discovery of &lt;em&gt;ras&lt;/em&gt;: "The greatest decreases in cancer-associated mortality have come from reductions in disease incidence [prevention] rather than treatment, such as the therapies that some anticipated would flow directly from RAS research."&lt;/p&gt;

But this is no longer the case,” said professor Nick Steel, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decreases-in-life-expectancy"&gt;Decreases in life expectancy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 2011, lower death rates from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-worsens-cardiovascular-health-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt; and cancers steadily increased average life expectancy across the continent. But the study found that between 2011 and 2019, progress stagnated as major risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol either rose or stopped improving in virtually all European nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of the reduction in life expectancy improvements between 2011–19. Unsurprisingly, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-fell-sharply-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Covid pandemic&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for decreases in life expectancy seen between 2019–21,” explained Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers highlight that while improved treatments for high cholesterol and blood pressure have helped, they haven’t offset the harmful effects of increasingly unhealthy lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic further eroded longevity figures after 2019, the concern is that people may begin dying younger unless governments take robust action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-policies-targeting-health-risks"&gt;Government policies targeting health risks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 19 European countries studied, England showed the sharpest reduction in life expectancy growth following 2011, a trend mirrored to varying degrees in the rest of the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, some nations, including Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium, managed better resilience. They also had stronger policies targeting health risks and a more favorable record in controlling major cardiovascular threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, England and the other UK nations fared worst after 2011 and also during the Covid pandemic, and experienced some of the highest risks for heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including poor diets,” Steel said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that stronger government policies are needed to reduce major health risks including obesity, poor diet, and low physical activity – to improve population health over the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-human-life-expectancy-still-improve"&gt;Can human life expectancy still improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emphasizes that rising longevity is still possible. “Life expectancy for older people in many countries is still improving, showing that we have not yet reached a natural longevity ceiling,” Steel explained. By focusing on preventing early deaths – chiefly among younger adults – there is ample room to reduce mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are a cause for concern especially here in the UK, but also some hope,” said John Newton, a scientist at the European Center for Environment and Human Health at the &lt;a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should be concerned because many European countries including the UK are showing such poor progress but hopeful because addressing the underlying causes of major illnesses appears to be effective if only improvements in the key risks can be sustained.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-urgent-need-for-action"&gt;Urgent need for action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Price, National Director of Public Health at &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHS England&lt;/a&gt;, said the findings highlight a need for stronger measures to tackle cardiovascular disease and cancer at their roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The slowdown in life expectancy improvements, particularly due to cardiovascular disease and cancer, highlights the urgent need for stronger action on the root causes – poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the NHS offers weight management programs and widespread blood pressure checks to curb these conditions, Price emphasized that government intervention is crucial to address the broader societal drivers of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. “We cannot treat our way out of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/childhood-obesity-rates-are-surging-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; crisis, and we need to stem it at source,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reversing-the-human-life-expectancy-trend"&gt;Reversing the human life expectancy trend&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study found that while the European public enjoyed steady life expectancy gains for decades, those gains have lately diminished – mostly due to unhealthy diets, lack of exercise, and the pandemic’s toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, reversing this trend depends on decisive actions, from healthier lifestyle promotion to better policy frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, a coordinated public health response that prioritizes dietary changes, physical activity, and tackling obesity may help restore the upward curve in life expectancy. Otherwise, Europe’s younger generations risk shorter lifespans than those who came before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(25)00009-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBzYzMwVTBiWk5QZmdPdHNhcnlMRGRVeWtXaTd4ZzFZNzdhVWFqbUVzVmRpblpBa1ExVWwzZFBObnMzandzN2NWTjFiQWFjM0FQOVRWdFRTcDRQN1hmUmZTR3o0aUJ0VjI5Y3J0UlRPaEVLbFZidnAyWlNZYw</guid></item><item><title>New FDA-Approved Diabetes Drug Slashes Heart Attack and Stroke Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPVE5nckY5WFY3d0dzd19aSWNSa0lpRU9uSGgyOXc3aHE3NFp1MzVOTGxCMTRGYTA5NmlNWDNpOGxsRWlYVWhyS29hOFRUcmhTSVJObmt4LWRXOEZDT1ZNNmlWWXB6MFFTa0NzbzlpTjRyc2o4UUJTU3BFNGtMc25seWdOZl9lQ055X2dxNVJvUE9ueGRPakR5ZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPVE5nckY5WFY3d0dzd19aSWNSa0lpRU9uSGgyOXc3aHE3NFp1MzVOTGxCMTRGYTA5NmlNWDNpOGxsRWlYVWhyS29hOFRUcmhTSVJObmt4LWRXOEZDT1ZNNmlWWXB6MFFTa0NzbzlpTjRyc2o4UUJTU3BFNGtMc25seWdOZl9lQ055X2dxNVJvUE9ueGRPakR5ZQ</guid></item><item><title>What Is HKU5-CoV-2?

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a virus that can enter human cells in a similar way to the virus that causes COVID-19. But the germ — HKU5-CoV-2 — doesn’t enter cells as effectively, so experts caution the findings shouldn’t be “overblown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China described the virus and potential treatments for infections in the journal &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" aria-label="Cell"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is a virus found in bats. It’s a type of coronavirus, a large group of germs that can affect mammals and birds. Some have passed from animals to humans, like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Some coronaviruses cause mild symptoms in humans, while others can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists study viruses like HKU5-CoV-2 to find out how they work and how readily they might pass to humans. The Wuhan Institute researchers tested the newly-discovered germ in test tubes and models of the human gut and airways to investigate its transmission potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the virus’s spike protein was able to bind with the membrane of human cells via a receptor enzyme that sits on their surface. This protein has a feature called a “furin cleavage site” that helps it latch on to the receptor enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is HKU5-CoV-2 A Threat To Humans?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential transmission pathway is similar to that of the highly-contagious SARS-CoV-2. But although it was better adapted to human cells than certain other similar viruses, HKU5-CoV-2 did not infect human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2. In fact, it was significantly worse at binding to human cells, among other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, scientists have urged caution over the results. The researchers themselves wrote in their study that the “risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Osterholm told &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" aria-label="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; the reaction to the research was “overblown.” He said it was also possible that increased immunity to similar viruses could help protect the public from another &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" target="_self" aria-label="pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite these calls for caution, the news appears to have boosted shares in the manufacturers behind vaccines for &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" target="_self" aria-label="COVID-19"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Shares of Pfizer, Moderna and Novovax rose on Friday following the news, according to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" aria-label="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Might HKU5-CoV-2 Be Treated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a bat virus like HKU5-CoV-2 infect a human, the researchers said monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs might help treat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiviral drugs are designed to stop the spread of virus around the body, potentially easing symptoms and shortening illness. They’re used to treat a range of illnesses, including flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in labs to target a wide range of illnesses, including cancer. They have been tailored to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, for example, to try and prevent it from infecting human cells — a treatment that’s especially important for people with weak immune systems who may not gain strong protection from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be highly effective treatments, but their efficacy for COVID-19 varies depending on the variant a patient contracts. So scientists had to develop new monoclonal antibody treatments quickly to try and keep up with the mutating virus.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — As the popularity of keeping backyard and urban chicken flocks grows, health and agriculture experts warn that bird flu can pose a risk to your feathered friends — and by extension, a small risk to you, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates vary on how many people have backyard chickens. But the number, regardless of who does the count, is significant. In 2023, an &lt;a href="https://americanpetproducts.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Pet Products Association&lt;/a&gt;'s pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That's especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/section/homegarden/baltimoreans-embrace-backyard-chicken-raising-trend/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Baltimore Magazine&lt;/a&gt; put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How bird flu spreads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that's the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/media/pdfs/2024/07/avian-flu-transmission.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC emphasizes that "no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting yourself if you have chickens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/caring/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;guide for backyard flock owners&lt;/a&gt; offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wear protective equipment around sick or dead birds, including safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't touch your protective gear until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never wear used personal protective equipment in your home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When cleaning and disinfecting, don't stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you're done, toss the protective equipment or clean it properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cats and dogs at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:18:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxObnh2M2VQRXptd3NTQlAwSjVJVHhFaXZPeXJBam1vS2VFUHY0d0QtRVNGYmdVMTE5S2NLQUdUTkZOZFR4bS1xLTd6N2dkdzlwZF9jcGdYUGtrZ18zcmlFdXpYOXdBVGpxWWxQQzlvcmZ2VkxZMjI5WnFEb0E4dVl6dE9iSHIwcm5YNVdrcjRyWFZsbkZHQi1hTXhOaG1iQ09FLThN</guid></item><item><title>Who is in charge of health care?

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Dannielle Wright hoped to get her life back on track by seeking treatment for her depression. Then, her doctor and insurance company could not agree on the best medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her case highlights a fundamental question about health care in the United States: Who is in charge — doctors or insurance companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her insurance provider, &lt;a href="https://www.molinahealthcare.com/"&gt;Molina Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, has four times denied coverage of an antidepressant medication prescribed by her doctor, Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright, 32, said she has struggled with mental illness her entire life. She decided in December she wanted to restart antidepressants after experiencing negative side effects from medication three years prior. Her doctor’s office gave her a genetic test that indicated potential adverse reactions from all medications except the one her insurer won’t cover, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“Lesser cost alternatives may be available, including mere observation, or, where appropriate, no medical treatment at all,” a Feb. 7 letter from Molina Healthcare states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molina Healthcare maintains that genetic tests do not confirm whether a patient will be nonresponders to a particular drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never had insurance shut me down so blatantly,” Wright said. “I’m not the only one, but I can’t stop feeling like it’s intentional. There have been so many hard days where I know if Molina had just given me that antidepressant, it would have started working by now, and I could start getting my life back in order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molina Healthcare did not respond to multiple requests for comment before The Columbian’s deadline. However, in a separate Feb. 4 letter to Wright, the health care company states Wright must first try and fail treatment with two preferred drugs — duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor) — before it would cover desvenlafaxine succinate (Pristiq), the antidepressant her genetic test indicated would be the safest option.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content has-sidebar-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="d-flex d-lg-block flex-column mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;aside class="float-lg-left mr-lg-5 order-last"&gt;
					&lt;div class="article-inline photo my-6"&gt;&lt;figure class="mx-auto mb-0"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1018250484-molina-health-care_2.12_TB02-768x579.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" data-enlarge="https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1018250484-molina-health-care_2.12_TB02.jpg" data-photo-page="https://www.columbian.com/media/item/1018250484-molina-health-care_2-12_tb02/" data-disable-purchase="false" alt="Taylor Balkom/The Columbian (Taylor Balkom/The Columbian)"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption border-bottom border-light pb-3 buy-photo"&gt;

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“As you may be aware, the American Psychiatric Association does not recognize these genetic tests for initial medication selection,” Molina Healthcare wrote Feb. 4. “These genetic tests demonstrate how a patient metabolizes a drug, but does not confirm they will be ‘non-responders’ to certain medications. Your doctor must show you failed a trial of two preferred drugs. Or your doctor must show why the preferred drugs are not right for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said she has appealed the decision with Molina multiple times since the company’s original denial came in January, but it continues to impose step-therapy: a health care policy that requires patients to try less expensive medications before covering a medication that costs more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pharmacy lists Pristiq at about $370 for a 30-day supply without insurance, but prices elsewhere are listed around $570 a month. Duloxetine, available as a generic, costs about $10 a month, and venlafaxine ranges up to $135, depending on the dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, step-therapy and similar strategies can create administrative burdens aimed at steering patients and physicians to an insurer’s preferred treatment, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067323/"&gt;according to a study from the National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Wright plans to file a complaint with the Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner, a small agency of about 280 employees who oversee the insurance market statewide. The agency has the authority to investigate complaints about a patient’s insurance company or agent and propose laws when consumer protections are needed, &lt;a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/what-we-do"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Marquis, public affairs director for the insurance commissioner’s office, said there are no regulations that require insurers to consider genetic testing when determining prescription coverage. However, a new bill this legislative session could change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1425%20HBA%20HCW%2025.pdf?q=20250215150313"&gt;House Bill 1425&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, would require coverage of pharmacogenetic testing for psychotropic medication, which includes antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If passed, health plans — including health plans offered to public employees and through Medicaid — issued or renewed on or after Jan. 1, 2026, must provide coverage for pharmacogenetic testing. Health plans, the Health Care Authority and Medicaid managed care organizations would not be able to impose prior authorization or step-therapy requirements to this form of testing, according to the proposed bill.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content has-sidebar-content container px-lg-7"&gt;

				&lt;/aside&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Wright is insured through Washington’s Medicaid program, Apple Health, but she began coverage with Molina Healthcare in 2024 as a supplemental insurance because it covered a wider range of health care providers in Clark County, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, Wright was happy with her decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every single day in February has been spent fighting with Molina. The genetic test gave the result that Cymbalta and Effexor would not work for me,” Wright said. “At worst, it will hurt or kill me. At best, it just doesn’t do anything. I have been on medications in my past that have nearly killed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tug-of-war&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental health has been a struggle for Wright since she was 5 years old, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a yearslong battle with depression and anxiety, Wright has polycystic ovary syndrome, known as PCOS, a chronic condition that causes irregular periods, excess hair growth, weight gain and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;

						
				&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Wright’s previous provider at Rosewood Family Health Center — a medical clinic in Portland — conducted a genetic test through the company GeneSight after trying a combination of psychiatric medications without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeneSight analyzes how a person’s genes may affect their response to medications commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety, ADHD and other mental health conditions, &lt;a href="https://genesight.com/product/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=performance-max&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA2cu9BhBhEiwAft6IxJzAoGuASjhGrdn0nuaURGdRXbDNBoGQQfI1NLzMZ8YPANjcF9J5IRoCopYQAvD_BwE"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Wright decided she wanted to try an antidepressant medication when she noticed a rapid decline in her mental health. Wright forwarded the genetic test to her new provider, Dr. Andriana Siefe at Legacy Health, and together, they decided she would benefit from an SSRI or SNRI antidepressant, in addition to regular therapy appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are a class of medications commonly used to treat depression and other mental health conditions. While SNRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, work by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 29, Siefe wrote a letter advocating on behalf of Wright after coverage for the medication was first denied by Molina Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With psychiatric medications, often we have historically done a trial and error approach where patients have had to try multiple medications before figuring out the ones that work best for them,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siefe said it is well known in medicine that if a patient’s family member does well on a medication, that patient is much more likely to do well on it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This just shows the genetic component of these choices of medication, and why it is such a gift that with modern testing we can know which medication is likely to do best with her genetics,” Siefe wrote. “This area of study is called pharmacogenetics and is likely to be the future of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;But Molina Healthcare does not view genetic testing as a valid measure for initial medication selection, according to its letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing is being marketed and used for a variety of reasons, including confirming or ruling out a suspected genetic condition, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/genetic-testing-to-improve-psychiatric-medication"&gt;according to the APA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is also being marketed to improve the selection of medication for mental illness, such as depression,” the APA said on its website. “However, several recent expert reviews caution that while it holds much potential, the evidence does not yet show genetic testing is effective in improving psychiatric medication choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Siefe disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siefe wrote that she finds it very troubling that Wright’s insurance company requires the two medications (duloxetine and venlafaxine) to be tried prior to trying the recommended medication based on her genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“If we have objective data reporting that it is contraindicated to trial two medications, it goes against my oath as a physician to subject my patient to trying serious side effects that may not work well,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who has the final say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the insurance commissioner’s office, when a patient’s health insurance rejects a treatment or a bill dispute, that doesn’t have to be the final word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients have the option to file an appeal to their insurance provider, but if the answer is still no, they can file another appeal with an independent review organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health insurance company cannot change, reduce or stop benefits for an ongoing course of treatment without providing you advance notice and an opportunity for review, &lt;a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/appealing-health-insurance-denial"&gt;according to the insurance commissioner’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;But Wright believes Molina Healthcare should not have been able to dismiss genetic testing within its denial in the first place — as does Siefe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I sincerely hope that insurances will start to consistently acknowledge the validity of these tests and then respect the patient/doctor combined decisions on best medications especially in psychiatric medicine,” Siefe wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insurance roadblocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claim denials by insurance companies were highlighted by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html"&gt;national media outlets&lt;/a&gt; following the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO Brian Thompson, which sparked further discussion about patient autonomy and the quality of the United States health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an analysis of federal health care data by &lt;a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/health-insurance-claim-denials-and-appeals"&gt;ValuePenguin&lt;/a&gt;, UnitedHealthcare and Molina Healthcare were among the top 10 companies with the highest claim denial rates.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare had a 33 percent denial rate, while Molina Healthcare followed closely behind with a 26 percent denial rate, according to the December report by ValuePenguin that analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente and Providence Health Plan were among insurers with the lowest denial rates. Kaiser has a 6 percent denial rate, while Providence had a 4 percent denial rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power, published a series of articles in 2022 called “&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/uncovered"&gt;Uncovered&lt;/a&gt;” that shed light on insurers’ rejections of millions of claims every year in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/evicore-health-insurance-denials-cigna-unitedhealthcare-aetna-prior-authorizations"&gt;One article in the series&lt;/a&gt; uncovered that many of the country’s largest insurers delegate medical reviews to EviCore, a company that determines whether to approve care for more than 100 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;While data on insurers’ claim denials remains limited, ProPublica found available government figures indicate that insurers reject between 10 percent and 20 percent of submitted claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what information it has released, experts say, is so crude, inconsistent and confusing that it’s essentially meaningless,” ProPublica said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Keep fighting’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said throughout the denial process with Molina Healthcare, she’s been leaning on her partner, Jacob Christensen, writing down her feelings and finding comfort within online gaming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I tend to hyperfocus on my comforts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Wright files a complaint with the insurance commissioner’s office, she wants to go one step further and request an external review of her case.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;section class="article-content container px-lg-7"&gt;
			&lt;div class="mx-lg-7 px-lg-5 px-xl-7"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;External reviews are performed by independent review organizations that aren’t affiliated with an insurance company. The review can either uphold or overturn the insurance company’s position, according to the insurance commissioner’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an independent review organization considers an appeal, that decision is final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Wright wants to advocate for change within the health insurance industry. She wants others who find themselves in a similar situation with an insurance company to know that they should keep fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to change things. I am going to change things. It is angering because it feels like Molina is intentionally dehumanizing and depersonalizing me,” Wright said. “It feels like they just want me to continue to be depressed until I just give in and die.”
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Her maternal grandmother was only 35 when she died of breast cancer. Meyer said her fear was diminished, but not eradicated, when she tested negative for the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;BRCA genetic mutations &lt;/a&gt;that cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5D6ETB2L5BQNBFWS4MLFN4BWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her health, fitness and diet were priorities. A vegetarian who doesn’t touch junk food and walks at least three miles a day, Meyer was proud of her low cholesterol and blood pressure readings. “I’ll walk up seven flights of stairs instead of taking an elevator,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OIYIG6IRVBHTRIPXAPYCIYS55I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So in the spring of 2023 when she developed a dry cough sometimes accompanied by wheezing, without a precursor cold or other respiratory infection, she assumed it would go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4EWIJODJIZF4NAUYOGKRPVHQ5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4M6CX74TEFCMBMG6CKCUN4MICQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After about three months Meyer consulted her longtime internist who ordered a chest X-ray which was normal.

She felt fine otherwise and had not missed a day of teaching.

Meyer said she coughed through the appointment and told the new doctor she was occasionally short of breath. The doctor ordered a standard &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=Transthoracic%20echocardiogram%2C%20also%20called%20a,or%20tear%20in%20the%20esophagus." target="_blank"&gt;echocardiogram, &lt;/a&gt;an ultrasound test that traces blood flow through the heart and its valves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MSHUTNDWO5ARHNCPDA32JPDE7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The echo, the geriatrician told Meyer, looked “fantastic” and uncovered no abnormalities.

Yet, it’s estimated that up to 16% of American adults have symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833208/reasons-you-cant-poop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, which is partially defined as having less than three bowel movements per week. And trouble going comfortably only becomes more prevalent with age. Dealing with constipation can be painful and frustrating. The good news? You can help reduce symptoms of constipation by making a few tweaks to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to make going #2 a more pleasant experience? We spoke with two registered dietitians who explained why navy beans are the best bean to help you poop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Navy Beans Are the Best Beans to Help You Poop  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loaded with Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the white bean family, navy beans are small, oval-shaped beans that pack an impressive amount of fiber. One cup of cooked navy beans provides a whopping 19 grams of fiber, or 55 to 86% of your daily recommended fiber intake, depending on your age and gender. Recall having a smooth toilet trip after eating baked beans? This could be why!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping things moving along smoothly in your digestive tract, navy beans' high fiber content slows down digestion, which helps you feel full for longer and minimizes spikes in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289532/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-2000-calories/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7-Day High Fiber Meal Plan: 2,000 Calories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;7-Day High Fiber Meal Plan: 2,000 Calories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains Soluble and Insoluble Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans are an excellent choice for staying regular because they contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:both soluble and insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;both soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;. “Soluble fiber helps with bowel movement by absorbing water, swelling to a gel-like form that softens the stools. Insoluble fiber helps add bulk to the stool and aids in the removal,” explains &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, cardiology dietitian and owner of Entirely Nourished. She adds, “Having both of these fibers [also] helps support healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports Gut Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans’ high fiber content also contributes to a healthier gut microbiome. “Specifically, navy beans have a high content of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289676/what-is-resistant-starch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:resistant starch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;, a type of carbohydrate that isn’t digested in the small intestine,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-gervacio-900a1484/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Catherine Gervacio, BS, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Catherine Gervacio, BS, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, “resistant starch becomes a source of food for bacteria (a prebiotic) in the large intestine, and in turn, the beneficial bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that may have anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body,” Gervacio adds. Specifically, these short-chain fatty acids may help maintain a healthy gut lining and prevent harmful substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains Magnesium, a Natural Laxative&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8012002/can-magnesium-help-you-poop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is a common ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives. Navy beans are an excellent source of this essential mineral, providing 23% of the daily recommended intake per cup.  Magnesium has been shown to help relieve occasional constipation by drawing water into the colon to keep things moving. It also helps relax intestinal muscles, making it easier for waste to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Enjoy Navy Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy beans, dried and canned varieties, are affordable and versatile and can be added to a wide variety of dishes, like stews and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/creamy-white-chili-with-sweet-potatoes-white-beans-8718974" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chilis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chilis&lt;/a&gt;. For Gervacio, nothing beats adding beans to a creamy, hearty bowl of soup, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939867/creamy-white-bean-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Creamy White Bean Soup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Creamy White Bean Soup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248881/chicken-white-bean-soup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chicken &amp;amp; White Bean Soup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; White Bean Soup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also think outside the soup pot. Here are a few easy ways to use up a can of navy beans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips to Keep You Regular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping regularly requires more than just eating navy beans. Here are additional strategies to help keep things moving:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a variety of high-fiber foods&lt;/strong&gt;. Navy beans are just one of many fiber-containing foods. To get more nutrients in your diet it’s important to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods, including whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other bean varieties, including black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils and split peas are also brimming with fiber and health benefits. Just be aware that as great as fiber is, the amount also matters—eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:too much fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;too much fiber&lt;/a&gt; can lead to gas and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink plenty of fluids&lt;/strong&gt;. Staying hydrated helps make stools soft and easier to pass. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How much water you need;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;How much water you need&lt;/a&gt; depends on your activity level, body size, gender, health status, and environment. Generally speaking, women need 91 ounces and men need 125 ounces of fluids daily. Have trouble remembering to drink water? Using a water tracking app on your phone or keeping a water bottle with you throughout the day can make it easier to meet your goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-start-to-poop-better-8772811" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Staying physically active;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Staying physically active&lt;/a&gt; can help relieve constipation by strengthening intestinal muscles and helping move food faster through the gut. Aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Riding a bike, swimming, jogging, playing tennis, mowing the lawn, gardening and going for a brisk walk all count towards your weekly activity goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain medications, supplements and health conditions can cause or worsen constipation. If you’re concerned about your bowel habits, it’s important to talk with your healthcare provider. They can review your medical history and make changes to your care plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one food alone can resolve your toilet troubles, navy beans are an excellent source of nutrients, like fiber and magnesium, that may provide some relief. Eating a variety of high-fiber foods, drinking plenty of water and staying active can also help keep you regular. If you’re working on upping your fiber game, just make sure to increase fiber in your diet slowly to minimize symptoms like gas or bloating.

Soluble fiber is the key. It dissolves in water and then forms like a gel in the stomach, slowing digestion. Insoluble fiber helps move food through your digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F7UB2WDMDRA2LKD27PIK4ZDKXM"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;BERBERINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P4UQWKQV3NEZTNSE3D3YEKQA7A"&gt;Do a quick Google search for berberine and you will come across a handful of interesting headlines referring to it as “nature’s Ozempic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5U6BLC5SSZDELJXVERFE6Z235M"&gt;And considering the rising popularity of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs, that is bound to catch folks’ attention.

                        &lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman takes &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt;, an ingredient found in pain relievers like Tylenol, Excedrin, and Panadol, her &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen#:~:text=Despite%20acetaminophen's%20classification%20as%20low,spectrum%20disorder%2C%20the%20researchers%20noted." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;unborn child could develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published Feb. 6 in Nature Mental Health reported by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UW News&lt;/a&gt;, the findings suggest that doctors should reconsider prescribing medications with acetaminophen to mothers during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research shows that upward of 70% of pregnant women use acetaminophen during pregnancy to control pain or reduce fever. The drug, which is the active ingredient of many pain-relief medications, is one of the few considered safe to take during pregnancy by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National News:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/national/alabama-house-expedites-medicaid-for-pregnant-women-joining-other-states-with-high-mortality-rates/4046181"&gt;Alabama House expedites Medicaid for pregnant women, joining other states with high mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient for pain relief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient in over 600 different medications, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC). Vicodin, Percocet, and Tylenol with Codeine are also over-the-counter medicines containing the pain reliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen,” Brennan Baker, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, told UW News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is often &lt;a href="https://www.bemedwise.org/health-research-and-reports/health-resources-and-toolkits/acetaminophen/acetaminophen-containing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;used to treat&lt;/a&gt; mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, and toothaches, and to reduce fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA,” Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a UW Medicine pediatrician, told UW News. “Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;p&gt;The children born to 300 mothers who agreed to give blood samples during pregnancy were followed for 8 to 10 years. Among the women who did not use acetaminophen during pregnancy, the rate of ADHD was 9%, but for the women who used acetaminophen, the ADHD rate was 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New study suggests higher risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite acetaminophen’s classification as low risk by regulatory agencies such as the FDA, new evidence suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and adverse outcomes, like ADHD and ADHD autism spectrum disorder, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association was stronger among daughters than sons, with the daughters of acetaminophen-exposed mothers showing a 6.16 times higher likelihood of ADHD while the association was weaker and nonsignificant in males. Researchers did not know why the association was stronger in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker said mothers are often told to use acetaminophen, the primary agent in Tylenol, instead of ibuprofen, which is more likely to affect the fetal kidney or heart adversely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Acetaminophen) is really the only option to control fever or pain during pregnancy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be more research to figure out if some women can tolerate acetaminophen during pregnancy with no ill effects on the fetus while others cannot, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is obviously more work that needs to be done in this area,” Baker explained. “And we need to continually update our guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;postponed&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Blood tests on 150 veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm?s_cid=mm7405a2_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-face-the-nation-transcript-02-16-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1kU21VcVJXSXdxa0JTaTJzN0JlWHRVWjFGMGFKTjJ6RnJRU3BzbDlhekdHRkV6UnhJRE1iTndhaXc5VEloTVNsWmp2MV9aR2ZnUWR0YVExQ3hRUzJQa0R5aDBBWFA4UjdsS1VQYXhFOThBbHUtd01j</guid></item><item><title>Do You Always Remember Your Dreams?

              &lt;p&gt;How frequently do you remember dreams? Have you ever woken up knowing you’ve dreamed but been unable to recall the details? It turns out that the ability to remember a dream might be influenced by a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy spent the past four years studying “morning dream recall,” as it’s termed, publishing their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in the journal&lt;em&gt; Communications Psychology.&lt;/em&gt; Their work explores how various traits and behaviors seemingly influence our ability to remember our dreams when we wake up. Understanding the dynamics of morning dream recall has significant implications for studying dreaming as a whole—a mysterious brain function that continues to evade precise scientific understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,” lead author Giulio Bernardi, a psychologist from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073502"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernardi and his colleagues studied over 200 participants between the ages of 18 and 70. The researchers asked the participants to record their dreams and to wear a sleep monitoring wristwatch for a 15-day period. Before and after this period, participants completed tests and questionnaires on various personal topics, including their interest in dreams, tendency toward distraction, and anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers observed a wide range of morning dream recall abilities among participants, along with several potential influencing factors. For example, people with a self-reported positive view on dreams and a tendency to daydream remembered their dreams more frequently. The seasons seemed to play a role as well, as there was an overall higher rate of dream recall during the spring across participants as opposed to during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;People who spent more time in light sleep, as well as young people in general, were also more likely to remember their dreams. Older people, on the other hand, more often woke up with the feeling they’d dreamt, but were unable to remember the dream—a phenomenon the researchers called “white dreams.” Interestingly, their “observations support the notion that white dreams represent actual dream experiences, with memories of their content fading upon waking,” they wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Data collected within this project will serve as a reference for future comparisons with clinical populations,” said Valentina Elce, first author of the study and a PhD student in cognitive, computational, and social neurosciences also at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca. “This will allow us to move forward the research on the pathological alterations of dreaming and their potential prognostic and diagnostic value.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasizing that dreams are self-reported, making the study vulnerable to biases. However, Bernardi, Elce, and their colleagues’ identification of potential influences on morning dream recall nevertheless sheds light on a mysterious brain function that has captivated humanity for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sarah Blackburn wanted peace of mind. Instead, she got an appointment to have her spleen removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRKvXB/"&gt;now-viral TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn recounts how she and her husband booked full-body MRIs at Prenuvo, a medical imaging company known for its early detection scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-full-body-mri-reveals-an-unpleasant-surprise"&gt;A full-body MRI reveals an unpleasant surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scheduled to have them done in Dallas, which is about four hours away from us in Houston, and we were gonna make a trip out of it and we were so excited,” she said. But after some hesitation (“maybe we don’t really wanna know”), they canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Eight months later, she finally went through with it at the new Houston location. “I was treating it like a spa day. I was so excited and like taking pictures in my little scrubs,” she said, raving about the experience. “Everything at Prenuvo was great. I got to watch Netflix, and the waiting room was nice and everything was super pretty and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also expecting a clean bill of health. Instead, she got a late-night results email that sent her into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shocking-diagnosis"&gt;The shocking diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn received her results four days later at 8:30pm. “I had nobody to call,” she said. Her follow-up with a nurse practitioner was scheduled within 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime, she panicked. “I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The report? “One in three mortality rate,” she recalled. “Like OK, thank you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo had found an aneurysm on her splenic artery, a discovery that quickly escalated after further testing. “I got a CT scan. There are actually two aneurysms inside of my splenic artery.” Yikes. The solution? “Now I am getting my spleen removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-internet-reacts"&gt;The internet reacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters had a lot to say about Blackburn’s experience. Some shared how Prenuvo scans helped ease their own health anxieties. “I got it done and I have health anxiety and they didn’t find anything and it really helped my anxiety going forward,” one user wrote, to which &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRwQvn/"&gt;Blackburn responded with another video&lt;/a&gt; to soothe the qualms of hypochondriacs. Others, however, were more concerned with the price tag. “I wish insurance covered this every 10 years as part of preventative medicine,” another commented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Her story even inspired others to book their own scans. One woman, who appeared to be a nurse, shared, “I just went today for a Prenuvo scan and the other guy waiting in his room said he was there because a girl on TikTok found an aneurysm and I said THAT’S WHY I’M HERE. You are sending us all!” Blackburn responded, “Wait this is the coolest thing I’ve ever heard. Following you now so you can update me on your results!” Keep us posted, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user shared her heartbreaking experience: “My brother-in-law just died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He was 39 and extremely healthy. You are so so lucky.” Blackburn expressed her condolences and said, “I feel very fortunate that I can get it taken care of &amp;amp; you sharing this is such a big reminder of that.” If this isn’t a wakeup call to prioritize your health, nothing else is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-a-prenuvo-scan-cost"&gt;How much does a Prenuvo scan cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full-body scan is about $2,500. Just the torso is about half that. And a head and torso scan is $1,800. It can detect aneurysms, cysts, hematomas, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and dementia, metabolic disorders such as fatty liver, degenerative spines, and solid tumors as early as stage 1. Overall, it can &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;detect 500 conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Prenuvo scans are not covered by insurance, per &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt;. As they note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many radiologists have been wary of full-body imaging for decades. Major medical organizations, including the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/250.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/Media-Center/ACR-News-Releases/2023/ACR-Statement-on-Screening-Total-Body-MRI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Radiology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/full-body-ct-scans-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, say there’s limited evidence that these preventive screenings are cost-effective or beneficial for healthy people. There are also no insurance companies that cover the service through companies like Prenuvo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am truthfully doubtful of whole-body screening, for example, to detect a hernia. If the hernia is not creating any issue, I’m not sure detecting it is necessarily helpful. And many times, it’s unclear that anything needs to be done and it creates unnecessary anxiety in some patients,” Zhen Jane Wang, MD, a radiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told Verywell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-you-get-a-prenuvo-scan"&gt;Should you get a Prenuvo scan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo offers full-body MRIs designed to detect early signs of cancer, aneurysms, and other potentially life-threatening conditions. But as Blackburn’s story highlights, the psychological impact of these results can be intense—especially for those prone to anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“I have a lot of friends ask me if I regret it,” Blackburn said. I mean, she’s having a lifesaving surgery soon so that should answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would she recommend it? “I was just a normal anxious girlie before this, and now I’m a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I’m trying to overcome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn did not respond to the Daily Dot for comment, but she did generously share a Prenuvo discount link in her bio for those brave enough to uncover the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" data-video-id="7463201078146993454"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; recently used computed tomography (CT) scans to analyze skulls excavated from the Varnhem burial ground, one of Sweden’s earliest Christian settlements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/a&gt;, reveal widespread signs of infection and disease among individuals who lived between the 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of CT imaging in osteoarchaeology allows scientists to see beneath the surface of ancient bones without damaging them. Unlike traditional X-rays, which provide two-dimensional images that can overlap, CT scans generate detailed three-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology, first introduced in 1971 for medical diagnostics, has become an essential tool in paleopathology. It enables researchers to detect conditions that would otherwise remain hidden, such as infections in the skull or signs of osteoarthritis in the jawbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The Viking skulls turned out to provide extensive information about a number of morbid conditions, without any damage to the remains.

They examined the skeletal remains of 15 individuals and found evidence of chronic infections, degenerative diseases, and extensive dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="painful_lives_and_limited_medical_care"&gt;Painful Lives and Limited Medical Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era population of Varnhem suffered from a range of ailments, including sinus and ear infections that left lasting damage on their skulls. CT scans revealed pathological &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-3d-print-living-human-skin-and-hair-follicles-directly-onto-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone growths&lt;/a&gt; in the cranium and jaw, indicating long-standing infections. Many of these individuals likely experienced severe pain without access to effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why, we don’t know,” said Bertilsson. “While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dental diseases were also common. The analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/worlds-first-drug-to-regrow-teeth-is-now-in-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Viking teeth&lt;/a&gt;, conducted in a previous study, had already revealed widespread dental caries and maxillofacial infections. The latest research confirmed that these issues often progressed to severe conditions affecting the jawbone. Given the lack of antibiotics or modern dental care, even minor infections could have led to long-term suffering or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the benefit of today’s medical knowledge, Viking-era individuals faced chronic pain with few options for relief. “Everyone knows what it’s like to have pain somewhere. You can get quite desperate for help,” Bertilsson noted. “But back then, they didn’t have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief—and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-ai-discovers-previously-unknown-antibiotics-to-kill-lethal-bacterial-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="ct_imaging_preserves_historical_integrity"&gt;CT Imaging Preserves Historical Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists and osteologists have long relied on physical examinations and traditional radiographic techniques to study ancient remains. However, CT imaging offers a non-invasive alternative that preserves skeletal integrity while uncovering new details. It is particularly valuable for studying intact skulls and undamaged bone tissue, where external examinations might miss key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pathological conditions and numbers of affected individuals.

In the case of the Viking skulls, the technique provided a deeper understanding of the health conditions these individuals endured. The ability to analyze bones in layers allowed researchers to pinpoint signs of inflammation and chronic illness that would be difficult to detect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertilsson and her team hope this study will pave the way for more extensive research using &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/ai/3d-body-scanner-breakthrough-uses-ai-to-predict-metabolic-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CT imaging&lt;/a&gt;. “Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_glimpse_into_viking_age_life"&gt;A Glimpse into Viking-Age Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era remains excavated from Varnhem offer a rare glimpse into the past. Their well-preserved condition, thanks to the mineral-rich burial environment, has allowed researchers to study them in detail.

			&lt;p&gt;Just two servings of yogurt a week may protect the bowels from some specific types of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="152333" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new long-term study in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, scientists have suspected yogurt and its living bacteria have benefits for gastrointestinal health, and yet &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35692761/"&gt;not all research&lt;/a&gt; on the topic aligns on what those benefits are and when they are reaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis helps explain some of the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, epidemiologists did not find a significant association between yogurt and the overall incidence of colorectal cancer – the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;third most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when researchers split colorectal cancer cases into subtypes, they did find a significant result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings align with several other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122506"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt;, which suggest yogurt intake may have anti-tumor properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides unique evidence about the potential benefit of yogurt," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Shuji Ogino from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My lab's approach is to try to link long-term diets and other exposures to a possible key difference in tissue, such as the presence or absence of a particular species of bacteria. This kind of detective work can increase the strength of evidence connecting diet to health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results are only observational, they cover the health and self-reported lifestyles of 87,000 females and close to 45,000 males, tracked for three decades or more. Ogino and his colleagues' dataset encompasses a combined total of over 3 million years of individual follow-up data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer who consumed two or more servings of yogurt a week were 20 percent less likely to have a &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;-positive tumor compared to those who consumed less than one serving of yogurt a month. This was especially true for proximal tumors in the upper part of the intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are microbes that are ubiquitous in the human intestine and in the average bowl of yogurt. In about 30 percent of colorectal cancer cases, this bacterium is incorporated into tumor tissue, where it is commonly associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5204/full/v8/i12/819.htm"&gt;particularly aggressive form&lt;/a&gt; of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png" alt="Bifidobacterium Role" class="size-medium wp-image-152345" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-776x415.png 776w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-768x411.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-1536x821.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-2048x1095.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-600x321.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Role of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; in gut health.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, eating more &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/i&gt;could help prevent this leakage in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/18/4/858/683400"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sweetening-your-yogurt-with-honey-could-boost-its-probiotic-benefits"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; the bacterium may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune activation effects, possibly impacting the integrity of the gut microbiome and the intestine's semipermeable barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not yogurt can deliver these benefits will require further research, but observational evidence is mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our finding suggests that yogurt intake might have a cancer-preventive effect for colorectal cancer with disrupted intestinal barrier," the authors of the current analysis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanisms for the effects of long-term yogurt intake on colorectal carcinogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png" alt="Colon Cancer Graph" class="size-medium wp-image-152347" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-708x415.png 708w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-768x450.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-600x352.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer.png 1262w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Locations of colon cancer.

These types of cancers are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that food could work as preventative medicine is worth exploring further. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.019"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 from Stanford University found that fermented foods like yogurt can influence the microbiome and immune system in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Andrew Chan from Massachusetts General Hospital, who was part of the recent analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; their paper "adds to the growing evidence that illustrates the connection between diet, the gut microbiome, and risk of colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It provides an additional avenue for us to investigate the specific role of these factors in the risk of colorectal cancer among young people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y. — People gathered Friday evening in Alden, in prayer and support for a young girl who is fighting for her life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family of 9-year-old Mia Klyczek shared that she was taken to the emergency room on Wednesday, when she &lt;a href="/article/news/health/peak-flu-health-sick-people/71-be5b2981-71a0-448c-980c-4bddcc619183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tested positive for the flu&lt;/a&gt;. This led to bleeding and severe swelling in her brain. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mia's mother shared Friday on social media that an MRL showed no blood flow to her brain and four dead areas. There is a go fund me page called &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Miracles for Mia Klyczek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundraiser, as of Saturday morning, has raised more than $77,000 to help with Mia's medical expenses while she continues to fight her battle.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people organized the fundraiser on GoFundMe, saying: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean and Christina are overwhelmed and humbled by the love and support of their family, friends and community. They continue to need our prayers as their beautiful Mia continues to fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mia went into the ER Wednesday morning, Feb 19th after a slight fever and vomiting. She started seizing and was sedated with a breathing tube to give her body time to heal. She tested positive for Flu B, which they think impacted her heart and later, bleeding in her brain. The swelling in her brain remains severe and the neurologists are continuing to do all they can for this sweet baby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their faith in God is strong and they are continuing to pray for a miracle. Many people have reached out asking how to help so some friends wanted to start this page to raise money for future medical bills while Mia continues to fight her battle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Almighty God, I humbly seek Your miraculous touch in every aspect of my life. Let Your divine presence be a beacon of hope and healing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;When Jaime Bortz was a teenager, she'd gently take hold of her dad's hand while they walked through the mall in Buffalo, New York. She'd guide him along to prevent him from getting lost, as if he were the child, she the parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then her dad, Steve Bortz, went to live in a nursing home. Jaime, a high schooler at the time, was embarrassed to tell her friends where her dad lived. She knew she never wanted to end up in a place like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is making it harder for Jaime to live at home. She's 39 now. As the clock ticks on, the gaps in her brain widen, and she becomes more confused. Memories are rapidly slipping away, much as they did for her dad. She forgets how to dress herself, can't speak in full sentences, and cries a lot, perhaps because she's still aware enough to be frustrated by what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime's half-brother Todd went through this decline a decade ago. A father to three young kids at the time, he started forgetting how to drive his own bus route, often getting lost with passengers on board. In a matter of a few years, memories of who he married, what he liked to eat, and even &lt;span&gt;his own shy nature&lt;/span&gt; were erased. He died of sepsis at 43. A year later, Todd's brother, Aaron, died at 40, with many of the same memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime, Todd, and Aaron all inherited a rare PSEN1 gene mutation from their father that guaranteed they'd develop Alzheimer's at a young age. They are members of an unlucky tribe, the 1% of people with dementia who have early-onset familial Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even with the family history, no one believed that someone her age would have it," Bonnie Bortz, Jaime's mother and Steve's widow, told me when I visited her at home in Buffalo last year. By "no one" she meant friends, family, even some doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has been a default caretaker at every turn. As a young mom, she handled Steve's decline. Years later, she helped Todd's wife, Michelle, go through it. Now 64, she's the anchor of a bustling household, caring for Jaime and her 9-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am feeling desperate," Bonnie said. "I try to stay optimistic and positive, and I just kind of put on a harder exterior — I have to do what I got to do to get everybody through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie is foreshadowing the burden many families will soon experience. An article published in Nature Medicine in January suggests America is set to weather a cascade of dementia cases, a doubling of Alzheimer's patients by 2060. It predicts that by then, the country will gain 1 million new dementia patients each year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Bonnie Bortz (right), Jaime's mom, is her caretaker. Bonnie noticed early signs a few years ago. In her early 30s, Jaime started repeating herself a lot, and kept misplacing her keys and phone.

Because they develop the first signs at early ages, researchers can separate the disease itself from other issues common among older people, like heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Early-onset cases have helped usher in a new class of Alzheimer's drugs, which have started to become available in recent years. While these antibody treatments don't cure the disease, they can slow its progression, buying families a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is much to learn. Researchers don't understand what causes the disease. Ultimately, there probably isn't just one kind of Alzheimer's that can be fixed by one single prescription. Families like the Bortzes show how far researchers still have to go in understanding dementia and developing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like cancer," Fred "Rusty" Gage, who researches dementia and neurodegenerative diseases at the Salk Institute, told Business Insider. "This is not a single disease. There are different forms of it, and they're not just genetic forms versus nongenetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c4f9fdd2-677a-4a34-b18c-86b8beff37be" data-toc-id="c4f9fdd2-677a-4a34-b18c-86b8beff37be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 50/50 shot at dementia in your 30s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie knew something was wrong when Jaime moved back home in her early 30s. She kept forgetting her keys and phone and repeated herself a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The repeating of stories — that was definitely something my husband did," Bonnie said. "And it was subtle, little things." Jaime lost the insurance job she'd had for over a decade. Finally, around the time of Jaime's 36th birthday,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they agreed it was time to get Jaime tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of dementia that runs in the Bortz family is genetically preordained. Someone who inherits a genetic mutation from one of their parents will almost certainly develop dementia, progressively forgetting what they've learned over a lifetime. It generally starts with short-term memories, then expands to erase aspects of who they are and how they function. People with this early-onset genetic form of the disease suffer a much earlier and faster descent than people with "regular," meaning sporadic, Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage says that to categorically separate nongenetic forms of Alzheimer's from the forms that families like the Bortzes have is naive. Each person's genetics shape their case. &lt;span&gt;For example, roughly 60% of people who carry two copies of the APOE4 gene will develop Alzheimer's during their lifetime&lt;/span&gt;. (The actor &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chris-hemsworth-doesnt-have-dementia-isnt-retiring-alzheimers-risk-gene-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Chris Hemsworth&lt;/a&gt;, who carries a copy of the gene from each of his parents, has been open about his "4-4" status.) &lt;span&gt;Other folks, through some kind of genetic luck, can carry the same genes, and may even develop the amyloid plaques or tau tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's and yet never show signs of dementia.&lt;/span&gt; Of Steve's four children, only one did not develop his rare form of early dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's dozens of genes that have been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease," Gage said. Few of them single-handedly control a person's cognitive destiny. If most dementia diagnoses are colored in shades of gray, the Bortzes' cases are harshly black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    Researchers say Bonnie's family is rare and warrants attention as the number of Alzheimer's cases is set to double in the US by 2060, with few — if any — reliable treatments in sight.

                          &lt;p&gt;In 2023, as life at the Bortzes' house was getting more difficult, new Alzheimer's drugs were starting to become available. The blockbuster was Leqembi, a Japanese drug brought to market in the US, designed to clear out the clumps of protein, or amyloid plaques, that form between brain cells in people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New drugs haven't been found to halt or prevent the disease, but data from one of Leqembi's clinical trials suggested it could slow progression down by about 27%. In practical terms, that means people might gain an extra four or five months of independence — of driving, perhaps, or cooking, shopping, dressing themselves, and remembering their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pessimist would look at the data as it stands and say: 'Well, we tried that. It obviously doesn't work very well, so maybe we should start looking at something else,'" Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime was on early Medicare for her disability. Legally she was still allowed to drive, but her mom took her keys away after she failed a driving evaluation funded by the Alzheimer's Association. It was getting harder to remember daily minutia, like the fact that her daughter likes peanut butter toast now, or how to put a paper filter into a coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Still, Bonnie decided not to put Jaime on antibody drugs. She knew that they presented a small risk of brain bleeds and that Jaime, because she's a woman and because of her genetics, would be at a higher risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to cause more problems," Bonnie said. In 2023, Jaime was developing some muscle jerks, prompted by one of the other medications she was on. "I've never seen these medications help her in any way," Bonnie said. "Not with memory, not with anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of focusing on drugs that target amyloid plaques, scientists are starting to try new tactics. More than 100 new Alzheimer's drugs are in later-stage clinical trials. If those trials are successful, the drugs could become available to patients in the next couple of years. They include therapies designed to target neuronal tau tangles, which pulverize and kill brain cells from the inside, and others that go after the inflammation tied to Alzheimer's. Increasingly, doctors are wondering whether the anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/study-identifies-benefits-risks-linked-to-popular-weight-loss-drugs/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; such as Ozempic and Mounjaro may prove effective against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hope that we'd get to a good point where we look at where you are in the disease and we can fine-tune a cocktail," said Lindsay Hohsfield, an Alzheimer's researcher and associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, who cofounded a nonprofit called Youngtimers to support families like the Bortzes.&lt;/p&gt;

When I visited her at home in snowy Buffalo in early 2024, it was harder to tell something was amiss. She could carry on a simple conversation, exchanging pleasantries with a new houseguest — but if you spent more than a few minutes with her, you might notice her start to repeat questions ("Where do you live again?") or variations of them. Sometimes, she'd nod and quickly backtrack, insisting she already knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminiscing about old memories, like her favorite '90s TV shows or her pink prom dress, was much easier than recalling newly acquired information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked how her speech therapy was going, and she turned to her mom blankly. I can't know what was going on in her mind, but it seemed like she was scanning our faces for hints about how to answer and where the conversation should go next. Bonnie sensed the difference in her daughter, in the way a mother can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, sitting with me in the privacy of her SUV, Bonnie pointed out Jaime's repetition. That, she told me, is what it's like everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Bonnie's been there through it all, managing the appointments, fighting to get Medicare payments, and evaluating which drugs and treatments to put her daughter on and which to skip. Driving often gives her some of her few solo moments of the day. She relishes going to work, rare time by herself. Recently she hired Michelle, Todd's wife, as an aide — a familiar face who can come help take care of Jaime for about 10 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie tries to keep thoughts of the future to a minimum. Jaime's asked her, many times, not to put her in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I pray to God it doesn't get to that point, because I would hate to do that to my daughter," she said. "With that being said, I am older. I don't know. I just, I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie doesn't know how Jaime's condition will develop and what kind of support she'll require. Jaime has told Bonnie that her biggest fears are the nursing home and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The difficult thing about Alzheimer's, all brain diseases, if you truly wanted to reverse, you would also not only have to clear out disease, you'd actually have to build the brain back," said Dr. Nathaniel Chin, the medical director at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "This is not an infection where if you identify it, you kill it, you go back to being yourself. I mean, the disease has destroyed parts of your brain."&lt;/p&gt;

That doesn't stop her from being a mom — from trying to do something, anything, to help her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man sometimes comes to her house for 10-minute sessions of cold laser therapy, designed to nourish and energize Jaime's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not working," Bonnie tells me, laughing out loud, probably realizing how ridiculous it sounds. Still, there's a quiet optimism. "Part of me is like, well, maybe we should keep trying, you know? As a mom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently Bonnie joined an online support group for families with early-onset familial Alzheimer's. There she got sucked into another tantalizing promise that a product could somehow help Jaime. She ended up sending about $600 to a man offering specialty herbal supplements before she realized he'd never send her any medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get yourself suckered in because you want to believe that there's something out there," Bonnie said. She's also ordered expensive memory supplements advertised on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of desperation, while Todd was in decline in the early 2010s, Michelle sent a letter to Dr. Phil, begging for his help. Maybe this wasn't really Alzheimer's, she wrote. Maybe, hopefully, it was some other rare, undiagnosed condition that could be cured once it could be properly identified. "It sounds stupid, but I see that he does all these different testings," she said. &lt;span&gt;Deep down, she knew she wouldn't hear back, and knew he wouldn't be able to help. Still, s&lt;/span&gt;he's contacted Dr. Phil a few times since then, including once recently, worrying about what's in store for the next generation of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throughline is a flicker of hope. Isn't there something that can help?&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                                    Jaime's daughter is playful and doting. She also gets frustrated sometimes, watching her mom lose her grasp.

                          &lt;p&gt;Before Jaime's diagnosis, Bonnie was considering moving out of the house where she'd raised her kids and into a smaller home, enjoying a new empty nest. Now her old nest is full of boisterous daily activity again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaime is the last of her generation going through this rapid, fatal decline, but her young daughter is sometimes angry and embarrassed about her mom's condition. She lashes out — a kid grappling with losing pieces of her mother, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, Emma, wonders whether she should get tested before deciding whether she wants to have her own children. New genetic tests, in conjunction with IVF, are allowing some people with familial Alzheimer's to choose embryos to implant that don't carry the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to know, but then I don't want to know — I don't want to be worried about it all the time," Emma said. "It just should be taken out of the gene pool, probably. I don't want to do that to my kids."&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

It also won him a Pulitzer Prize. (Additionally, Yong’s 2022 book about animal perception, “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/books/review-immense-world-animal-senses-ed-yong.html" title=""&gt;An Immense World&lt;/a&gt;,” became a best seller. A young reader’s edition will be published on May 13.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But despite having achieved a level of success and attention that most writers can only dream of, Yong’s immersion in Covid left him feeling as utterly depleted as many of the health care professionals and patients he was covering. So much so that in 2023, he decided to leave his prestigious perch at The Atlantic. Since then, in addition to working on a new book, he has found a measure of salvation, even transcendence, in birding, a pastime that he, like so many others, took up in the wake of those grim days of social distancing and time stuck inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So as we approach the fifth anniversary of the U.S. pandemic lockdowns, I wanted to talk with Yong about his Covid lows, his hopeful response to those struggles and his perspective on the lessons we learned — or maybe more accurate, &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;learn &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;from that strange and troubling time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;I want to start with a subject that a lot of people can relate to: burnout. How did you realize that you had given all that you had to give?&lt;/strong&gt; I remember talking to public-health experts for a story and hearing people say that they were feeling depressed, anxious, they couldn’t sleep, and thinking, Man, that feels very familiar. That was in June of 2020. By the middle of 2023, I realized that I was doing my best work at severe cost to all of the other parts of myself. I actually dislike the word “burnout.” It creates this image that the person in question did their job, the job was really hard and after a while they couldn’t stand how hard it was and they stopped doing it. Which I don’t think is correct. A lot of the health care workers I spoke to said that it wasn’t that they couldn’t handle doing their job. It was that they couldn’t handle not &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;being able&lt;/em&gt; to do their job. They saw all of the institutional and systemic factors that prevented them from providing the care that they wanted to provide. For them, it was more about this idea of moral injury, this massive gulf between what you want the world to be and what you see happening around you. At some point that becomes intolerable. I think that’s much closer to my experience of pandemic journalism too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Do you have any answers for how to contextualize your feelings in a world where people are struggling for subsistence or with the threat of violence? I often think, when I’ll be low, What right do I have to complain? I’m sure you must have had similar thoughts. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a great point because you don’t even have to go to that extreme of folks who are struggling to get by, folks who are in the middle of war zones. Let’s just talk about the people whose stories I’m trying to tell. What right do I have to say, “I have listened to your stories, and I’m trying to write about them, and that, for me, is too hard”? Doesn’t that sound a little bit pathetic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:15:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5mSzAwTk9vYXg1dWRxUXUyMjZJcWR1YTlicWxoazRmRGQxRGtLMUFJLWlydjBFajFvZml1XzBzWV9WeGVJbnVRa1dReU1Wa0tTTGdjd2pHelpIOG9jQVlMcWwyTDZuZWE4ZTRDdVpaODRUUkRq</guid></item><item><title>5 Exercises to Improve Your Balance and Age Well - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBPclBjSTZaZmo0UEotZUFwLUotdEhOZk5ibFdMcWNNLXJvMURGdzE4a0t2dWw4M2JHYlBVT2w3ak1GcURHMk1vV2VoVmtoV0NUTVJBZEk1Y3MwNFgxNlF2UEFVb3ZDdjVMYkRPY0VfWmpWekVpbGRFekZiQ19ZQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Falls are the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;second-leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, worldwide, with people over 60 suffering the highest number. While balance impacts both our longevity and our quality of life, it’s &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an often-neglected skill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/17/975" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; by a team of Brazilian researchers found that 20 percent of the 1,700 older adults they tested couldn’t balance on one leg for 10 seconds or more. And that inability to balance was associated with a twofold risk of death from any cause within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There’s a downward spiral of the people who don’t go out, who don’t walk, who don’t exercise, who don’t do balance training, and they become weaker and weaker,” said Dr. Lewis Lipsitz, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and the director of the Marcus Institute for Aging Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The following workout was originally created as part of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an article offering a 10-second test&lt;/a&gt; to assess your balance. If you have tried the test (with a wall or chair nearby for safety) and didn’t pass, don’t panic: It’s never too late to start working on balance training. And even if you &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pass the 10-second test, it’s important to keep working on your balance, especially if you’re over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Having a good sense of balance doesn’t have to mean handstands and acrobatics.

but less than half of Brits know about a major warning sign that one is about to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chest pains and and being short of breathe are well-known red flags, but it's vital to watch out for lesser-known symptoms like a change in eye colour and swollen legs,  GP Dr Bhavini Shah has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; One particularly bizarre sign is a phenomenon known as digital clubbing, which describes the thickening and widening of the fingernails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It happens because oxygenated blood is not reaching the fingers, triggering the over-production of a substance that accelerates the growth of nail tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also relatively unknown is a grey ring around the outside of the iris, the coloured part of the eye.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 45 per cent of people over the age of 40 have this fatty halo around their iris, rising to about 70 per cent of people over the age of 60, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And its presence has been linked to coronary heart disease - as it may indicate that levels of cholesterol - the fatty substance that blocks blood vessels - are too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Shah, who is a medic with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/home-blood-test"&gt;LloydsPharmacy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; warned Brits to watch out for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;leg swelling, medically known as oedema.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Bhavini Shah, a GP at LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor, warned there are several red flags of heart disease that many people are unaware of. He warned Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; It occurs when fluid builds up in the tissue - a result of a heart that is too&lt;span&gt; weak to pump blood effectively around the body, leading to a build-up in the veins and tissues of the legs and feet.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But less than half (46 per cent) of Brits are aware that this is a symptom of heart disease, a Lloyds Pharmacy survey of 500 Brits revealed.&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2million people in the UK are diagnosed with some form of heart disease, according to Government figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But charities estimate that a further six million have undiagnosed high blood pressure - one of the leading risk factors for stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often caused by fatty deposits in the arteries that can make it harder for blood and oxygen to flow properly through the vessels and to and from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This  increases the risk of a blockage, and therefore stroke or heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs (pictured) are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Less than half (46 per cent) were aware that leg swelling, medically known as oedema is a symptom of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999, Dr Shah stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the most recognised symptom with 80 per cent of people polled identifying it as a major warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortness of breath is another, which 77 per cent of people know about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Shah explained that if the heart isn’t pumping enough blood throughout the body, fluid may build up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Irregular heart rhythms can also be an indication of heart disease, which 70 per cent of people were aware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this might not be directly linked to a serious condition, it’s important to get this checked to understand any underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extreme fatigue that makes day-to-day activities or mild exercise exhausting is another red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just over half (66 per cent) of people surveyed knew to watch out for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart or circulatory diseases, according to the British Heart Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah stressed that there are lifestyle factors that we should all be considering to prevent the disease - and one is cutting down on fatty foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reducing fat intake is an effective way to not only lower your risk of coronary heart disease but also help reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, a high-fibre, low-fat diet is recommended and should include at least five servings of fruit and vegetables, as well as whole grains (oats, rye and brown rice). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS also advises limiting salt intake to no more than 6g per day and avoiding saturated fats, as they can increase cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying active can reduce your risk of heart disease by up to 35 per cent, according to the British Heart Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah said it regulate your blood pressure and lower your cholesterol, whether walking, cycling, swimming or attending a fitness class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quitting smoking can also cut the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because smoking damages the lining of the arteries, including the coronary arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, a chemical called acrolein interferes with the body’s ability to process cholesterol, leading to higher levels in the bloodstream, Dr Shah warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also a risk factor of heart disease and Dr Shah said regularly going over the 14 units a week limit over 10 years can increase your risk of developing heart disease or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 09:11:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPR283UjhWWm5rTnR6emRPZmtibEhkVGFoejZybW0yZjR2MnpCQy1WeTVaREZlQlR3bHlpbWlRUnJadUlSanZ4MGk5UzZIWHQ1RGlNck8tQnJkdDhnMG56dTZLd1duNV9FalBXUFQxOXlFeXBXUzZGZnZGaFIxWW1VVFlQVVZrbTRuemVpNUlfZnVKdzRINi1ncHBxZUV6ZHlsVGNzeTBB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE8zcVhXVlVFWlVwaGFNVnF4X2RwMnpMNmRNdm1sQWtCQ1VlaXBMWW1RTTBiTkNXWExxelg0Qkprb25ILTQyTHZZZzVNOUJVb3ZrM0lzdEhyTHBWLVRZTkdvNEl2bE5aMFJST3dHRThSYU9rLW5yVldKQ2ZBU1pISTJ1b0lfOGpxZFRiNWwtWk9xM3FjVy1MLVR4UmZkVTRCT2twVlhXUGxWNDN1RQ</guid></item><item><title>Arabia's rainfall was five times more extreme 400 years ago - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBRYV9WaG5pZWRycXptTzFVb212WUI3ZmhwOGY0b1NqbU9XajFuVVo3U2FvTEgwUy1HUGVqNVM0eWc3QUFmRndOM25VZEZ1MUhSQkNlSW85RkZaaU5oRmJaTlZsaXBTZDRkQ296andVRGR3d9IBcEFVX3lxTE1rQmdEU0tMNkxXblJldDFma29jbThHTFBETkdjZkc2MHJNa2podWJqUVJ4cVVGbUFnWWpJeTd3SnJQTnlVRHVERHliRmluLVp1V1YzWTYzQ0F5TENhLURBWTJOZldkRmtNVTVvTWcyVFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reconstructing extreme rainfall in Arabia has uncovered that rainfall in the region was five times more extreme just 400 years ago, highlighting the need for preparedness amid growing urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The findings from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science-led study suggest that the last 2,000 years were much wetter, with the region's climate once resembling a vegetated savannah roaming with lions, leopards, and wolves, unlike its present-day hyper-arid desert. The study was &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq3173" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 21 in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As major development projects like NEOM in Saudi Arabia continue to reshape the landscape, these findings underscore the critical need for enhanced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+resilience/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate resilience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/disaster+preparedness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disaster preparedness&lt;/a&gt; to address the growing threat of extreme weather events in the region," said the study's lead author Sam Purkis, a professor and chair of the Department of Marine Geosciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) at over a mile depth deployed from the research vessel &lt;a href="https://oceanx.org/oceanxplorer" target="_blank"&gt;OceanXplorer&lt;/a&gt;, the research team extracted &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/sediment+cores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sediment cores&lt;/a&gt; from a deep-sea brine pool in the Gulf of Aqaba, an extension of the northern Red Sea. The brine's chemistry preserves undisturbed sediment layers, providing a unique and highly accurate record of Late Holocene rainfall trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;They found that the last 2,000 years in Arabia were much wetter, with the region once a vegetated savannah and about 200 years ago, rainfall was double the current amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a key record to fill in the history of Middle Eastern climate. What it tells us is that the climate, both the average and the extremes, can change dramatically in this region, and the assumption of long-term climate stability in future development is not a good one." said Amy Clement, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is considered a climate hotspot, with increasing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/flash+floods/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flash floods&lt;/a&gt; from torrential winter rains, interspersed by harsh droughts, in Arabia causing widespread chaos and humanitarian disasters. The variability of Late Holocene rainfall highlights the need for better flash flood and drought preparedness and understanding future hydroclimate trends as the Middle East rapidly urbanizes. The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/catastrophic+flooding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;catastrophic flooding&lt;/a&gt; across the Arabian Peninsula in the winter of 2024 underscores the urgency of studying the frequency and triggers of such extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Utilizing the technology on OceanXplorer in combination with multidisciplinary experts in ocean and climate science we can further our understanding of the linkages between ocean systems and long-term weather and climate trends, to help at-risk areas be ready for the future." said Mattie Rodrigue, science program director at OceanX.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is typically most prevalent from November to April, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is known to cause some pretty nasty symptoms, but there are steps you can take to stay healthy and things you can do to feel better if you do get sick. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have norovirus, you’ll get sick quickly but won’t stay sick for too long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once exposed to the virus, you’ll come down with symptoms about 12 to 48 hours after becoming infected, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/profiles/faculty-staff/matthew-lokant-md/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Matthew Lokant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/profiles/faculty-staff/matthew-lokant-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Matthew Lokant&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist at the West Virginia University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the hallmark symptoms is a rapid onset. Suddenly, you feel very nauseous,” Sweat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this virus comes on quickly, it runs through folks pretty fast, too. Sweat noted that most people are sick for one to three days, and &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1636/daniel-kuritzkes-infectious_disease-boston" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Daniel R.

Kuritzkes&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said that the norovirus resolves on its own and is not life-threatening for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomiting and diarrhea are the telltale signs of a norovirus infection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to differentiate norovirus from other seasonal illnesses. It’s a gastrointestinal illness that’s marked by vomiting and diarrhea, according to Kuritzkes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that people with norovirus “should not have any blood in their diarrhea, unlike some of the bacterial causes of diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you may experience other ailments that go hand in hand with vomiting and diarrhea, like stomach upset, nausea and cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike colds and the flu, muscle aches and fever are less common in norovirus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It typically doesn’t cause fever, and so it’s not like when you have the flu or COVID, where you’ll have muscle aches and pains and upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose or anything,” Kuritzkes said. “None of those things are common with norovirus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, you can still get a fever or aches with norovirus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So if you experience those symptoms along with gastrointestinal issues, you might have the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The virus spreads through contaminated food, water and surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus can survive on surfaces for multiple weeks, Lokant said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could acquire the virus after coming in contact with everyday items — this could be contaminated food, contaminated water or contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or smartphones, especially when in close contact with infected individuals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lokant also noted that infected persons “have the virus in their vomit and stool.” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air&lt;/a&gt; and end up in a noninfected person’s mouth or on surfaces people frequently touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outbreaks typically occur among people living in close quarters. That classic scenario would be an outbreak on a cruise ship, but other places to consider would be nursing homes or schools,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for norovirus to be spread by food handlers, with Lokant adding, “Foods commonly involved in outbreaks include leafy greens, fresh fruits and shellfish,” while Kuritzkes noted that raw oysters from Washington state and Oregon “have been implicated in some of the current outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Thorough hand washing with soap and water can keep you from getting sick with norovirus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus is very contagious. Some of our standard hygiene methods don’t work against it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alcohol-based hand sanitizers can kill viruses like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, that is not the case for norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The norovirus actually has a protective outer shell, making alcohol-based hand sanitizers less effective than hand washing,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sweat, the key is to wash your hands carefully for 20 seconds and to disinfect any contaminated or potentially contaminated surfaces with a bleach-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended avoiding touching your face while you’re out because “that’s how it typically would be spread. You might touch a surface and then rub your nose or your eyes, and then you can get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Sweat noted that if you’re taking care of someone with norovirus, you should wear disposable gloves and a mask when cleaning up after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you get sick, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main thing is to do your best to stay hydrated,” Kuritzkes said in regard to potentially contracting the norovirus. He suggested drinks like Gatorade or Pedialyte, which will replace the fluids and electrolytes you lose. It’s also important to minimize “solid foods or dairy-containing foods, which are going to be harder to digest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only other main action you can take is to let the virus ride its course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no vaccine and there’s no specific antiviral therapy, so it really is just supportive care, which is essentially fluid replacement,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover in one to three days, but the elderly, immunocompromised folks and young children are at risk of severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older people may have other medical conditions where becoming dehydrated may carry additional risks because of poor circulation or heart disease,” Kuritzkes said. “If you are unable to keep liquids down, and particularly if you’re starting to feel lightheaded or lethargic, that could be a sign of dehydration, and that would be a reason to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional signs of dehydration include dark urine and dry lips, Sweat noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re sick, you should isolate and avoid preparing food for other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s anybody in the household who has symptoms of norovirus, they should not be preparing food for others,” Kuritzkes said. “And then, if somebody has those symptoms, they, of course, should stay home from work until they resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, folks should isolate from other people until they’re feeling well again, Sweat said. But even once you feel better, you can spread the virus for multiple weeks, Lokant warned. This is particularly true for immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get sick with norovirus this season, you should stay away from others for at least two to three days after your symptoms go away, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

                          &lt;p&gt;"Biological age essentially tells you how fast your body is aging," she said. "A lower biological age tells me your training and lifestyle habits are well-rounded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the three areas of fitness she works on with clients to lower their biological ages and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-expert-doctor-bare-minimum-tips-to-live-longer-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;improve their longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fc8770ee-ce6c-433a-916f-7a7c3b2b9c79" data-toc-id="fc8770ee-ce6c-433a-916f-7a7c3b2b9c79"&gt;1) Improve mobility and range of motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a client is mostly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-exercise-prevent-death-sitting-all-day-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;sedentary&lt;/a&gt;, McKenzie starts off "slow and steady," and works on helping them do day-to-day movements as easily as possible, including grabbing things from overhead, getting up from a chair, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also looks at clients' form to ensure they aren't putting extra stress on their joints when exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to get people to a place where it's hard for them to practice bad form because their bodies have become so accustomed to moving the way they're supposed to," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f10ad1fc-d748-431b-b1f2-cad126509c82" data-toc-id="f10ad1fc-d748-431b-b1f2-cad126509c82"&gt;2) Do progressively harder strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2022 review of research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that for healthy adults, 30 to 60 minutes a week of muscle-strengthening activity was associated with a 10-17% lower risk of dying from chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/accepting-type-1-diabetes-insulin-shots-dinner-table-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;McKenzie does whole-body strength training with her clients, focusing on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/what-is-functional-fitness" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;functional movements&lt;/a&gt;, which mimic those we perform in regular life, like carrying groceries or picking things up off the ground. For example, she might include a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/6-exercises-we-added-to-workouts-for-better-gains-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;farmer's carry&lt;/a&gt; or a hang from a pull-up bar to improve a client's grip strength, so they can carry heavy things day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also follows a progressive model, meaning her clients improve in some way each week, whether that's by increasing the weight they lift, adding more sets, or reducing recovery time between exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/67-year-old-bodybuilder-get-fit-any-age-longevity-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Building muscle&lt;/a&gt; is great for longevity. Among other benefits, it can help prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass in older age, which can make it harder to do everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-trainer-fitness-markers-to-watch-for-a-longer-life-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;higher VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; means you have better endurance and has been linked to living longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie has clients do interval training, which involves alternating periods of high-intensity exercise and rests, to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-intensity-interval-training-for-beginners-2018-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;improve their VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; and overall stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

She has since lost at least 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cautioned that anyone considering the medications ‘must always go through a real doctor, though who knows what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Research is everything.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people eager to try the groundbreaking obesity medicine find that their insurance plans will not cover the cost, which can be a high $1,200 per month. In that instance, they often shift to online prescribing platforms involving a brief medical professional consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication typically comes from a compounding pharmacy, where pharmacists hand-mix it using its main ingredients. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-0b494a00-f07f-11ef-8c8b-d5801fca125c" class=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; does not regulate this practice, so disingenuous or inattentive practitioners may use faulty ingredients or incorrect dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;2024 vs 2018: The 53-year-old reality star has shed more than 20 lbs thanks to the drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/811942/rhonj-dolores-catania-gets-real-about-the-menopause-and-marriage/"&gt;Hello!&lt;/a&gt; that the medicine has been ‘a life changer’ for her and her boyfriend Paul Connell, who has lost 60 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘He no longer takes a certain blood pressure medication, and it's been really positive. There are side effects like nausea, but you take a pill for that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials found that people taking Mounjaro could expect to lose around 15 to 20 percent of their body weight over roughly 72 weeks. The drug works best when taken with a healthy diet and exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania shared that she used to be ‘a big carb person.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was Doritos, chips, onion dip. Now, it makes me nauseous. I absolutely don't eat that anymore.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and her boyfriend also work out three to four times a week and while it can be hard to get herself moving, she said, ‘It's starting to feel good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was designed and approved to treat type 2 diabetes but has been &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12111857/Pfizers-diabetes-drug-results-similar-weight-loss-levels-Novos-Ozempic.html"&gt;prescribed off-label for obesity for years&lt;/a&gt;. Mounjaro was approved to do the same but was similarly prescribed to spur weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much loved by celebrities, the drugs hit protracted shortages until just last autumn because people who would not necessarily benefit medically were snapping up supplies as soon as they became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide that mimics hormones in the brain responsible for regulating appetite and feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To many body positivity influencers, the drugs’ meteoric rise in popularity reversed a slow, years-long societal shift toward body acceptance. It also sparked anger toward celebrities for what many saw as jumping on the thinness bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania said: ‘I kind of think I broke the seal on being honest about it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also quick to tell people that, rather than taking the medicine for vanity reasons, she had a medical need for it: ‘I'm going through menopause, I have a thyroid issue, I have inflammation and weight is hard to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I work out, and I don't eat crazy, and I was gaining weight, and it's a lot of different layers.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors often warn people that these medications are highly effective tools for weight management, but they are not a magic bullet for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amy Lee, chief medical officer at Lindora Clinic, a weight management company in Southern California, said: ‘You will acquire the symptoms of hunger and cravings that you had before starting the medication. Your body will return to the “baseline.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study tracked 670 people taking tirzepatide for 36 weeks. People lost an average of 20 percent of their body weight in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Afterward, half of the participants continued taking a high dose of tirzepatide for another year, while the other half received a placebo injection. Both groups also received lifestyle counseling, focusing on reduced calorie intake and regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that continued tirzepatide lost an additional 5.5 percent of their body weight on average, while those who switched to the placebo regained 14 percent of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The placebo group also showed increased cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels compared to when they were on tirzepatide, according to Dr. Louis Aronne, the study's lead author and director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:45:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQNEhBb1lMRm15M0NoVllxSk5TbFBCX2dVSXlXOXo2bkoyQzdNcTE3dzM1V3RUc2U1Q3NCUGwtUTU5X19TdUEyN0tKRHJMeGFNcEZNX2lpd3BaVUFTQWlQOEotUlhIc0N5Z1gyT2hBd3RqWXltVzFNdnFFMnJqNFcwYXpoMGZRSXNzMnpOd2twYXRCdXdUcVhaTXBJcU9ZaDJvUXhJNkRR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE02RE9OOEpjdXBOdC1KUmRjcnNxRUNCY2tWYVZwQjdkYVlkZ21IV3JPYm1SQ1g5a2xoV2hmVFdqWjhTNXRJTjVUY3Fyb0hYRnV3ME5CZ0w3U1RFM1M0YUd0bjhwZS1RU29EWEk4WEhhdkZ3OGtwcUkwNWJMM3BodzdqS0pOU3IxSjYwd09ZR0ZIbmFNemhJeE04S1BDMTVOZzZmVHJEUnFmUW1iMA</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists who risked careers to publish bombshell Covid vaccine study issue message to shot's victims - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOSEMtcEtVMDQ5aTVCZUo0LW9COFVkNWFob2NjVHZnaG1Nc2lSYnVMTHFjTEVSMVJMTDhpdlhtZjQxSjZlTEJIRjJ2ajZfRXdnVmJETVRzUzFsYV9hMnA0cW1YYlh0MG1fek1Zbmo4ZkdRTndLbldUZmlrNmtwUnRJOVB0MnMtOWc1UzJlWW5sdmJtR0Eyd2NCVkJQMWNBbHB3V2ZETXBtMk4zV0pC0gGyAUFVX3lxTE1JcFN1S3A4NHRlX1dtNWlBTjhDQ0txbUJPT0luaWRtM0x6YUpQMkE4YjlzQjExTWlWRkpQQlotNEhhQXBLNUtQMjBLMVZpbF9rZHdoQ0s4Q2dQeEx6dEk3Rm1jbFNZNmNFMUdYQU50eURUdy1yV0FNVW1CZERGQTJ4T0Q4UVhaZ040NWROUV9uNkJzU196dUxHZ1VINHdhN2ZyRVl5c01Cb2dlRlBBQUhmblE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki is one of the lead Yale University experts researching 'post-vaccination syndrome' following Covid vaccines.

Such research will also lead to better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki and her team emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' and that it is unclear exactly how common PVS is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Iwasaki, who is the director of the Center for Infection &amp;amp; Immunity at the Yale School of Medicine, said the team planned to address this question by launching larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before. I've had all the vaccines that I can. My kids are vaccinated.

Such research will also lead to better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki and her team emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' and that it is unclear exactly how common PVS is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Iwasaki, who is the director of the Center for Infection &amp;amp; Immunity at the Yale School of Medicine, said the team planned to address this question by launching larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before.

In total, 74 participants successfully completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study found that participants who took the sulforaphane compound experienced a greater average reduction in fasting blood sugar levels compared to those who received the placebo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two groups was significant. An even more pronounced effect was observed when examining specific clinical subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest improvements were seen in individuals with early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively lower BMI within the study’s context, low insulin resistance, a low prevalence of fatty liver disease, and lower insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/research/anders-rosengren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Gothenburg explained the key findings to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. He told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found that sulforaphane, a compound that is highly contained in cruciferous vegatables such as broccoli, reduces blood glucose in individuals with prediabetes, i.e. a pre-stage of type 2 diabetes. In early stages of diabetes, the glucose production from the liver is increased. Sulforaphane interferes specifically with increased glucose production and reduces it. By doing that, fasting blood glucose is kept at lower levels, which is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that a subgroup of people with mild obesity and well-preserved insulin secretion has even larger effect,” Rosengren added. “Moreover, we found that individuals who have high abundance of a specific gut microbe that converts the inactive precursor to active sulforaphane have increased effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens an avenue for precision treatment of prediabetes to those who benefit most,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third part of the study, researchers also studied gut bacteria. They found a specific type of bacteria that interacts with sulforaphane and seems to make it more effective at lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, people who took sulforaphane had fasting blood sugar levels that were 0.2 millimoles per litre lower than those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a specific group of participants — individuals with mild obesity, low insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion — the difference was of 0.4 millimoles per litre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest drop, 0.7 millimoles per litre, occurred in people who were part of that group and also had a particular gut bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prediabetes is estimated to affect 5-10% of the adult population,” Rosengren explained. “Most people don’t know about their condition but it can be suspected if you have relatives with type 2 diabetes, eat unhealthily and have limited exercise and high BMI [body mass index].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes is a cornerstone but we also need additional complements. Sulforaphane can be provided as a functional food and thereby open up a new form of treatment for prediabetes. It is difficult to eat pure broccoli to reach the levels used in our study (you would need several kilograms per day) but it can be achieved by broccoli sprout extracts. As a consumer you have to be careful as the content of sulforaphane vary widely in marketed products. We used [a tool called] &lt;a href="http://diaopt.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Diaopt&lt;/a&gt; in order to achieve the proper amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rutsunutrition.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a plant-based registered dietitian and owner of Rūtsu Nutrition in Las Vegas, not involved in this research told MNT that “sulforaphane is a powerful plant compound in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli,” and that “it is well known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cancer-fighting properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [current] research showed potential with broccoli sprout extract and its ability to help lower blood sugar levels. However, the most benefit was seen in people who already had low insulin resistance and healthy gut microbes,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, it’s important to understand that prediabetes is often preventable and reversible,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many medical professionals are focused on treatment with medication, versus prevention as a primary approach. People with a healthy gut microbiome also tend to respond better to diabetic medications and see improved blood sugar control, compared to those who do not. This is another great reason to always prioritize a healthy lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An imbalance in healthy gut bacteria can contribute to elevated blood sugar and insulin resistance,” she added. “To maintain a healthy gut, it’s important to reduce eating ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and high saturated fat foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet rich in prebiotic fiber, fermented foods and food in its natural form will help maintain an overall healthier gut microbiome,” Bishoff advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in sports nutrition and wellness nutrition, also not involved in the study, said that “overall, the study shows that the [broccoli sprout extract] did not benefit blood glucose levels as much as originally predicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it did help to reveal that the health of the gut microbiome correlates with effective blood glucose control. Those that had a healthier gut microbiome were more likely to benefit from the [broccoli sprout extract] with a more effective fasting glucose response,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study could have bigger implications later on when we have more research in identifying exactly who will benefit from broccoli sprout extract as a treatment for prediabetes. “I think in my own practice, I would use this information to encourage patients to focus on having a healthy gut microbiome,” Pelitera explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can do this by including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in the diet along with whole grains. This helps to provide both soluble and insoluble fiber and prebiotics, aiding in the improvement of the microbiome. Also, including [fermented] foods, such a yogurt, kombucha, kimchi, pickled foods, and cheeses adds probiotics and probiotics coming from whole foods into the gut microbiome. I would encourage adding these types of foods into the daily diet before supplementing the broccoli sprout extract.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOSW5aNk5TOUFtcnhpbGVCemsxT1NaZEl5S09DR1ZuRm1OQllEOXVwY1lPTU93aTdreUt3ZldUU2FycVd5ZEpwdFo1NGlrbXEyTEx2VzhJclZ3aGxDNjB4TmxYcHFqNXc4allBSndMd0NXcTdyOEQwdXlRcW5od1J6bGhsMDlMeVM5UjBES25iMHNucFBzQWVN</guid></item><item><title>7 best workouts for longevity and anti-aging - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY3I2WUFQUW5nT2lWQktNTHNYNVR5dXFzRHphb3RtSC1mOVVLQS1GanN5aEVCNy1NNHBkOURDc1UwSlRValMxS3J4enRNTzUzeWF4YUVDUkRpQUxiQm84eDdsWkNOaFpCeWN3UF9RTXhBeVRVVXhhWGllMmVIdVpTR2w2UEJPc1ZTS0xoS2o4T04yaUhaaWdoYXVsQWp5Uk1qZ2dyeGRsNk1aQ055MFJDMm5TblBBUU5JR0kwbTRzclZqblVWb2hReElqckxBaHp1bTJvV1NxTdIB3AFBVV95cUxQSEQ1WVp5TTAzMVdpMVpEWXRGUVhtcWY2Q2tsTVNJa2hvWnJQSXR4V1d5SE5aelFHQXVlTmZTR3JsNXotY1BORmJTREdBb1Q0bVBoVTJkbjNOWUt6TVlVNFRaU2NISFJDZ2U4czRhU0pGd1JXbzRGaG5vOWQ0S1dhXzkzRjJfS2NKdThRd25MYkt1NEE0ZVcwcmd1aTNWZ0w3cHl4Q3NzTUxmOEZEVHB2Ykk1bEoyOXlvRUp3ckJyaDhXVVk3YmY0YlMzaGJ6NkMzUE9yTHNGTGNPLUNJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity is a tricky term. It’s not just about genetics or a stroke of good luck; it’s all about balance. Many things come to mind when we speak about longevity. One would be the brain and its cognitive prowess. Then we have the heart, which is the number one killer, followed by cancer and metabolic diseases like diabetes. These metabolic diseases essentially wreak havoc on your body at a systemic level. An overload of blood glucose can reach toxic levels, thereby damaging all cells in its reach. It’s a silent killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Asad Hussain, Founder and CEO of OddsFitnes, “Longevity is all about balance. This is a curious statement as it explains why the longest-living individuals lead the most balanced lives. Their existence isn’t tilted in pursuit of anything extreme. While there are exceptions, statistically, longevity appears to be a direct reflection of balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost disease that most Indians encounter is diabetes, and to help deal with it, strength training is highly recommended. Strength training not only enhances your ability to store glucose within muscle cells because of increased muscle mass (hypertrophy), where it is stored as glycogen but also makes cells more receptive to receiving glucose (by enhancing GLUT4 sensitivity) and disposing of it through anaerobic glycolysis (the mechanism involved in breaking down glucose for energy). This prevents the cells from being exposed to excess glucose, which should not exceed 240 mg/dL for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does this prevent cell damage, but it also reduces the risks of all the other diseases mentioned. It is recommended atleast three 30-40-minute sessions per week of strength training. Just one session is enough to reduce HbA1c by 1.1-1.3 percent over three months without any other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Divya Sakhalkar from OddsFitness elaborates: “Think of glycation as caramelizing your body from the inside out. Cutting down on sugar and moving more can help prevent it. Oxidative stress and glycation accelerate aging unnecessarily, but exercising correctly and eating smarter are the best anti-aging remedies. Imagine your body ‘rusting’ from the inside - exercise keeps it polished and running like new. Too much sugar gums up your cells and makes you age faster, but exercise helps clean up the mess. Strength training is your best defense against glycation. Your body is like a machine—too much sugar clogs the system, but movement keeps it running smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cardiovascular diseases, most people assume that a heart attack is a sudden and acute event that probably happens due to bad luck or factors outside our control. However, cardiovascular disease can literally begin at the young age of 20, taking decades until your coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart) start getting blocked. Exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, not only ensures that you have healthy blood vessels but also helps the heart develop an enhanced cardiac output. Endurance-based exercises increase left ventricular volume, reducing the number of times the heart needs to contract by increasing stroke volume. A healthier heart and healthier blood vessels can be achieved through cardiovascular exercises, and 150 minutes of zone 2 (120 beats per minute) cardio per week can be divided into three 50-minute sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, cancer, which many attribute to bad luck, is a misunderstood disease. Having great metabolic health, a lower inflammatory state, a robust immune system, and a healthy lifestyle in general—all of which can be achieved through exercise—can help prevent and also increase the chances of survival from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NIH (National Cancer Institute), excess body fat, especially visceral fat, increases inflammation in the body and creates hormone dysregulation, both of which create an environment that increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer. When it comes to cancer, exercising not only helps regulate body composition, but it also improves immunity, which helps inhibit tumor growth. Exercise enhances mitochondrial health, which boosts metabolic flexibility, allowing cells to efficiently switch between fuel sources. This optimized metabolism minimizes the excessive accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and reactive byproducts that, if elevated, could create an environment conducive to cancer cell growth. By practicing a well-rounded fitness routine, you can ensure not only the prevention of cancer but also reduce the risk of death due to cancer cachexia, which now accounts for 20-30 percent of cancer-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cachexia is a condition where a person loses weight drastically, especially muscle mass, wreaking havoc on the metabolic and mechanical functions. It is highly recommended to exercise to maintain healthy body composition. A well-rounded fitness routine that includes at least 100 minutes of cardio-based exercises, zone 4 (threshold training) to enhance vasculature and oxygen delivery, three days a week of strength training (to build muscle reserve and improve metabolic health), and two days a week of yoga (for mindfulness and a regulated autonomic nervous system) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, regarding the brain and cognition, all the above-mentioned modalities help with brain vasculature, health, and size. Engaging in racket sports stimulates decision-making and critical thinking, thereby keeping the brain active. Racket sports like badminton, tennis, and squash, combined with a well-rounded strength training and endurance protocol, help create new synaptic connections and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of workouts to do to reverse ageing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, a balanced exercise regimen that includes zone 2 (cycling, brisk walking, jogging) training for at least 130 minutes and strength training (which trains all major muscle groups) three days a week—using exercises like leg press, military press, bench press, squats, push-ups, pull-ups, and rows—helps train all major muscle groups, improving functionality. Additionally, practicing yoga two days a week ensures a long life and a better quality of life. All of these come together to reduce the risk of diseases and, more importantly, improve balance, gait, steadiness, proprioception, strength, and flexibility, making sure you not only live a long life but your best life, where all your long-term narratives require you to be a functional and disease-free individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Secrets to anti-ageing: 7 simple daily habits that give us healthy skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY3I2WUFQUW5nT2lWQktNTHNYNVR5dXFzRHphb3RtSC1mOVVLQS1GanN5aEVCNy1NNHBkOURDc1UwSlRValMxS3J4enRNTzUzeWF4YUVDUkRpQUxiQm84eDdsWkNOaFpCeWN3UF9RTXhBeVRVVXhhWGllMmVIdVpTR2w2UEJPc1ZTS0xoS2o4T04yaUhaaWdoYXVsQWp5Uk1qZ2dyeGRsNk1aQ055MFJDMm5TblBBUU5JR0kwbTRzclZqblVWb2hReElqckxBaHp1bTJvV1NxTdIB3AFBVV95cUxQSEQ1WVp5TTAzMVdpMVpEWXRGUVhtcWY2Q2tsTVNJa2hvWnJQSXR4V1d5SE5aelFHQXVlTmZTR3JsNXotY1BORmJTREdBb1Q0bVBoVTJkbjNOWUt6TVlVNFRaU2NISFJDZ2U4czRhU0pGd1JXbzRGaG5vOWQ0S1dhXzkzRjJfS2NKdThRd25MYkt1NEE0ZVcwcmd1aTNWZ0w3cHl4Q3NzTUxmOEZEVHB2Ykk1bEoyOXlvRUp3ckJyaDhXVVk3YmY0YlMzaGJ6NkMzUE9yTHNGTGNPLUNJ</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists link Covid vaccines to alarming new syndrome causing 'distinct biological changes’ - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in preventing millions of deaths during the pandemic. However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected. Normally, the spike protein stays in the body for only a few days after vaccination, but in some PVS cases, it was still present more than 700 days later. This lingering spike protein has also been linked to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point. We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” Iwasaki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz further added that PVS might be similar to other infections that lead to chronic symptoms, each through different biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation. We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shakira's Health Crisis: Fans Rally Outside Hospital Following Her Statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that a deeper understanding of PVS is required to make better &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/does-the-estimate-of-154-million-lives-saved-by-vaccines-since-1974-stack-up/" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with fewer side effects. “For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce PVS symptoms,” Iwasaki adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only just starting to make headway in understanding PVS. Every medical intervention carries some risk, and it’s important to acknowledge that adverse events can occur with vaccines. Our focus must remain on understanding what these people are experiencing through rigorous science and addressing the needs of those affected with compassion and an open mind,” Krumholz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>USDA issues conditional license for bird flu vaccine amid ongoing crisis - 9News.com KUSA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPZ29IbU1aTjZka051anhVX3c5ajVFVnozQWlMOUw4RTJZeGxFMnNObjRCdWtDOXhPanVvRzNiR2w4dVpVR2J3VVE3Q3ZON0JSN2VFZjg3dFJBbWpnMmtUTTYzZVg2R2w3Q0VLMDI5bDhfMFhKMUx3QU56UG5rdFhRN1JfWVdBdWJMNm9DVVNSMlZFbkdTWlVNRi1YNmxZQjlJcDFmbC01dUNiWVJNN2JUcm0yWVQzLXZnbjhFT2syVWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The virus was first detected in the Japanese pipistrelle bat species in Hong Kong and has now been found to have the ability to bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors—the same receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 for infection. According to the study, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell, the virus can also attach to ACE2 receptors in other mammalian species, increasing the possibility of cross-species transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is HKU5-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of HKU5-CoV-2 is concerning due to its similarities to SARS-CoV-2, as both viruses rely on ACE2 receptors to enter human cells. However, researchers highlight that HKU5-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 receptors far less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2, reducing the risk of widespread human transmission. Laboratory tests confirm that while HKU5-CoV-2 can infect human cells and lung tissues, its capacity to spread quickly among humans is significantly weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-donald-trump-removes-iconic-145-year-old-resolute-desk-days-after-elon-musk-son-visited-oval-office-heres-why/articleshow/118447080.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Trump removes iconic 145-year old resolute desk days after Elon Musk, son visited Oval Office.

Researchers emphasize that the likelihood of HKU5-CoV-2 causing a human epidemic is lower than that of COVID-19. While the study recognizes that bat coronaviruses present a potential spillover risk, not all animal coronaviruses successfully transmit to humans. Unlike SARS and MERS—both caused by coronaviruses with efficient human-to-human transmission—HKU5-CoV-2 does not currently exhibit the same capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-irs-layoffs-will-lay-off-roughly-7000-employees-amid-tax-filing-season-in-trump-downsizing-spree-10-point-explainer/articleshow/118448606.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;IRS will lay off roughly 7,000 employees amid tax filing season in Trump downsizing spree: 10 point-explainer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, comprising experts from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, highlights the need for ongoing surveillance of emerging coronaviruses.

While for others, hunger cues start as soon as the alarm goes off in the morning. Turns out, there’s a lot your body might be trying to tell you if you’re waking up hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hunger is the body’s way of signaling it needs fuel, but it can offer a few clues about other aspects of your health and lifestyle, too. How hungry you feel in the morning can be a matter of dehydration, over- or under-eating the night before, what you ate the night before and how well you slept — all things you can remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s not better or worse to wake up hungry. Hunger is our body’s natural response to when blood sugar is low to stimulate you to eat and keep the blood sugar higher,” Dr. Deena Adimoolam, a specialist in endocrinology and obesity medicine, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, if you find yourself ravenous in the mornings, nauseated or disrupted in the middle of the night because of hunger, there might be something more serious going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to wake up hungry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People might worry when they wake up hungry because they think it means they didn’t eat enough the night before or that they’ll be prone to overeating at breakfast, but “waking hungry is perfectly normal,” says registered dietitian Natalie Rizzo, TODAY.com’s nutrition editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is especially true if the last meal you ate before bed was dinner, she adds. “For example, if you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and then go to bed at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m., you have fasted for 12 hours. Being hungry after a 12-hour fast is normal! And while there’s nothing wrong with eating after dinner, limiting food in the hours before bed leads to better sleep and less indigestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What you eat is as big a factor as when you eat. “The type of food you eat at night definitely plays a role in how you feel the next morning,” says Rizzo. “If you eat a small meal that doesn’t have enough protein or fat, it won’t curb your appetite and can lead to extreme feelings of hunger that night or the next morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those hunger pangs first thing can also be the result of lack of sleep or a sign of dehydration, Dr. Reshmi Srinath, an endocrinologist for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, tells TODAY.com. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re routinely waking up hungry which, again, isn’t necessarily a bad thing, here are some other possible reasons, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You're taking a medication that increases appetite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You had a bowel movement overnight or late at night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You're exercising more than usual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You consumed more alcohol than usual the night before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does waking up hungry mean you have high cortisol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are no studies showing that hormonal causes are contributing to morning hunger,” says Srinath, but it's a widely spread belief. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, naturally spikes in the morning. Like other hormones, cortisol levels rise with the sun and fall throughout the day leading to a slump around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. and then sleepiness at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While cortisol can impact day-to-day functioning if levels are especially high, Srinath says, there’s no correlation between the hormone and a.m. hunger.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does waking up hungry say about your metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a night of sleep, it might feel as if your last meal wasn’t all that long ago, but the hours you spend getting shuteye are enough to work up an appetite and break down the calories from the night before. If you’re waking up hungry, it’s likely not the result of a fast or high-functioning metabolism, the experts say, but a normal occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is waking up hungry a concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If waking up hungry is bothersome or especially distracting in the mornings, the experts suggest hydrating more, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-times-to-eat-rcna58563" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:timing your dinner later;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;timing your dinner later&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating more fiber and protein into your diet so that you’re more satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If morning hunger accompanies headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, brain fog or sweat, Adimoolam suggests a 15-gram serving of “fast-acting sugar” to get your blood sugar levels up and hold you over until breakfast. Some options she suggests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or corn syrup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;4–6 ounces of juice or regular soda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly 3–4 glucose tablets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Approximately 3 pieces of hard or gummy candies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consider reaching out to a doctor, however, if you’re regularly hungry in the morning and your blood sugar falls below 70 mg/dL, says Adimoolam. Chronic low blood sugar can be associated with conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The same goes for hunger that disrupts your sleep. “If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel extreme hunger pangs in your stomach, there’s a good chance you aren’t eating enough,” adds Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This may happen when someone is trying to lose weight, but extreme hunger is never good for anyone. It’s fine to wake up hungry and be excited about eating breakfast. But if you’re waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. and feel like you could eat a huge meal, you may want to look at your overall eating patterns,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/health/waking-up-hungry-rcna192814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9jM2NudkZRLTZaVWtaV2U4cVZCMjFISzRJYVlZN3RsZHlpeGE3bFUxcjQydnlFbkc4eTdBYklydHBmWWppQkwzcWlnSGF0RU5RRFZXWWZ3bndhek1ibGxVaU03X0RKU0ZMU3huc0dZZ1M2aFdfeXZISnhKb3U</guid></item><item><title>These Are The Most Dangerous Foods In Your Refrigerator, According To Foodborne Illness Experts - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMkU1bEl0ZUZpWGxwNTNKTk4ydTRVUDA4czIyMTBDREFIRWdiT2ItcEhRRkQ1akphVlQ2ZFhaVk9xVXUzeGR3LTRUeXR2WE1MRDdUQ2phVEtlS1RLTFpFTEF4MlFZS3pLN2k0bkhZT1czblEtYlJ3WExOTUVOOWxDNnFzWWsxSlNxTE5ha0JPN3lGUTM4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You open up your fridge all the time — out of hunger, boredom or simply a need to find something to cook for dinner.

If you’re looking for the most likely culprits, “Think of those high-protein foods that pathogens love, like meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs,” said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmatt-taylor-cp-fs-cenvh-fcieh-cert-iosh-76247b34%2F%3Ftrk%3Dorganization_guest_main-feed-card-text&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Matt Taylor;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Matt Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of food consulting at the NSF, a nonprofit organization that develops and certifies standards for food safety and sanitation. His view was echoed by consulting food scientist &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bryanquocle.com&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bryan Quoc Le;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Bryan Quoc Le&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed to other high-protein culprits like Mexican soft cheese, smoked fish and unpasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another concern is what’s called “ready to eat” meat or poultry, which includes deli meats sliced at the counter, said University of Connecticut associate professor &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdamicolab.animalscience.cahnr.uconn.edu%2Four-team%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dennis D’Amico,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Dennis D’Amico,&lt;/a&gt; whose expertise includes food microbiology and safety. He also said that pathogens can contaminate fresh produce, including mushrooms, leafy green prepackaged salads and sprouts. “Most fresh produce should be washed and scrubbed with a produce brush at home,” he said. “Just remember to clean and sanitize the scrubbing brush.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another possible danger comes in cooked rice, which Atkinson explained: “Before it’s even cooked, rice can contain spores of a bacteria known as &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt;,” he said&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;This bacteria can still pose a threat after rice has been cooked, and the risk of becoming ill from eating it is much higher if cooked rice isn’t handled the right way.” He warned that rice should never sit out on a countertop at room temperature. “Refrigerate rice as soon as it’s cooled down, and eat it within 24 hours. One misconception might be that rice that’s unsafe to eat will show visible signs of being off, such as being moldy or having an unusual smell. But this might not always be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And, he said, you need to be just as cautious with takeout rice, which might have even more potential to do harm. “Additives and spices in fast-food rice might mask signs that it needs discarding, and there’s no way of knowing how long it was stored before being cooked to order,” he said. “For this reason, you should probably avoid putting it in your refrigerator altogether and toss it out when the meal is over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sight and smell can’t always save you (nor can refrigeration).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person sniffing a carton from an open refrigerator, wrinkling their nose, possibly due to a questionable smell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you think you’ll be able to use your senses to uncover food dangers, that may not necessarily be the case, the experts said. “Don’t believe that if it smells good, it’s safe to eat,” said registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.holyname.org%2Fnutrition%2Fstaff.aspx&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracee Yablon Brenner;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Tracee Yablon Brenner&lt;/a&gt;. “Actually, a good deal of harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, don’t influence the smell, taste or appearance of food. Bacteria that’s spoiled might make some food smell terrible, but bacteria also can flourish unnoticed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As handy as refrigeration is, it’s not foolproof, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wagnerreese.com%2Four-team%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Reese;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Jason Reese&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney who specializes in foodborne illnesses and personal injury. “One of the biggest misconceptions I’ve seen is the belief that cold temperatures and refrigeration completely stop the growth of bacteria,” he said. “While it can slow growth, it doesn’t totally eliminate it, especially for dangerous pathogens, including listeria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, keeping your fridge at the proper temperature is very important. “Higher refrigerator temperatures can facilitate pathogen growth, which increases the risk of illness and more serious complications,” D’Amico said. “The preferred refrigeration temperature is 2° to 4° Celsius (35.6° to 39.2° Fahrenheit), but studies have shown that average consumer refrigerator temperature is closer to 7° C (44.6° F).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy mistakes you should stop making.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person eating salad at a desk with a computer, pens, and smartphone nearby, suggesting a work-from-home lunch break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re in the habit of tossing a half-eaten bowl or can of food directly into the fridge, you may want to rethink that, Le said. “Uncovered foods can easily incubate and spread microorganisms, as the air in the refrigerator is constantly moving and can transport spores around to other foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’ve served a meal and are enjoying just sitting around the table afterward, don’t forget that food needs to be refrigerated quickly, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstopfoodborneillness.org%2Fmedia-page%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mitzi Baum;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mitzi Baum&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the nonprofit Stop Foodborne Illness. “Bacteria are always on the move and can grow in perishable foods like meat, eggs, salads, cut fruit and casseroles within as little as two hours,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if you happen to hear something on the news about a food recall, don’t ignore it. “Take recalls seriously,” she added. “When a product is recalled, consumers should act quickly to remove it from their homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself permission to waste food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person discarding a plate of chili with corn and beans into a trash bin lined with a plastic bag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you aren’t sure how long food has been in the fridge, throw it away,” Taylor said. But to prevent future food waste, he had this handy idea: “Keep a roll of painter’s tape and a permanent marker in your kitchen, so you can easily label items with names and dates when you store them. Always review food labels for expiration and ‘best by’ dates, as well as serving and safe storage directions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you’re serious about avoiding getting sick from the food you eat, it always makes sense to make practical decisions,” Atkinson said. “The old adage ‘if in doubt, throw it out’ is a solid rule of thumb when it comes to food safety, and while it might feel wasteful at times to throw out food that’s suspect, you’ll feel better knowing you’re taking fewer risks.”&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator_l_67ab657de4b0c52db9aac4c3&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMkU1bEl0ZUZpWGxwNTNKTk4ydTRVUDA4czIyMTBDREFIRWdiT2ItcEhRRkQ1akphVlQ2ZFhaVk9xVXUzeGR3LTRUeXR2WE1MRDdUQ2phVEtlS1RLTFpFTEF4MlFZS3pLN2k0bkhZT1czblEtYlJ3WExOTUVOOWxDNnFzWWsxSlNxTE5ha0JPN3lGUTM4</guid></item><item><title>Dementia risk can be reduced with one simple habit experts say is most important you can do - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are nearly 1 million people in the UK with dementia, according to latest estimates, and that is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040. It mainly affects people over 65, though that's not to say it's impossible younger people won't also develop it. In fact, there have been many high profile cases recently of sports stars, especially rugby stars, developing the illness, thought to be because of repeated heavy blows to the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But scientists do not believe that dementia is an inevitability of getting older, and there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing it. The two main things, broadly speaking, are exercise and a healthy diet. But before we get into that, let's look at what causes dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What causes dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is not a single disease and there are different diseases that can cause it. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's is thought to be caused by the abnormal build-up of 2 protein deposits which form "tangles" within brain cells, though scientists still do not fully understand this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. This can happen as a result of a stroke, where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off, or lots of "mini strokes" that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are also other kinds of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia, which is most often diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65 and is caused by an abnormal clumping of proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes at the front and sides of the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What increases chances of dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Studies show an association between all types of dementia and sedentary behavior," Jigar Rathod MD, a neurologist at Memorial Hermann Mischer Neuroscience Associates, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told eatingwell.com&lt;/a&gt;, though he added that "a definitive correlating causal risk has not been determined". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is known that sitting or doing little movement for a prolonged period of time uninterrupted can lead to decreased blood flow in the brain: "Sedentary behavior reduces blood flow to the brain, increases the risk of cardiovascular and related diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), causes brain structure changes, and increases inflammation and insulin resistance," Verna R. Porter MD, a board-certified neurologist and director of Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told the same publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to reduce chances of dementia&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are risk factors to many illnesses, including dementia, that you can't do anything about, mainly age, family history and genetics. However, there are things you can do to lessen your chances of getting them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take breaks from sitting down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a sedentary lifestyle is one of the main factors for increasing your risk of developing dementia, then clearly one of the most important things you can do is try to be less sedentary. To put it another way, sit down less or take breaks from sitting down. This doesn't mean you have to go out and run long distances. Small amounts of walking, and even household chores and walking up and down the stairs, count. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A sedentary lifestyle leads to decreased cerebral blood flow, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. Physical activity, on the other hand, enhances circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients essential for brain health," said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise one part of the body in particular&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr Dean Sherzai, a neurologist and co-director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University in California, recently told the Zoe podcast that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-exercise-slashes-risk-dementia-30908722" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;exercise was "tremendously important for the brain"&lt;/a&gt;. But he then focused on one particularly important part of the body to exercise: the legs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He said: "It seems that for a long period of time we thought that walking and running — which is phenomenal and walking is amazing, running is great if people want to do it — but building muscle specifically makes a huge difference. Because we have the largest groups of muscles in our legs below our belt,activating those muscles can create more of these growth hormones that Dean was talking about, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor. So doing things like squats and lunges, and sometimes we joke and say 'bigger legs, bigger brain'. That could be a title for a really nice book. But really focusing on our glutes and our hamstrings and our quads is incredibly healthy for the brain." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve your diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Diet is also important, though scientists caution that the links between nutrients, dietary patterns, and dementia are still being researched. However, they believe that eating healthier diets reduces your risk. In particular, one diet, called the MIND diet, &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-diet-slashes-risk-dementia-30907191" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;has been said to reduce your risk of dementia by a staggering 53%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines two proven diets – the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet – but focuses even more on foods known to boost brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. This means a plant-focused diet particularly focused on green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries and whole grains, while limiting unhealthy foods such as red meats, butter, sweets and fried or fast foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play brain-stimulating games with other people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Cognitive games, crossword puzzles, word searches and games on the computer/phone are helpful for reducing dementia risk. Board games are also of great benefit as they allow social interaction,” said Dr Rathod. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid smoking and reduce alcohol intake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Smoking damages blood vessels, leading to reduced oxygen flow to the brain, while excessive alcohol accelerates cognitive decline and has neurotoxic properties,” said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3</guid></item><item><title>Ohio has reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.

"We urge parents to protect their kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity typically peaks sometime between December and February, but ODH is reporting that current activity remains "very high." Hospitalizations this flu season have also been "well above" the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn what doctors are telling parents below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Ohio reports its first pediatric flu death of the season. What you should know&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this flu season, Ohio has seen more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations. Hamilton County has had the second-highest number of hospitalizations in the state, with 539. Many of those have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven’t gotten your flu vaccine this year, get your flu vaccine," said Dr. Chris Peltier, a pediatrician at Pediatrics Associates of Mt. Carmel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said one of the reasons we've seen more hospitalizations this flu season is due to the current strain: "(It's) more severe than ... other strains have been in past years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the most common reason for hospitalizations is the development of a second infection in the lungs, causing trouble breathing. But some complications are a bit rarer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Northern Kentucky family took their 5-year-old son Benjamin to Cincinnati Children's after he was unable to walk after testing positive for the flu. There, doctors diagnosed him with viral myositis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It essentially causes inflammation that causes some breakdown of the muscles … and unfortunately the only treatment for that is really sort of aggressive IV fluid, rehydration, and time," Peltier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin's family told us since getting his diagnosis, he is about 90% recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said if anyone in the family gets sick, remember to stay hydrated. If you think you may need to go to the hospital, he recommends calling your primary care physician first. &lt;/p&gt;

Over the following two days, the feeling spread up her legs and worsened when her skin was even lightly touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ibuprofen didn’t help. A trip to the emergency room revealed no obvious culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Five days after symptoms started, the burning kept spreading up her trunk and into her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors were baffled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was the start of a medical mystery that’s the subject of a New England Journal of Medicine case study this month. In an 11-page paper published Feb. 12, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the University of Washington detail how the woman sought help at three hospitals as her symptoms got worse before she was diagnosed with parasitic worms infesting her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s just so unusual,” said Robert Cowie, a research professor at the University of Hawaii and an expert in the parasitic worm that infected the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a week of these symptoms, the woman made a second emergency room visit as the burning feeling and her headache got more painful. Her exam was “reportedly normal,” save for an elevated immune-cell count seen in her blood test. She was discharged with advice to follow up with her primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the next morning, she awoke confused. She started packing for a vacation that was nonexistent and could not be dissuaded by a family member. When the confusion continued for several hours, her partner brought her to Massachusetts General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors there documented that she had returned from a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan and Hawaii 12 days earlier. They noted that she ate street food in Bangkok - although none of it was uncooked - along with raw sushi in Tokyo and salad and sushi throughout her 10 days in Hawaii. She also swam in the ocean several times there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spinal tap revealed she had extremely high levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that fight off parasites and other invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors concluded she’d been infected with the parasitic worm &lt;i&gt;Angiostrongylus &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;cantonensis, &lt;/i&gt;more commonly known as rat lungworm. Although rodents alone host the adult form of the parasite, their feces pass its larvae to snails and slugs, which can transmit the worm to humans. The larvae that infect people never mature enough to reproduce, but can survive long enough to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie, a rat lungworm expert who was not involved in the woman’s care, said doctors “took forever” to figure out what was ailing the patient, based on the case study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie said it’s the most recent example supporting his years-long rant about how “blissfully ignorant” most doctors are about the rat lungworm disease, or eosinophilic meningitis. That ignorance could result in harm to patients who need to take anti-worm medication quickly to avoid potentially life-changing or deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rat lungworms cause symptoms that range from nonexistent to headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When rat lungworm illness was on the rise in Hawaii in 2017, one woman described her experience as akin to the pain of giving birth every day - maybe even worse. “That was like eating ice cream compared to this,” she told KHON at the time. “It was like someone stuck an ice pick in my collarbone, in my chest and in the back of my neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Occasionally, it can cause paralysis or death, as was the case in 2010 when a young Australian rugby player named Sam Ballard ate a slug on a dare from his friends. The parasite infested his brain, putting him into a coma for more than a year and leaving him paralyzed. He died in 2018 at the age of 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People have gotten infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs, a common practice in some cultures, the CDC reported. Some children got sick by swallowing them “on a dare” while others were infected by eating snails or slugs that had been accidentally chopped up in raw produce, salads or vegetable juices. Scientists have also found rat lungworm infections in other animals, such as freshwater shrimp, crabs and frogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Human outbreaks of rat lungworm have involved a few people to hundreds, the CDC reported. In total, more than 2,800 cases have been reported in about 30 countries, although that figure dates back to research published in 2008. Cowie said he’s collaborating with a research partner in China who’s documented at least 7,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have recorded about 220 cases in the United States, the vast majority of those in Hawaii, where the disease was first documented in 1959. In the continental United States, there have been a handful of cases, almost entirely in southeastern states such as Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cowie said he thinks the disease might have spread well beyond what scientists have documented. He said he’s working on a grant proposal to figure out how much the parasite has spread in slugs and snails in the southeast because of climate change and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It could be that the parasite is more widespread than we know,” he said, “simply because we haven’t looked enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/02/22/trump-research-nih-federal-register/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists warn of long-term damage as Trump’s orders slow research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientists warn of long-term damage as Trump’s orders slow research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/02/22/usps-history-ownership-trump-commerce-department/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Postal Service, older than the nation, is about more than mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Postal Service, older than the nation, is about more than mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/20/palestinian-authority-security-forces-jenin/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;With Gaza rule at stake, Palestinian forces struggle to make their case &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 03:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1yakhNTDZNNkFmVHFCTWhZa0JpSDYwWGdvOHNoSTQxSS1OcFZ2ODNibldpUFBvNXQxazBxSlI1UElwRmNFeGJyRmlURVBqVUFVZ3kwN1Z2WFpXYXVub3FoSEU2QWFSZl9McW1uOG1qNm9kUk0</guid></item><item><title>Ohio teen dies after catching the flu; State's first pediatric influenza death - WFMJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPSW01aU1RSjh3amh5SzZmZk5leWdSU0lIYkhBeU5XUkFYdm52T2I4NVVTeWpnZHc2eFJzandiYzgxakVaOThiNEhmYWpyeEozZ3dqaHlxM2JNX3g3WHd4ZXY5MW8yVld2ODd4NVJRVVRPdjVWRmpsclBvTnJScFBGZUxjRzhJWFk5NGxRLVFhaEw5S2lYODU3UkdTbGpfZlpUZGhjLVIwcDZPOFA2RDREMERR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Article-paragraph" data-reactid="336"&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:424"&gt;"Sadly, this tragic death reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat," said ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff.

Surprised? Well, it’s all about nourishing your skin from the inside. Koreans have the skin of their dreams due to their genetics to an extent, a little because of the new-age skincare they use, and lastly through the diet they consume. Put on your favorite Korean drama, and you’ll find everyone sipping a fermented drink or tea. Well, here are 6 types of Korean teas that are known to make you look younger, build immunity, and give you glass skin:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginseng tea&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginseng tea, derived from ginseng root, stands as one of Korea's most valued beverages. A study in the Journal of Ginseng Research confirms its ability to combat fatigue and enhance mental clarity while functioning as an adaptogenic substance that helps the body manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citron tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citron tea, also called Yuja-cha, combines the benefits of vitamin C with a distinctive citrus flavor. This tea proves especially effective against coughs, colds, and sore throats. A new study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences highlights how traditional Korean teas like citron tea can enhance energy levels, strengthen the immune system, and provide essential vitamin C for a glass skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginger tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties, and the inflammation-reversing benefits of it can enhance your skin, giving it a glass skin sheen, as documented in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine. The tea helps reduce body-wide inflammation which makes you look younger and supports immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omija tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omija tea is made from a berry that is high in antioxidants, which protect cells from free radical damage that slows down aging and promotes general health. Omija tea made from five-flavor berries offers sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent notes with a quite addictive taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of green tea on skin health are immensely high. Green tea, known as Nokcha in Korea, contains powerful antioxidants that protect cells from free radical damage, as shown in research published in the Food Science and Human Wellness journal. Regular consumption may help prevent various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Job’s tears tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tea is often enriched with other wholesome ingredients like roasted nuts, seeds, and sometimes even dried fruits, creating a satisfying and flavorful blend that is bound to give you a glass skin. Job's tears tea, or as the Koreans call it, Yulmu-cha, provides fiber, vitamins, and minerals that slow down signs of ageing and bolster immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These immunity-boosting Korean teas combine traditional ingredients with proven health benefits, offering a proactive approach to maintaining wellness through regular consumption. Each tea variety brings unique benefits and flavors, from the earthy notes of ginseng to the zesty profile of citron tea, making them both enjoyable and beneficial for health maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety of Korean teas varies for different individuals. Healthcare consultation is recommended before adding these teas to one's diet, especially for those with existing health conditions or during pregnancy and breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Anti-aging foods to reverse the clock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>The dangers of drinking: Experts explain the 4 ways alcohol can cause cancer - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNYnBZRC1obFNMYmNmbWJoUi16YWdXTjhTY2hxMHFoVWZLRTlJOF9SNzU0R2diblg0OVhBODVlNlNmSktKN19GdzFXeHNQWGZncFlLb2FCeUZlQ3hoem5CbE5aNklYQUU2azdsQTVjUHNpclRud2czbVlaaEVqZ2V4RDlZeFg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNYnBZRC1obFNMYmNmbWJoUi16YWdXTjhTY2hxMHFoVWZLRTlJOF9SNzU0R2diblg0OVhBODVlNlNmSktKN19GdzFXeHNQWGZncFlLb2FCeUZlQ3hoem5CbE5aNklYQUU2azdsQTVjUHNpclRud2czbVlaaEVqZ2V4RDlZeFg</guid></item><item><title>What one man's 'escape' from Alzheimer's might tell us about the disease - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE9oWkYxdXZRTWJKQnZXa0tFeV9HME1sTlpPa2VscElaczFoYm1TemhLQ3o2SHVRakZEVkg3SW4xRm5sVTQ2ekl2OVlJa3JHRG1fdHpsSWZuOWxNbFFEVk1CWmQ0MXViM1RBc2RBNEh2WWZRbjV1VHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Can one man’s successful ‘escape’ from Alzheimer’s teach us more about disease prevention?

that occurs in people 65 and under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has identified a 75-year-old man they call an Alzheimer’s “escapee” because he is yet to show any signs of Alzheimer’s disease, despite inheriting the PSEN2 mutation that has caused EOFAD for the rest of his family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now working to identify the mechanism behind his resilience to Alzheimer’s disease, despite carrying the genetic mutation, in hopes of identifying new therapeutic targets for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was recently published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A case study with fascinating implications about Alzheimer’s risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reportedly first met 75-year-old Seattle, WA resident Doug Whitney back in 2011 when he volunteered to participate in the international &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials/dominantly-inherited-alzheimer-network-dian" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DIAD  (dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by its genetic predictability and almost 100% penetrance, meaning if you inherit the mutation, you are almost certain to develop Alzheimer’s, often at a much younger age than typical sporadic Alzheimer’s cases,” &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/jorge-llibre-guerra?_ga=2.57552297.2042672453.1739811921-701176429.1739811843" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jorge J.

or Alzheimer’s disease, leading researchers to think he had not inherited the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists found out Whitney had inherited the gene, he earned the title of “escapee” or “exceptional resilience mutation carrier” where something in his body was stopping the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation from taking effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Via brain scans, Llibre-Guerra and his team observed that while Whitney had high levels of amyloid protein in his brain, he only had a localized concentration of the protein tau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tau build-up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tau build-up&lt;/a&gt;

Women’s Hospital Long Beach and MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in California, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable that someone with an inherited mutation that is known to cause early onset Alzheimer’s disease shows no sign of illness at age 75,” Dao commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This just shows that even though we have identified key genes of Alzheimer’s disease that can predict with high accuracy the disease risk and age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease, there are potential genetic and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36171657/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proteomic markers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;proteomic markers&lt;/a&gt;

These findings can then be applied to the more common form, late- onset Alzheimer’s disease to help slow progression earlier on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study has identified protective genetic variants to resist the development and progression of DIAD, more studies need to be done to understand the underlying mechanisms,” Dao added. “Specifically, how do these variants restrict pathological tau spread? Understanding this can lead to development of novel therapeutic target treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-one-mans-escape-from-alzheimers-might-tell-us-about-the-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:39:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9oWkYxdXZRTWJKQnZXa0tFeV9HME1sTlpPa2VscElaczFoYm1TemhLQ3o2SHVRakZEVkg3SW4xRm5sVTQ2ekl2OVlJa3JHRG1fdHpsSWZuOWxNbFFEVk1CWmQ0MXViM1RBc2RBNEh2WWZRbjV1VHc</guid></item><item><title>"You Actually Absorb So Much More": For Better Gut Health, Remember This 1 Easy Thing Every Time You Eat - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1iY3JBUjk1ZktpTjlfTFl4bFhKZjcwbWsybDRXN2d4RXI1aFNMdkV6WHNVTklVTGpjVXBrTTdpWHBvaWV1OWRNTjEzZFFTakY4SU11aGNzSkxtMC1WN2JqYUFVYmNRdlpiaW1mY3hWTnh2dDFf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There are countless reasons to desire a healthy gut. Achieving and maintaining a robust microbiome — the trillions of beneficial bacteria and the useful chemicals they’re producing — in the lower section of our gastrointestinal tracts can aid our bodies with everything from battling pathogens to bettering our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I get people to do is, firstly, think about diversifying their plants and trying to get 30 different kinds of plants across the week,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Megan Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. holder and registered dietitian who is known in some circles as the “queen of gut health,” recently told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of &lt;a href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?”&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi said that those plants should come from what she calls “the super six”: whole grains, nuts and seeds, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we want this diverse range of bacteria in our gut, which has shown to have a diverse range of skills and kind of like superpowers, then we need to feed them that diverse range of fertilizers, otherwise they’ll die off — they won’t grow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi, the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/clinic" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Gut Health Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in London, also gave us a tip for better gut health that’s useful no matter what you’re putting in your mouth: Chew your food more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really just comes down to digestion,” she said. “Not only do we start to physically break down food in our mouths, but we have enzymes in our saliva that start to chemically break it down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the more masticating we’re doing, the more nutrients we’re coaxing out of our food, which is good for our guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130715134643.htm#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20with%20fewer,to%20go%2C%22%20Mattes%20said." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; looked at almonds, and they compared people who chewed the almonds 10 times versus 40 times,” Rossi told us.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus can be transmitted via droppings, urine, blood and saliva. The rats also provide a vessel for the virus to move between farms and houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what agency initially identified and tested the rats — or why the rats were tested. A spokeswoman for Riverside County’s public health department said she was unable to provide a response to those questions, and directed them to the USDA. The USDA did not respond to questions Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first rats identified as having the disease in the United States since 2021, when this latest version of the H5N1 virus made its debut in North America. Other mammal species that have since been infected include skunks, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-18/cat-deaths-bird-flu-prompts-pet-food-new-rules"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt;, bottlenose dolphins, harbor seals, foxes, mountain lions and coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 species of North American mammals have been infected, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-13/cdc-study-h5n1-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-more-widespread-than-thought"&gt;tens of thousands of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; — with cases confirmed in at least 973 herds across 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, disclosed Wednesday, comes at a time when the Trump administration is trying to rehire dozens of USDA bird flu scientists it had recently fired, based on cost-cutting recommendations from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the USDA did not respond to inquiries from The Times about the rats or the fired employees, the agency said in a statement &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-in-rats/" target="_blank"&gt;to CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that it was working “to swiftly rectify the situation,” and said it had exempted veterinarians and other emergency response personnel focused on bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency “continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza,” it told the news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:54:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNSDRyc1BtZjFfOGJUQnZaZkNzbkp3WXktZVVUWU44QWYxMnVUblUzUV9fQ3VsTG5Kb0Rrbm1pZy0td3FUT1BVMHk3OVI5S3NLbHc3NW1JU0QwV0kxdEpBYzFwTTNCOTMzOWEtWTNIVW1lWFVacUxaX1FobmRLWUY4dVE3a1hMempFSUw4MTVJMTdzZw</guid></item><item><title>Opinion | RFK Jr. Makes His First Anti-Vaccine Move - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of dead birds recovered from banks of Shark River suspected of having bird flu - News 12 New Jersey</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-1348a9b4-0 lhdfiP"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Up to 100 dead geese, swans, and ducks have now been recovered along the banks of the Shark River in Monmouth County – all from suspected bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“We started seeing the dead birds probably about a month ago, maybe a little bit longer,” said Ken O’Brien, who lives along the Shark River in Shark River Hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“These poor swans are dying on the beach and convulsing and it’s horrible to see,” said Mary, another neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;For people like Mary and Ken, seeing these disturbing sights from their yards has become common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’m concerned about children because they’re always down there and there’s a playground there. If the foxes drag the birds, there it’s not too healthy,” said Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Arlene Sciarappa is the secretary and acting treasurer of the Shark River Cleanup Coalition – a group dedicated to preserving the beauty of the tidal estuary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="block"&gt;“Although it hasn’t officially been confirmed, it’s pointing toward the avian flu, and we want to make sure people should avoid contact with the birds, if at all possible,” she said. “They expect with the weather warming up they expect a lessening of the avian flu."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Dead birds haven’t just been seen in Neptune Township. The suspected bird flu is affecting the entire Shark River Basin from Neptune City to Belmar to Wall Township, where 55 dead birds were recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;More dead birds were seen in Ocean County along the banks of the Manasquan River in Point Pleasant Borough. The DEP says if you see birds acting strangely, give them a call. No human cases of bird flu have been reported in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Crews have since cleaned up all the dead birds along the Shark River from the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials say the first case of what's known as "highly pathogenic" bird flu has been found in a Union County live poultry market. The unnamed store is under quarantine and will be disinfected. The state says no infected poultry was sold to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;If you want to report a suspected bird flu case, call the DEP at &lt;b&gt;877-WARNDEP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 New Jersey</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:46:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu discovered at poultry market in Union County - NorthJersey.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQS3VPUTNmTHRrQWZ1V2Z6V0pXdGdJb3RTQ3BhVEJTOE4wRzB0OGNyMlNvTmpkcVV2YVNVUUlCblh6U0ZVUTAxZHF2U1lmSXVqYk0ySkl3NWlMS0lNVmhwUHBzV0F3Q0V2b1BSTmlQRG9FRkFmNXVPS2kxMzVQdFloZzFtU1Zna0ctbzIybkNYazFkX3pyTkdpbU4yMDZTYzJoMl9PQUVHRC1OT2E3YWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em__fp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/health/2025/02/19/dead-birds-found-in-monmouth-and-ocean-counties/79186976007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg79186976007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="79186976007"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="23"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" aria-label="The state DEP was contacted over bird flu fears after dead waterfowl were found along the Shark River."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;No humans have been reported infected with the virus in NJ.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a window of time in our lives we've all passed through yet still know so little about: early gestation. Researchers have found a pair of genetic deletions associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="152965" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; that likely occur in that formative period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery comes from a team of researchers led by &lt;span&gt;Harvard Medical School &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;clinician-scientist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eduardo Maury, who combed through genetic data from blood samples of nearly 25,000 people with or without schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the two genetic alterations need further validation, the findings strengthen an emerging idea that the seeds of schizophrenia aren't always inherited, yet still may be acquired long before someone meets the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg" alt="embryo as a blastocyst" class="wp-image-152956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schizophrenia might begin with changes that take place when we're little more than a bundle of cells. (Juan Gartner/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it opens the door to early prevention a fraction wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia"&gt;Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; is a serious neurological disorder arising from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, with events such as &lt;a href="https://library.neura.edu.au/category/schizophrenia/risk-factors/non-genetic/index.html"&gt;childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-schizophrenia-have-a-strange-telling-response-to-the-epstein-barr-virus"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.686666"&gt;playing a role&lt;/a&gt;, amplifying someone's risk of experiencing its symptoms of delusional or disordered thinking later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affects in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;1 in 300 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, usually manifesting in early adulthood. Yet there is evidence to suggest the physiology responsible for schizophrenia originates either in early pregnancy or as a result of gestational complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, scientists studying bundles of lab-grown cells resembling tiny brains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-begins-in-brain-in-first-trimester-of-pregnancy"&gt;found evidence&lt;/a&gt; that disorganized brain cells dividing hurriedly and differentiating too early may give rise to schizophrenia. And in 2021, researchers pinpointed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-problems-and-placental-genes-further-reveal-chances-of-schizophrenia"&gt;specific genes in the placenta&lt;/a&gt; that are active during complicated pregnancies and associated with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Maury and colleagues identified two genes, called NRXN1 and ABCB11, that appear to be associated with schizophrenia when copies of the genes go missing in utero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at mutations that are not inherited from the parents," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Chris Walsh, senior author and geneticist at Boston Children's Hospital, at the time the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NRXN1 and ABCB11, the researchers found alterations called &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Copy-Number-Variation"&gt;copy number variations&lt;/a&gt;, a type of genetic error where copies of a gene or long stretches of DNA are duplicated or, in this case, deleted in one person compared to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, copy number variations can be inherited, contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2011154/"&gt;around 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia cases. Those so-called germline mutations would show up in every cell of the body, since they were written into a person's genome before the fertilized egg undergoes its first division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research also suggests &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-is-80-genetic-according-to-this-massive-study-on-twins"&gt;four out of five cases&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia can be traced back to genes inherited from the child's parents, with more recent studies adding to the list of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-schizophrenia-risk-genes-in-first-of-its-kind-study"&gt;known genetic links&lt;/a&gt;. Yet that still leaves roughly 20 percent of cases without an obvious basis in inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two genes identified in this study, Maury and colleagues found partial deletions of NRXN1 in five cases of schizophrenia, and none in the unaffected individuals of their control cohort. This prevalence was much higher than in population-level databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NRXN1 helps brain cells transmit signals and it has been associated with schizophrenia before – when &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3725"&gt;those mutations are inherited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mutations aren't inherited but acquired during early development or later life, they are termed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_mutation"&gt;somatic mutations&lt;/a&gt;. As these arise after embryonic cells have already begun separate journeys forming the different cells that will go on to create a full human, they will be passed onto the descendants of the cell with the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg" alt="diagram of mosaic body" class="wp-image-152950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Genetic changes in some embryonic cells (sCNV) can be passed down to whole areas of tissue as we develop, giving rise to what's known as mosaicism. (Maury et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, 2023)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So somatic mutations are found only in a fraction of body cells; for example brain and blood cells, but not sex cells. This is the kind of NRXN1 mutation Maury and colleagues found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second gene identified, ABCB11, is known to encode a liver protein but its link to schizophrenia is far less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maury and colleagues found deletions within the ABCB11 gene in another five cases of schizophrenia, all of whom didn't respond to antipsychotic medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That one came out of nowhere for us," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Maury of ABCB11. "There have been some studies associating mutations in this gene with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it hasn't been strongly implicated in schizophrenia per se."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; that alterations in these two genes "may contribute a small but significant part of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to figure out just how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;Cell Genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, the Mediterranean Diet has dominated conversations about healthy eating, and for good reason. The Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, has been shown to have heart-protective, anti-inflammatory, and longevity-promoting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But fewer people know about the Atlantic Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less famous but no less nutritious, this diet is deeply rooted in the coastal regions of Portugal and Spain — much like the Mediterranean diet. A new study compared the two diets, finding that the Atlantic Diet is just as good as the Mediterranean one. In fact, it may even be a bit healthier (and cheaper) in some regards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-atlantic-diet"&gt;What is the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard of the Atlantic Diet, you’re not alone. While researchers have studied the Mediterranean Diet extensively, the Atlantic Diet is still emerging in scientific circles. Yet, this diet — rich in seafood, whole grains, and seasonal produce — is good for your heart health, metabolic function, and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two diets are similar in many regards, emphasizing healthy fats, less meat, and fruits or vegetables as well as physical and social activity. The Atlantic Diet is more prevalent in northern Spain and Portugal, whereas the Mediterranean one is more prevalent in the south. But there are also significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic is all about fresh and seasonal foods, as well as hearty dishes. It has a particular focus on seafood, whole grains, legumes, and a bit more dairy products than the Mediterranean Diet. Fish, especially oily varieties like sardines and mackerel, play a central role, providing heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Vegetables such as cabbage, turnips, and onions, along with rye, maize, and potatoes, are staple ingredients, reflecting the region’s cooler climate and agricultural traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many modern diets, the Atlantic Diet maintains traditional cooking methods like boiling, grilling, baking, and stewing. Atlantic foods often include hearty soups. Dairy, including cheese, yogurt, and butter, is consumed moderately, while olive oil remains the primary fat source. Red wine, in small amounts, is also a customary part of meals, mirroring Mediterranean traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. Whereas the Mediterranean Diet (MD) uses more wheat, the Atlantic relies more on rye and corn. Where MD favors more legumes, AD features more potatoes and cabbages. And where MD uses more citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, AD includes more apples, pears, and plums. Soups and stews are more important in AD than MD.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Atlantic Diet is probably just as good (or even better). Image via Unsplash.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do the two diets compare in terms of health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet has been studied extensively and is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and even cognitive decline. But could the Atlantic Diet offer similar benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AD has been far less studied, but there is some research on it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/marea/Downloads/10.1515_opag-2022-0406.pdf"&gt;2010 study in Portugal&lt;/a&gt; examined the relationship between the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) and heart disease. Researchers found that adherence to the Atlantic Diet reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) significantly, suggesting that this diet might be just as heart-friendly as the Mediterranean Diet. In fact, some heart markers were better for people who followed the Atlantic Diet than the Mediterranean Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why? The Atlantic Diet emphasizes fatty fish rich in omega-3s, known to lower bad cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and improve blood vessel function. The high fiber intake from whole grains and legumes also helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study also found that older adults who followed the Atlantic Diet had higher gray matter density in their brains, a marker for better cognitive health and reduced risk of dementia. Furthermore, fermented dairy, fiber-rich vegetables, and whole grains promote gut microbiome diversity, which is essential for digestion, immunity, and overall health. Some researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401068/"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; the Atlantic Diet &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814624"&gt;might have an advantage&lt;/a&gt; over the Mediterranean Diet because it incorporates a wider variety of prebiotic and probiotic foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why haven’t we heard more about the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its clear benefits, the Atlantic Diet remains relatively unknown. A part of this boils down to hype and trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Mediterranean Diet boasts glamorous, colorful dishes like Greek salads and Italian pasta, the Atlantic Diet is simpler and heartier, often consisting of soups, stews, and boiled fish. It’s less Instagram-worthy and less fancy, though very healthy and nutritious. The Mediterranean Diet was championed by multiple countries and recognized by UNESCO, while the Atlantic Diet has not been internationally promoted in the same way. Hopefully, that will start to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, the Atlantic Diet has received far less scientific attention. There’s not been enough spotlight on the Atlantic diet because it’s similar to the Mediterranean one and it’s hard to find more people who adhere to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet will always be a gold standard, but it’s time to put the Atlantic Diet on the map. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As research continues to explore the benefits of the Atlantic Diet, one thing is clear: Portugal’s lesser-known super diet deserves a seat at the global table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other affected counties in Texas include Dawson (6 cases); Ector (1); Lubbock (1); Lynn (1); Terry (20); and Yoakum (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, the majority of the cases continue to be in children: 26 are in infants and young children ages 0 to 4, and 51 are between ages 5 and 17. All but five cases have been in unvaccinated people. Sixteen people (roughly 18 percent) have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, there have been no hospitalizations, and five of the nine cases are in adults. The other four cases were between the ages of 5 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given low vaccination rate in the area and the contagiousness of measles, health officials expect the outbreak to continue to grow. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known; 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated and exposed will fall ill. The disease is marked by high fevers and a telltale rash and can cause severe complications in some, including younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 20 percent of people with measles are typically hospitalized. Five percent develop pneumonia, and up to 3 in 1,000 die of the infection. In rare cases, measles can cause a fatal disease of the central nervous system later in life called Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles also wipes out immune responses to other infections (a phenomenon known as immune amnesia), making people vulnerable to various illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

ACIP holds full-committee public meetings at least three times a year to review evidence on vaccines and vote on new recommendations. The February 26-28 meeting was to be the first under new HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is not required to accept the recommendations of ACIP advisers, the agency has traditionally adopted those recommendations and based adult and child immunization schedules on them, as have groups like the American Academy of Pediatricians. ACIP recommendations also play a role in determining which vaccines are covered by health insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Postponing a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices delays vital discussions and needed decisions on a variety of vaccines by trusted and well-vetted experts," Infectious Diseases Society of America President Tina Tan, MD, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/statement-on-acip-meeting-postponement-and-removal-of-vaccine-information/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "ACIP relies on a well-established, transparent and evidence-based process for evaluating the optimal use of vaccines that plays a critical role in strengthening public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponement is adding to fears that Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines who in the past has accused ACIP members of conflict of interest, could make changes to the group. Voting members of ACIP are appointed by the HHS secretary and serve overlapping terms of up to 4 years. Reporting by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ACIP is among the advisory committees that Kennedy is targeting for changes, and there has been concern that he may appoint people with anti-vaccine views to the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS has not yet said when the ACIP meeting will be rescheduled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes of CDC vaccine promotional campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, changes to the CDC's promotional campaigns for various vaccines could be forthcoming. Earlier this week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported that the agency was stopping its "wild to mild" flu vaccination campaign, which was launched in September 2023. The idea behind the campaign was to promote how well flu vaccines work at preventing serious outcomes, like emergency department visits and hospitalizations, even if they don't always prevent infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/"&gt;Stat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported yesterday that the campaign was one of several to be pulled, and that CDC officials were told that Kennedy wants future vaccine campaigns to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making. Informed consent is an ethical and legal requirement that aims to ensure patients understand the risks and benefits of medical treatments before agreeing to those treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tan said that pulling promotional campaigns for vaccines "leaves Americans with fewer tools to make critical decisions in consultation with their doctors to protect themselves and their families." She called on Congress to hold Kennedy accountable for actions that could undermine vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Weakening our nation's vaccine infrastructure will lead to significantly lower immunization rates and result in many more outbreaks of serious, preventable hospitalizations and deaths," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to confirm the status of the CDC's vaccine promotion campaigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long-COVID advisory committee terminated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other news, an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; issued this week by the Trump administration calls for the termination of the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Long COVID, a group that included long-COVID scientists and experts from several universities. The committee, which was established in November 2023, was still recruiting members and had yet to hold a meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The order also terminated the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Equity Advisory Committee. Also created under the Biden administration, the committee aimed to address structural racism and systemic barriers in CMS programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two were among several federal advisory committees and programs axed under the order, which seeks to reduce "elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers’ findings may support continued studies, leading to a potential, novel treatment to help manage ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Amlodipine tablets | Image Credit: © Ming - stock.adobe.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that begins in childhood and persists throughout life, affecting a person’s ability to navigate daily responsibilities, including academic and professional tasks. It manifests differently among individuals, with symptoms generally falling into 3 categories: hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The intensity and visibility of symptoms can also fluctuate based on environmental factors and situational demands.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Traditional treatment for ADHD includes stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin; Novartis), which have demonstrated significant success in real-world treatment of patients, as well as non-stimulants like viloxazine (Qelbree; Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc). Patients may also utilize behavioral therapy or executive function coaching, as well as integrating healthy lifestyle habits. However, there is always a need for innovation and alternative options that offer patients more agency and options when receiving treatment for ADHD. Additionally, stimulants do have adverse effects such as appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches, and sleep disturbance, as well as a potential for misuse.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers explored the potential of amlodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a foundation for novel ADHD therapies. Of the 5 drugs they tested, only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;To assess its effects, researchers tested amlodipine in zebrafish, a widely used model for studying brain function due to their genetic similarity to humans, sharing about 70% of genes. The results showed that amlodipine reduced both hyperactivity and impulsivity—2 core symptoms of ADHD. Further analysis confirmed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to directly influence brain function.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The team then turned to human genetic data and found a striking link between ADHD and the same calcium channels targeted by amlodipine (α1-C; CACNA1C, β1; CACNB1, α2δ3; CACNA2D3), suggesting a relevant pathway for treatment. Additionally, a UK-wide patient data analysis revealed that individuals taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and reduced risk-taking behavior, further supporting its potential therapeutic benefits. Given its tolerability, cross-species efficacy, and strong genetic evidence, amlodipine presents a promising avenue for developing novel ADHD treatments.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;"Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms,” Matthew Parker, MD, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said in a news release. “Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications."&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;2.

            “I remember being a new nurse in the ER, and even though I had all of the head knowledge of what to do in emergencies, when that patient rolled in from EMS … I found myself having a hard time catching my breath,” said Lorenzini, who is also the host of the nursing education podcast &lt;a href="https://www.rapidresponseandrescue.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid Response RN&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you can’t get your body to work, to do the things that you know how to do, then you can’t help the patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00073b5vcmowo9no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s common for the body’s natural “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;fight-or-flight&lt;/a&gt;” response to kick in, and it may be hard to react the way you would otherwise like to under pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00083b5vevnvqmia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you can train the mind and body so that when the next high-stress situation arises, you are better prepared. Here’s how to keep your cool no matter what happens, according to Lorenzini and other experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t00093b5vvaimrare@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Lorenzini was 9 years old, she went snorkeling with her family in Florida. At the time, she didn’t have the upper body strength to hoist herself up from the water, so she would need help getting back on the boat any time she left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000a3b5vr0m6df7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when she encountered a barracuda in the water, she became so scared that the adrenaline her body produced gave her the strength to swim faster than she ever had and jump in the boat on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000b3b5vp2gxxjwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lorenzini noted that if she hadn’t known how to swim well or hadn’t practiced attempting to get back in the boat on her own, she would not have been as prepared for her quick escape from the predatory fish. “I would have just still floundered in the water, not knowing what to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000c3b5vu97kuthq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her experience shows how being prepared ahead of time can help in high-stress situations, such as completing a nursing program, practicing a speech in front of a mirror or studying for a big test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000d3b5voeknib1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there are also ways to build up what’s called your nervous system resilience, the ability to keep the body’s stress response in a healthy balance, ahead of such stressful situations, said Dr. Inna Khazan, a lecturer on psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a clinical psychologist specializing in health psychology and performance excellence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000e3b5vq7i81a8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One technique she often advises is to exercise the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;, or HRV, which is the way in which a person’s heart rate goes up and down and constantly varies. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;Having a higher HRV&lt;/a&gt; is a sign that your nervous system is healthy and that your heart can adapt better to daily challenges and stressors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000f3b5vdjym6tzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By working on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924557/" target="_blank"&gt;resonance frequency breathing&lt;/a&gt;, a slow diaphragmatic breathing that is usually three to seven breaths per minute and synchronizes with your heart rate, the HRV will increase, which will train the heart to recover from stressors more quickly, Khazan said. People with higher HRVs tend to find it is easier to make decisions, focus and respond in challenging situations, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000g3b5vqzqztv0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By checking in throughout the day concerning smaller stressors, a person can be more in tune with the way their body responds under high stress, said Julie Uhernik, a licensed professional counselor and registered nurse in Parker, Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000h3b5v0nmcxudm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping a physical or mental note of how much stress you feel on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day can help you identify not only your stressors but also the natural symptoms of stress that occur, she added, and doing so can help you better react in those high-stress situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000i3b5vdt3prn1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Basic needs such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep at night are crucial as well for improving your response to high stressors, Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000j3b5vtm438hzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person starts to feel the sensations of stress, thoughts such as “I can’t do this” or panic begin to happen, Lorenzini said. But when you’re mindful that these reactions, such as a change in breath or heartbeat, are normal, then you can use that awareness to your advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000k3b5ve0ml4uay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call it super nurse, or super Sarah, where I can function at my best,” she added. “With time, I kind of retrained myself to say, ‘Oh, these things that I’m feeling in my body, these are not hindering me. These are actually making me a better clinician, a better nurse.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000l3b5vg4v7so0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reminding yourself to take slower breaths is also important, Khazan said. She recommends breathing in normally through the nose for four seconds and breathing out — as if you are gently blowing out a candle — for six seconds to help rebalance the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000m3b5vft6m5cxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The goal is not to relax but rather “a self-regulation practice, so it can help the body get to that optimal level of activation,” Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000n3b5vluka7xgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using your senses, such as taking note of the feeling of your feet on the ground or looking around to assess the situation and the reactions of others, can help you pause and think before reacting, said Uhernik, who is also a disaster mental health responder for the American Red Cross and a consultant in emergency preparedness for mental health professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000o3b5vhpbbhu8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, it is important to remember that stress is inevitable, especially when emergencies happen, Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000p3b5v3lqhbw5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A little bit of stress is good for us. It keeps our nervous systems primed to respond when we need to, and to go back to a state of calm when things are OK and there’s no threat in the environment,” Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The five-year average for this week in the flu season is under 500 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="2"&gt;“We’re still in the midst of flu season, and unfortunately this latest news reminds us that flu can be serious and people should not take the possibility of getting the flu lightly,” said Dan Suffoletto, public information manager for Public Health-Dayton and Montgomery County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="4"&gt;In Montgomery County, there have been a total of 620 flu hospitalizations, accounting for 6.8% of all the flu hospitalizations in the state. This is also a rate of 5.27 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="5"&gt;In Butler County, there have been 193 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 2.1% of all flu hospitalizations in the state, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="7"&gt;In Clark County, there have been 168 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 1.8% of all flu hospitalizations. Greene County has seen 153 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both is-deferred"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high, ODH says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="10"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, according to ODH. Influenza A is the predominant type of the flu being seen in the state, and it &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/flu-a-vs-flu-b" target="_blank"&gt;causes more severe illness &lt;/a&gt;than type B flu, the Cleveland Clinic says. Flu A accounted for 96% of flu cases reported in late 2024, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;The current number of flu-related hospitalizations is well above the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH says. The state’s five-year average omits years from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="12"&gt;There were 9,134 total flu-related hospitalizations by the end of the 2022-2023 flu season, according to ODH, which is in mid-May. The end of the 2023-2024 season had 10,236 hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season. During the last flu season, five pediatric deaths occurred, down from six reported in the 2022-2023 season, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine, Vanderhoff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;“It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill,” Vanderhoff said. “And, especially during flu season, it’s important to maintain good hand hygiene and to stay home if you are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="19"&gt;Flu vaccines are available at most health care providers’ offices, local health departments and retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;Other effective ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;“Staying home from when you’re sick and staying away from others is critical to helping stop the spread of the flu,” Suffoletto said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text text-center" data-index="24"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dayton Daily News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:45:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOR05hWEdsb0xGWjVpNm1zdk9NQy1jbmU2dGpLR29UMVVWei1XSTFGUjI2UlJqV3dlTjhZUTZQSjBHM0FacW9VVkVSdnFyZF81MzhKTDdRMGRTQkhGdU05NC1mMHh4UjJIOW42ekpGWkxqdFE3SDhsTmRFdGpXMmttcnlMYzVBeDYxZGZvdWZWNUdQWnVPSlRxbERhVFE1allJZlA1eG1HOXZvTTI1SmgzajhsUURaQ1kxMm0zWWtVVXVIOFBZc3pBcEtpS0RTaUN5SXRWUXVKNk43TGhNZkFZWWtn</guid></item><item><title>Are you protected?

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON D.C., DC — As &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas/285-e97815dc-93d3-4943-b605-23d14e30d2ce"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread across Texas, there are things you should know about the condition. Below are questions and answers from the Centers for Disease Control as well as a lot of bullet points about vaccination, including how to find your vaccination records if you’re not sure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is only some of the information from the CDC. You can find a lot more on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their page about measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I protected against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, you are protected if you have records showing at least one of the following.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you are either a K through 12 child or an adult who is in a setting that could pose a high risk for transmission. That includes being a post-high school student, someone in healthcare or someone who travels internationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and are either a preschool-age child or an adult in a high-risk setting for transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you are immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an international traveler, the CDC considers you protected if you have records of at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and you’re between 6 and 11 months old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you’re 12 months or older&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you’re immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do I need a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The CDC considers people who received two doses of measles as a child protected for life. If you’re not sure, check with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only received one dose of measles vaccine as a child?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if you were born after 1957, one dose is considered sufficient to be considered protected from measles. Some adults may need a second dose. The CDC says adults who are going to be in high-risk settings for transmission should make sure they’ve had two doses at least 28 days apart.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those high-risk adults, according to the CDC, are:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students at post-high school education institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare personnel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International travelers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who public health authorities determine are at increased risk during an outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs and symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, symptoms usually begin seven to 14 days after infection. They can be dangerous, especially to babies and young children. You should contact your health provider immediately if you think you or a family member has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104°)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says two to three days after symptoms begin, you may notice two white spots (Koplik spots) inside the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms appear, a measles rash may appear. It usually starts as flat red spots that appear on the face and hairline and spread downward to the neck, arms, legs and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. Spots may become joined together as they spread.  The rash could come with a fever spiking up to 104 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children younger than 5 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults older than 20 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is measles deadly? What are the complications?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, around one in five unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. One child in every 1,000 who gets measles will develop encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain. That could leave a child becoming deaf or with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly one to three of every 1,000 children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pregnant women who have not had the MMR vaccine, measles could cause premature birth or a baby with a low birth weight.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is extremely rare, according to the CDC, but can be deadly. It is a condition that results from a measles infection that happened earlier in life. It could show up seven to 10 years after a person has measles, even if the person fully recovered. The risk may be higher for people who had measles before the age of 2.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I get measles twice?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Minnesota Dept. of Health and New York City government, you cannot get measles if you've already had it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What are the vaccines for measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available vaccine is MMR, which contains a combination of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Two vaccines are available for use in the U.S.: MMR II and PRIORIX. The CDC says they’re considered interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the MMRV vaccine, which contains a combination of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – or chickenpox – vaccines. It’s only for use in kids 12 months old through 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a whole lot more about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" id="isPasted"&gt;vaccines on the CDC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I tell if I've been vaccinated against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's no national online database, there are some things you can do to track down your vaccination records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html"&gt;Here's a page from the CDC on how you can do that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This newly identified mechanism is independent of external stimuli and could influence vision by alternating between detail enhancement and object detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments involving over 200 participants confirmed the effect across various conditions, including different breathing rates, lighting, and visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the brainstem may control this process, as the function remains intact in individuals without an olfactory bulb. Since pupil size impacts visual clarity, this discovery may help explain how breathing influences attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil-Breathing Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing may naturally switch vision between detail focus and object detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new diagnostic tools for neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered a fundamental mechanism that affects the size of the pupil, namely our breathing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the pupil is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation – something that could affect our vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107906"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the aperture in a camera, the pupil controls how much light reaches the eye. It is therefore fundamental to our vision and how we perceive our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three mechanisms that can change the size of the pupil have been known for over a century: the amount of light, focus distance and cognitive factors such as emotion or mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now scientists have discovered a fourth: breathing. The pupil is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present and requires no external stimulus,” explains Artin Arshamian, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted five experiments with over 200 participants, examining how breathing affects pupil size under different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the effect persisted whether participants breathed quickly or slowly, through their nose or mouth, if lighting conditions or fixation distance varied, if they were resting or performing visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in pupil size between inhalation and exhalation was large enough to theoretically affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the function is intact in people born without the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that is activated by nasal breathing. This suggests that the mechanism is controlled by the brainstem, a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now investigating whether changes in pupil size during breathing also affect vision. Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimising for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at the same department at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be clinical applications, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Artin Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the European Research Council (ERC).

However, evidence for a coupling between respiration and pupil size remains scarce and inconclusive, hindered by small sample sizes and limited controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of pupil size in visual perception and as a reflection of brain state, understanding its relationship with respiration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five experiments using a pre-registered protocol, we systematically investigated how respiratory phase affects pupil size across different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;50), we examined nasal and oral breathing at rest under dim lighting with nearby fixation points, then replicated these results under identical conditions in Experiment 2 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 3 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;112) extended this to active visual tasks, while Experiment 4 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 57) extended this to controlled breathing at different paces under ambient lighting with distant fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Experiment 5 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 34), individuals with isolated congenital anosmia (born without olfactory bulbs) were used as a lesion-type model during visual–auditory tasks to assess whether the respiratory–pupil link depends on olfactory bulb-driven oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all conditions – free and controlled breathing; different tasks, lighting and fixation distances; and with and without olfactory bulbs – we consistently found that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We term this effect the pupillary respiratory-phase response, the fourth known mechanism influencing pupil size, alongside the pupillary light, near fixation and psychosensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:24:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Dak9uWlRLbGFwSzdCdVZESVRZaHRXNXAydi1Oc243RHQtT2E3ajlOcWJnY0pqOHRVOGRKOWJtV0ViNDlCM05RNGxDWWsxNDAtaS0zVm5QcmFTck00SmlZR1lweFd4ZVNRY0pHcDY4MUc</guid></item><item><title>Neenah family with 4-year-old who needs kidney transplant seek support amid nursing shortage - Post-Crescent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxQVXhzazZneDdMekh2ODJIMTFqVmxyMzVuNUVyalJCMnB2dDZ5THBkMWdYQzVlNUtfa1RpTHVQVkp2eEZ1Z0FZbkllVGxOZTcydE9HanFncnl6Qk1OZldVVThnYkVtUmJlZlp2QTdMNDVvSk9aMVk2S1JXc2o4WHNKSnEzaUlwa3lkdVJaWjhkTlZFeW5mMGlqVHFyaTBnRk81Q3lhbjZ0QWxneW1GcE5jS0dkdWEwVWlWNGNHRUpYU01KaXhtbE95cHJYb3k1NUk5ZV9Lb2RWVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;Mark and Mindi Piasecki, a Neenah family with five children, are seeking community support through a GoFundMe as they face medical challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;The couple's 4-year-old son, Isaac, is on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, while their 1-year-old son, Levon, has a high level of nursing care needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225758007-piasecki-family-2.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt="Mark and Mindi Piasecki have five adopted children: Tess, Adam, Quinn, Isaac and Levon.

As of Friday, it's at just under $3,000 of its $5,500 goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For the Piaseckis, the financial assistance is just one path to support for a larger issue — they need nursing help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Currently, the family has part-time respite support from a family friend and help from a registered nurse for two nights a week, but they qualify for more state-funded help — including 20 hours of private duty nursing daily for Levon's care. The problem is finding a qualified nurse to take on that job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mark works nights, while Mindi cares for the children full-time. If Isaac receives a new kidney, Mark plans to take an unpaid leave from work under the federal &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act&lt;/a&gt;, for at least a month before, during and after the transplant, Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mindi said the family is not sure what they will do if Isaac needs to go on dialysis, since they will be in need of even more overnight nursing care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We're scared to death that we're going to lose everything. If (Mark) has to take a couple months off from work, we'll have no paycheck. We'll have no insurance. We'll have to pay for (healthcare) out of pocket," Mindi Piasecki said.

Mindi said before a blood test earlier this year, she and Mark thought Isaac's health was doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"With kidneys, it's very hard. It's hard to tell if someone is non-verbal and someone is just always happy, you can't tell that there's anything wrong, other than having blood tests constantly," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mindi said it was a bit of a shock when doctors informed the Piaseckis in January that Isaac would be put on the transplant waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While there is no way of knowing a specific time frame, Mindi said she estimates Isaac will need to go on dialysis in six months to a year if he cannot get a kidney in that time. If that happens, the Piaseckis will need more consistent overnight caretakers than just Mindi at their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Currently, Mindi spends nights in Levon's room. The one-year-old relies on a tracheostomy tube and a machine called a pulse oximeter to breathe. Overnight, he is hooked up to "all sorts of bells and whistles and alarms" that notify Mindi if he needs any attention, like to suction his trach or provide oxygen, Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The couple adopted Levon in March 2024. At the time, they had been looking to grow their family, but had not planned on adopting a child with special needs that required significantly more training and learning. Mark and Mindi have a history of caring for children with special needs, between their own children and children they fostered previously, but they had never taken care of a child with a trach — or even seen one up close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But then the adoption agency contacted the Piaseckis to tell them about a baby named Levi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Ironically, my husband and I had discussed what we would name a child if we adopted a fifth child, and we had chosen the name Levon, after the Elton John song 'Levon,' and we were going to call him Levi," Mindi said. "So when the agency told us that that was what his legal name was, it was serendipity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Levon has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22808-goldenhar-syndrome" data-type="link" data-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22808-goldenhar-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Goldenhar Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and in addition to the trach, he uses a feeding tube because he does not have operation of his mouth. Though only 20 pounds, Levon is a fighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He is very feisty, and it's kept him alive," Mindi said. "He's just full of personality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because of his respiratory challenges, Levon needs to be hospitalized whenever he contracts a virus, Mindi said. He was hospitalized earlier this month after a sickness went around the Piasecki family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When Levon and Isaac go to the hospital, they go to &lt;a href="https://childrenswi.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://childrenswi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Children's Wisconsin in Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, due to its ability to meet their medical needs. Mindi said the nurses and front desk workers have come to know their family from all the time spent there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We feel like we're home when we go there, which is kind of sad that a hospital is home to us, but between the hospital and the Ronald McDonald House, they have saved our family," Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225941007-piasecki-family-4.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPN/79225941007-piasecki-family-4.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Isaac and Adam Piasecki pose for a photo.

She said her 8-year-old son, Adam, who is neurotypical, struggles to be away from Isaac when Isaac is at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He's been his best friend since we adopted Isaac," Mindi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, all five children are handling the challenging circumstances well, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong class="gnt_ar_b_al"&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/story/news/2018/07/09/neenah-couple-mindi-mark-piasecki-hopes-adopted-family-continue-grow-kids-special-needs-adoption/750957002/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:42|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;'It's what we do': Neenah family grows as couple adopts children with special needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Shortage of at-home nurses is a widespread issue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/101/107/12/2" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/101/107/12/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Wisconsin law&lt;/a&gt; permits people with some medical conditions that require continuous care to have private duty nursing paid for by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Levon qualifies for 20 hours of state-funded private duty nursing a day, funded through Wisconsin Medicaid. Mindi said the family currently gets about 16 hours of help per week, from one nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Private duty nurses, who are typically contract workers, in general don't have the same health benefits nurses working in a hospital have.

"We don't have something similar for kids, so when they have extreme needs like this, the system is really not set up to meet those needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Piaseckis also qualify for respite care — where a non-nurse caretaker comes to a family's home to give the primary caregivers a break — through the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/clts/index.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/clts/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Children’s Long-Term Support Program&lt;/a&gt;, or CLTS.

So home care agencies in our area are more often funding nursing care and personal care services for adults than they are for children," Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the family waits to see if Isaac will get a new kidney, Mindi continues to search for nursing help for her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They are an exceptional family," Frank said. "They have given so much of themselves to their children, and are so devoted and dedicated to their care, that it is really unfortunate that we cannot figure out a way to give them the support that they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the meantime, Mindi said she encourages people to research &lt;a href="https://www.froedtert.com/transplant/kidney-transplant/living-donor" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.froedtert.com/transplant/kidney-transplant/living-donor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;live kidney donation&lt;/a&gt;, and to get tested to see if they can be a donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The fact is, the more people that are tested, the more lives can be saved.

Older adults are more likely than younger adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and are at the greatest risk of severe complications from the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2830683"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;looked at all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations in adults in Ontario, Canada. Between April 1 and November 30, 2022, Ontario implemented an age-restrictive policy on access to Paxlovid, with only those 70 and older able to get the drug.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the strongest predictor of severe COVID-19 is advanced age, it has been crucial to obtain evidence on whether the results of the Pfizer trials generalized to older and vaccinated populations,” said John Mafi, MD the study’s lead author in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074346"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Univeristy of California Los Angeles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared outcomes among adults just under 70 years who were not prescribed Paxlovid to those who were given the antiviral. The authors identified 1,620,884 Ontarians aged 65 to 74 years during the study period; most (87.5%) received at least 2 COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paxlovid's effect 4 times weaker than in clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors found the prescription rate of Paxlovid more than doubled after the age-based policy was put in place, increasing by 118% at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the increased use of Paxlovid did not result in fewer hospitalizations or deaths for those treated with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences just below compared with just above age 70 years (per 10,000 patients per month) in COVID-19-related hospitalizations (39.5 vs 42.9) or all-cause mortality (109.6 vs 115.7).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the study showed Paxlovid’s effect on COVID-19 hospitalization among vaccinated older adults is four times weaker than the effect originally reported in Pfizer’s 2022 clinical trial, reducing hospitalizations by 1.3 percentage points. The original clinical trial showed an absolute risk reduction of 5.5 percentage points against hospitalizations.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the study found no significant effect on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated older adults, our findings underscore the urgent need for further randomized-clinical trials investigating Paxlovid’s effects in higher-risk populations, such as older subgroups who are frail or immunosuppressed,” Katherine Kahn, MD, another study author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rice University and Vanderbilt University have made significant advancements in the fight against prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have shown that combining a small-molecule therapy called tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with focused ultrasound (FUS) can effectively reduce tumor size in laboratory models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal Advanced Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focused-ultrasound"&gt;Focused ultrasound &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, claiming approximately 10 million lives annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaborative study, spearheaded by Michael King, a professor of bioengineering at Rice, and Charles Caskey, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, is pioneering in its approach. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It highlights how low-intensity mechanical forces can be utilized with TRAIL to provide a new treatment strategy for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;King highlights the pressing need for better treatment options for advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, which ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prostate cancer is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer in over 100 countries,” he notes, highlighting the urgency for innovative therapeutic strategies. He expresses optimism that their findings could soon translate to practical clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional treatments for prostate cancer often come with severe side effects, causing a growing interest in FUS therapies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This non-invasive method enables targeted treatment directly at tumor sites, which can limit damaging effects on surrounding healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shrinking-prostate-tumors"&gt;Shrinking prostate tumors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with TRAIL therapy is its short lifespan in the bloodstream, lasting only about 30 minutes before being metabolized. This necessitates frequent dosing to achieve any substantial effect, which can lead to increased side effects and patient inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRAIL specifically triggers the death of cancer cells while sparing healthy ones,” King explains, noting that previous studies indicated mechanical forces like fluid shear stress (FSS) could enhance TRAIL’s anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, FSS operates primarily within the circulatory system, limiting its effectiveness to circulating tumor cells and not addressing solid tumors directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This limitation highlighted the need for a practical method that combines mechanical forces with TRAIL therapy in a localized manner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to explore whether FUS could serve as a viable partner for TRAIL in treating primary prostate tumors before they metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their investigation, graduate students Abigail Fabiano and Malachy Newman conducted experiments using prostate cancer cell lines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-surgery-needed"&gt;No surgery needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their objective involved varying the &lt;a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-led-study-finds-focused-ultrasound-therapy-improves-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;parameters&lt;/a&gt; of FUS treatment to ensure that healthy cells were not adversely affected by mechanical forces while maximizing the effects on cancer cells. The results were promising. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the combined application of FUS and TRAIL substantially diminished the number of cancer cells and the overall size of tumors compared to administering either treatment alone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This foundational study lays the groundwork for a potential new &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/prostate-cancer-breakthrough-speed-up-research" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for prostate cancer,” King states, underscoring the importance of their research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings could open new avenues in medical treatment, indicating a future where mechanical therapies like focused ultrasound are used alongside small-molecule treatments to tackle various cancers more effectively while minimizing adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers continue to refine their approach, the hope is that &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/3d-genetic-map-prostate-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; insights will benefit patients with prostate cancer and pave the way for innovative cancer therapies that enhance the efficacy and safety of existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue: Sifting through the ever-growing array to find high-quality, healthful options requires some skill (and some patience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:2:paragraph"&gt;That’s why we tapped registered dietitian &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://www.instagram.com/realnutrition/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Amy Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDN for a little navigational help. For starters, here’s a quick refresher on the super nutrient that’s taken center stage: “Protein plays a vital role in overall health, including hormone and immune function, making it a crucial part of any balanced diet,” Shapiro says. “Short-term benefits include improved satiety, &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;blood-sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, mental clarity, and muscle recovery after exercise.

Her general rule of thumb? “Look for products with five to 10 grams of protein per serving [and] ideally more protein than sugar.” (Minimal added sugar is best, she says.) “[Opt for] high-quality protein sources like whey, casein, plant-based proteins, or collagen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:5:paragraph"&gt;Getting hungry yet?

She loves that these are plant-based, contain minimal processed ingredients, and come with a solid serving of fiber alongside their six grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:15:paragraph"&gt;“This is a plant-based complete protein with minimal ingredients and no added color,” Shapiro says. “It’s savory and crunchy—a whole food option.” Enjoy the sea salt, sriracha, or buffalo flavors by the handful, or sprinkle them on a salad for a little extra spice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:20:paragraph"&gt;This soft, brownie-batter-flavored bar is made with &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/collagen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, which Shapiro says can help with joint and skin health, plus 17 grams of protein. “I like that this is sweetened with sugar, but not too much, and the protein outweighs the sugar.” Close your eyes as you take a bite—it’s just like licking the spatula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:23:paragraph"&gt;For an energy boost, Shapiro recommends these honey-cinnamon-PB (the ultimate triple threat?) bars. “Although there is more sugar than protein here, it still has 10 grams of protein, is made with whole food ingredients like nuts and oats, has no artificial colors or sweeteners, and contains four grams of fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:26:paragraph"&gt;While Shapiro’s all for high-quality protein bars and chips (when they’re made with the right ingredients, of course), she seeks out whole-food ingredients over processed ones whenever she can.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2469643?src=exp-la"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging Microbes &amp;amp; Infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers at the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) describe their discovery of a mutated H5N1 avian flu strain resistant to the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) on eight chicken farms in British Columbia in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When investigating a widespread and ongoing H5N1 outbreak at 45 poultry farms, the CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease team sequenced the virus, identifying it as a clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) strain. The virus had a neuraminidase surface protein derived from a low-pathogenic flu virus from a North American lineage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Isolates from 8 farms reveal a mutation in the neuraminidase protein (H275Y) that is exceptionally rare among clade 2.3.4.4b viruses (present in 0.045% of publicly available clade 2.3.4.4b isolates)," the researchers wrote. "NA-H275Y is a well-known marker of resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus likely emerged in Canada in September 2024, the authors said. The US Department of Agriculture later updated its North American A(H5N1) genotyping tool GenoFlu to designate the virus as genotype D1.1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection," the researchers wrote. "As oseltamivir is the most widely used therapeutic and prophylactic against IAV [influenza A virus], the continued circulation of viruses harboring NA-H275Y may necessitate a re-evaluation of influenza treatment strategies in Canada."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's unclear whether the mutated virus is still circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four more H5N1 detections in US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed four more highly pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;avian flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detections, including a commercial turkey farm in Sac County, Iowa, affecting nearly 30,000 birds and three backyard flocks in Maine and Pennsylvania totaling nearly 500 birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last 30 days, 101 commercial and 55 backyard flocks have been infected, at a loss of 21.7 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are fasting, calorie counting and deprivation slowing your metabolism and preventing you from meeting your weight loss goals?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jillbrownfitness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jill Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a certified master health coach and nutrition expert, told The Post that this concept is known in fitness circles as CICO, or “calories in, calories out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean if you’re counting calories and not getting results?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Charlie's – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women typically need to eat between 1,800 and 2,400 calories daily to maintain their weight, while men require around 2,000 to 3,000, according to the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that weight loss happens when the body is in a calorie deficit. But determining how many calories you consume and what equals a deficit is slippery math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199212313272701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found that people miscalculate how many calories they take in by as much as 1,000 calories a day. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Really counting calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people tell me they’re in a calorie deficit, I ask them, ‘How do you know?’ They can’t really answer.  The truth is, if you’re not losing weight, you’re simply not in a calorie deficit,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that part of the disconnect between counting calories and losing weight is that most folks don’t know their exact resting metabolic rate, or RMR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Home smart scales are unreliable, and I see many people using this as their primary measurement,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, “getting a DEXA scan that measures your body composition is your best option,” Brown said. “The next best would be an InBody machine. These machines will give you an estimate of your RMR, or how many calories your body burns a day doing nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jill Brown says stress triggers hunger.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jill Brown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;These machine-generated estimates are based on body weight, muscle mass, bone mass and fat mass, providing a more accurate picture of your caloric expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They can be off by as much as 20% to 30% in normal, young, healthy people. They may be even further off for older people or those who have illnesses or obesity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not to mention, none of these calculators factor in medications or gut health status.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown noted that some drugs can mess with your hunger, alter your gut biome and even slow your metabolism, making it that much harder to create a calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But how do you count calories without tech?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to nail a calorie deficit without integrating technology, Brown recommends a good old-fashioned food diary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have my clients honestly log everything they eat (even little sips and licks) for a good week or two and weigh in daily. If the scale is still the same at the end of the week, they’re burning as many calories as they’re taking in,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Brown, once that baseline is established, it’s easy to find ways to reach a deficit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Eat a little less (think smaller portions, skipping snacks or not having desserts), do a little more physical activity and get good sleep, and you’ll be in a deficit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight, and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Monkey Business – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While a deficit is a healthy goal, Brown says &lt;em&gt;deprivation&lt;/em&gt; is not only ineffective but counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Extreme calorie deficits only work in the short term because they place a huge amount of stress on the body,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“If you try to do this for weeks or months, your hunger hormones will go nuts and compel you to eat back all those calories. If you continue to fight through it, your body will respond by slowing down its metabolic rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you continue to eat an extremely low-calorie diet, your body will simply burn less calories to preserve energy. You will even burn less calories when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown also noted that regular exercise suppresses hunger, but over-exertion amplifies it. Thus, she recommends people find a sweet spot between challenge and exhaustion that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She counts rest and relaxation as additional requisites for weight loss: “Getting quality sleep while managing stress prevents those sneaky hunger hormones from derailing you when you don’t realize it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Indefinite changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stat asked the HHS specifically about the Wild to Mild campaign as well as promotional campaigns for other vaccines, but an HHS spokesperson puzzlingly responded with a statement saying: "No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage," which wasn't what the outlet had asked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement went on to say: "Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive." NPR received the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile on Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the HHS told the CDC to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"&gt;indefinitely postpone a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee&lt;/a&gt; (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP), which Kennedy has criticized. ACIP, comprised of independent experts, meets regularly to review and discuss vaccine safety and efficacy data and vote on recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP was previously &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/Xvof3"&gt;scheduled to meet February 26 to 28&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf"&gt;discuss a large number of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including those against meningitis, influenza, RSV, chikungunya, HPV, mpox, pneumococcal infections, Lyme disease, COVID-19, and CMV. An HHS spokesperson told the Post that the meeting was "postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting," but there is no rescheduled date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading medical experts and organizations, such as the American Medical Association, quickly sent &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting"&gt;a joint letter urging Kennedy to preserve the meeting&lt;/a&gt;. "Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance," the letter states. 'Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats. ... Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, also on Thursday, Politico reported that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Kennedy is preparing to remove ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;. And, the AP noted earlier that during a speech to HHS employees on Tuesday, Kennedy vowed to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;investigate the CDC's childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, despite assuring senators prior to his confirmation that he would not make changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Sore, itchy, and burning eyes may indicate trouble with ocular wellness, which in turn can also have an impact on moods and interfere with productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In modern times, our eye health can be affected by a range of factors from pollution, digital stress, to ultraviolet radiation. Not only, our precious pair of eyes require some screen-free time, but also proper nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet rich in antioxidants like vitamin A, B1, C, and other eye-friendly nutrients like zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, can help reduce inflammation and help protect the eyes from many common conditions like dry eyes, red eyes, poor vision, cataracts among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health, antioxidants that remove potentially damaging oxidizing agents from the body can play a critical role in our eye health. Oxidation can have a role in cell aging and death. Antioxidants can slow down this process. Vitamins A, C and E are among the key nutrients for boosting eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eye health, Vitamin A is the star nutrient that helps maintain healthy vision and prevent debilitating illnesses linked to its deficiency. Vitamin A is needed to produce pigments that help you see full spectrum of the light. The deficiency of this important nutrient can lead to night blindness. Vitamin A helps maintain a healthy cornea and supports the production of rhodopsin, a protein necessary for night vision. A deficiency in vitamin A can lead to dryness, night blindness, and even severe vision impairments over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What’s the Most Important Reason to Include Eye-Friendly Nutrients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sources: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy green vegetables, oranges, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, eggs, and cantaloupes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinc is a loyal companion of Vitamin A as it helps transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina, where it helps in melanin production, a pigment that protects the eyes. According to WebMD, zinc supplements, when used in combination with antioxidant vitamins, can slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a change in eyesight that comes with age. Since zinc can reduce copper absorption, it’s often paired with copper supplements for balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oysters, lobsters, yoghurt, zinc-fortified breakfast cereal, baked beans, and cashews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C also lends a strong support to our eye health with its ability to ease oxidative stress in the eye cells and supporting healthy blood vessels. According to a study in journal Nutrients, Vitamin C can play a key role in preventing cataract formation. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant which can prevent oxidative damage and boost eye health. With age, vitamin C levels in the lens decline, and lower levels are linked to more severe cataracts. While dietary vitamin C can increase its concentration in the lens, research on its effectiveness in preventing cataracts has been inconsistent. The crucial nutrient also helps promote tear production, and avoid dry eye syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citrus fruits, berries, kiwi, bell peppers, tomatoes, leafy greens, and broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids can prevent your precious pair of eyes from damaging eye conditions like glaucoma which can even cause blindness. The nutrient is also known to treat dry eye syndrome, a condition when your eyes don't produce sufficient tears. Found in high concentrations in retinal cells, omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA, are essential for visual development and retinal function. These fatty acids may help reduce inflammation, and support corneal and retinal healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sources: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and algae-based supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B1 is an essential nutrient that helps reduce eye inflammation and may alleviate symptoms of dry eye syndrome. It’s often referred to as an “anti-stress” vitamin due to its role in maintaining nerve function, which is crucial for eye health. Vitamin B1 supplementation can also reduce cataract development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sources: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, pork, and fortified cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By including all these amazing nutrients, you can help improve your eye wellness and ensure they remain healthy for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from a balanced diet with all the crucial nutrients, it's important to prevent your eyes from digital stress. Taking breaks, looking away from screen, closing your eyes for a few seconds can help with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Easy eye exercises for reducing digital strains&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the 20-20-20 rule—every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to relax your eye muscles. Blinking exercises can also prevent dryness; try blinking slowly and deliberately for 10 seconds to refresh your eyes. Palming—gently cupping your hands over closed eyes without pressure—soothes fatigue. To improve focus, practice eye rolling by moving your eyes in circular motions. Lastly, near-far focusing can strengthen eye muscles—hold a finger close to your face, focus on it, then shift your gaze to a distant object. These quick exercises can ease digital eye strain and keep your vision sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from this limit your skin exposure, and practice good eye hygiene, like washing your hands before putting in or taking out contact lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;10 best foods to control diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Do you know which vaccines you got as a child?

Walnut supplementation can improve cognition and reduce the risk of or progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study brain activity recordings were taken to demonstrate changes in neutral activity suggesting walnuts may help the brain work more efficiently during challenging mental tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, blood samples showed positive shifts in glucose and fatty acid levels, crucial factors in supporting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from brain health, nutrient-dense walnuts can nourish the entire body. They are also considered heart-healthy nuts and highly recommended by American Heart Association as they help lower bad cholesterol and improve other cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts are also an excellent snack for those with type 2 diabetes. The polyphenols in walnuts can help ease oxidative stress and inflammation, the root cause of chronic conditions like heart disease, Alzheimer’s and even some cancers.

A week later, deadly outbreaks with a slower disease course occurred at two high-biosecurity chicken farms, where dead birds were found mainly near the barns' air-intake vents; the entire population was culled. All farms had their own wells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts hypothesize that the slower disease course in the chicken barns may be due to lower H5N1 transmissibility in chickens, waning concentrations of the virus over distance from the duck farm, or housing conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers, from the State Veterinary Institute Prague, used genetic, epizootiologic, meteorologic, and geographic data to reconstruct events suggesting that wind was the mechanism of H5N1 transmission between poultry on at least two of the farms. Three H5N1 strains collected from birds at all three farms were genetically identical, no large waterways were near the chicken farms, and the duck farm didn't share staff or contractors with the chicken farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, meteorologic data revealed a breeze in the direction of the chicken farms, cloudy conditions that could have kept the sun's ultraviolet light from killing the virus, and virus-supporting cool air. The team didn't conduct air sampling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation," the study authors wrote. "They also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Airborne not only or major mode of spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead study author Alexander Nagy, PhD, told CIDRAP News that he and his team became convinced about the role of windborne transmission in these outbreaks when they confirmed the identical identity of the H5N1 strain in the donor and recipient farms, the nearly ideal weather conditions during the transmission event, and the slow disease progression in the chicken barns characterized by feed and water consumption before clinical signs appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Additionally, the affected birds [dead chickens] were located in sections closest to the air inlets," he said. "Finally, we excluded all other plausible explanations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News, said airborne transmission can be very important, "meaning that that's the most logical explanation for when you have many barns with outbreaks in one geographic area where human biosecurity cannot be implicated as a reason for transmission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, he said, the poultry industry has been reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission because of the implications it may have for its practices: "The industry's reluctance to accept this possibility is not that dissimilar to what we saw with the lack of some in the medical and public health communities to recognize that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was also airborne."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the researchers did a very good job of laying out their hypothesis and supporting data, their conclusion should be interpreted with caution, said David Swayne, DVM, PhD, a poultry veterinarian who retired as an avian flu researcher with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Research Service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think we, as veterinarians who deal with avian influenza and other infectious diseases, would acknowledge that there is some airborne—and I'll use the word dissemination—and that may lead to transmission," he said. "But we have to be cautious to make sure people understand that it doesn't mean that it's the only way, nor that it's the major way. And each individual facility is going to be different."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montserrat Torremorell, DVM, PhD, chair of the Department of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, called the researchers' argument for airborne transmission "compelling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Meteorological conditions, timing of infection, housing conditions of the animals, susceptibility of the animal populations that became infected and the lack of other epidemiological links between the premises are supportive of airborne transmission in this case," she said in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an avian flu outbreak in Minnesota, Torremorell collected air samples inside and outside facilities housing three infected turkey and three egg-laying chicken flocks. Air samples from five of six flocks tested positive for large quantities of H5N1 virus, all of them in the active infection stage. The negative sample was from a flock in the advanced stage of depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The larger number of positive samples were inside the facility and at the exhaust fan (~5 m [meters; 16 feet] away from the facility), and the number of positives decreased with distance, but even with that we identified some suspects (traces of RNA material) at about 150 m and 1 km [kilometer; roughly a half mile)," she said. "Viable virus (through virus isolation) was found inside the facilities, at the outside of the exhaust fan and at about 100 m."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entry mechanism difficult to determine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Stallknecht, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine and a wildlife expert, said the study provides additional circumstantial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692305/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to several &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031114"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggesting windborne viral spread. But he added that the mechanism of disease transmission into a poultry house is hardly ever identified, because there is no way to control for variables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically says that it could have happened, and I would not dispute that," he said. "But to actually come down with concrete proof like you would in an experimental controlled experiment, there's too much going on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Influenza can be transmitted by a million different ways, probably many of them we don't even know about," he added. For example, whether the virus entered the poultry house via a raccoon, bird, person, or a person's shoes, "those kind of details never really get resolved."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stallknecht said he and his team tried to research water-based avian flu transmission associated with ducks. "And we got to the point where we just had to quit because the numbers and the probabilities were so extreme," he said. "You can't do an experiment to pick up a one-in-a-trillion event."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Swayne said that moving equipment and people in and out of poultry barns has to be done at a very high level of biosecurity to prevent viral transmission: "Yes, you could have movement of the virus by the wind, but it may be that it's tracked in to the barns by the contamination around the outside, either from wild birds depositing fecal material there as they eat, spilled feed off of grain silos, etc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added that just because a virus is transported via the wind doesn't necessarily mean it will enter a barn that way. "The virus can move on particles or water droplets by the wind for a distance, and then it could land and contaminate the environment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authors were initially skeptical, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nagy acknowledged that airborne spread isn't typically considered a primary route of infection in poultry, and windborne spread requires "a constellation of many specific conditions" that behooves further research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"However, when all conditions align, windborne transmission becomes a feasible mode of spread and could play a more significant role than previously thought, especially in densely populated poultry areas," he said. "The windborne route is important to consider in cases when the infection emerges in new locations without obvious links to other farms or when illness and mortality are first observed near the air inlets."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poultry operations typically consist of confined, mechanically ventilated buildings with high population densities, a situation unlikely to change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

James Messerschmidt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 66 confirmed cases of the avian flu in cats across the country, where most of the instances were linked to the animals eating infected foods and prompting officials to ring alarm bells for the “susceptible” feline population as the virus continues to rip through avian flocks across the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the city warned against allowing cats to roam outdoors “where they may hunt wild birds or other animals” and from ingesting raw food that could have been tainted by infected birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian flu cases in the Big Apple have been rapidly spreading in 2025, with nearly 2,000 birds across five flocks found to be affected compared to 4,870 birds across all of the previous two years, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen ducks and wild birds at the Queens and Bronx zoos have been killed by the suspected virus so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A red-tailed hawk in the Bronx, a great horned owl in Queens and a swan in Brooklyn have also fallen victim to the deadly flu, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in cases led Gov.

They go after the birds. That’s what they do,” Massaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;More than a dozen ducks and wild birds at the Queens and Bronx zoos are believed to have been recently killed by the virus. Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 500,000 stray cats wandering throughout the five boroughs, Massaro theorized the flu might have already breached the feline population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cats become infected, they show signs of respiratory illness such as sneezing and difficulty breathing, as well as severe depression and even seizures, &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet known if cats can spread the disease to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cats have an increased risk if they are in contact with poultry or dairy cows on farms or in backyard flocks, are exposed to sick or deceased wild birds, particularly waterfowl such as geese and ducks, consume unpasteurized dairy products or raw or undercooked poultry, including raw diets, or are in contact with people or other animals known to be infected with H5N1,” Dr. Stephanie Janeczko, vice president of shelter medicine services at the ASPCA, told The Post, adding that the overall risk to cats at the moment is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recommend that all cats exposed to H5N1 or those suspected of being infected with the virus should be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Gov.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Allegheny Health Network have developed a new method for deep brain stimulation. The technique, called "DeepFocus," uses transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) on the scalp and transnasal electrical stimulation (TnES) to achieve more accurate electrical stimulation in the brain. The findings are &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/adac0c" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neural Engineering&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;DeepFocus uses close proximity and highly conductive pathways offered by thin bones between the nasal cavity and brain to create larger and more accurate electric fields in deep brain regions than traditional scalp &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrode/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrode&lt;/a&gt; configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By going through the nose, we can place electrodes as close to the brain as possible without opening the skull," explained Mats Forssell, an electrical and computer engineering research scientist who is a lead author on the study. "We gain access to structures on the bottom of the brain which are hard to reach in other ways. That's what makes this technique so powerful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepFocus could enable more efficient and lower-risk targeting of deep brain structures to treat multiple neural conditions, including depression, PTSD, OCD, addiction, and substance abuse disorder. By targeting the brain's "reward circuit" (the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/orbitofrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, Brodmann area 25, amygdala, etc.) and managing environmental and time of day factors, DeepFocus could disrupt the brain's associations with cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepFocus could provide both short- and long-term treatments. Chronic treatments that require persistent stimulation could be delivered through an implant, while acute applications could be delivered in short sessions with endoscopic insertion and removal of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"The new approach affords access to parts of the brain that have been traditionally surgically challenging," said Boyle Cheng, a professor of neurosurgery at Allegheny Health Network's (AHN) Neuroscience Institute who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The innovation from the team provides exciting advances in the delivery of energy in terms of both safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the potential for better clinical treatments with fewer complications in patients with various neurological disorders is highly motivating."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for treating neurological conditions with implanted electrodes in the deep brain, but it requires a sophisticated surgical procedure to implant the system (electrodes, battery, and associated circuitry) which is highly invasive and carries risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection. This method also isn't steerable, which means the stimulation target cannot be changed once the electrodes are implanted inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early results of invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating neuropsychiatric conditions have been very promising," said Pulkit Grover, the senior author of this study and a professor of electrical and computer engineering, biomedical engineering, and CMU's Neuroscience Institute. "But the sophisticated surgery required for invasive DBS technology makes it unlikely to be widely adopted. Also, the invasive approach offers limited flexibility to clinicians after electrodes have been placed."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Noninvasive techniques such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/transcranial+magnetic+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (TMS), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) have lower risk and are steerable, but aren't as effective as implanted electrodes due to limited depth and resolution. TMS and TES can also cause high scalp pain because of more intense electric currents. DeepFocus offers a minimally invasive solution that is more accurate, less painful, and steerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexander Whiting, a neurosurgeon and the director of epilepsy surgery for AHN's Neuroscience Institute who worked on this study, said, "This new tool could be a game changer, offering the ability to treat deep areas of the brain in mental health disorders like depression, OCD, and addiction in a minimally invasive way that does not involve traditional incisions, or permanent placement of implanted hardware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside DeepFocus, researchers developed DeepROAST, a simulation and optimization platform used to carefully calibrate the injected currents in this new technique. DeepROAST simulates the effect of complex skull-base bones' geometries on the electric fields generated by DeepFocus using realistic head models. It optimizes the placement of electrodes on the scalp and in the nose, and helps electrical current injection patterns to be more accurate and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the DeepROAST platform, we can simulate how the electric field travels inside the brain realistically," said Yuxin Guo, a Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. student who worked on this research.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Moreover, DeepROAST automates and optimizes the placement of electrodes on the scalp and transnasally so that deep brain regions can be targeted with better efficiency and focality. This allows stimulation of deep brain targets that were previously difficult to access, enabling more precise interventions for conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grover added, "The U.S. is facing a severe mental health crisis, with PTSD, depression, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt; among the most pressing societal challenges. While surgically implanted &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/deep+brain+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;deep-brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; has shown promise, it lacks both widespread acceptance and the necessary FDA approvals for these conditions. Our minimally invasive, low-risk approach, which can be implemented in an outpatient setting, presents a scalable and widely applicable solution."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        It can be hard to feel sympathy for narcissists, who often lack empathy for others. But a new study sets the ground for, if not a sympathetic view, then a new way to look at those who are constantly aiming to defend their inflated ego, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/02/20/narcissists-study-psychology-ostracism-exclusion/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It finds that people with high narcissism scores who show a heightened sensitivity to social cues and a desire to dominate social situations feel more excluded than their peers—and often they are. Narcissists tend to be ostracized due to their aggression, arrogance, and tendency to view benign social cues as negative, researchers say. And this can exacerbate narcissistic traits over time, creating a "self-perpetuating cycle" of pain.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "Many people think of narcissism in terms of entitlement and arrogance, but our research highlights that narcissists also frequently experience social pain," lead study author Christiane Büttner, a postdoctoral researcher in social psychology at the University of Basel, tells the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. Her team focused on so-called grandiose or overt narcissists, who across large-scale surveys reported being ostracized more frequently than individuals with lower levels of narcissism, per &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/health/narcissism-social-exclusion-rejection-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. While experiments showed people often choose to avoid highly narcissistic individuals, these narcissists were more likely to perceive even ambiguous social interactions as deliberately exclusionary, per the study published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

                                        "Narcissism may contribute to social exclusion, but ostracism itself can also fuel the development of narcissistic traits," Büttner says in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-02-narcissists-ostracized.html?deviceType=desktop"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, "narcissists who are excluded may become even more narcissistic in response, potentially increasing their likelihood of future exclusion," she tells the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. The findings indicate that if we have to live with narcissists, it might be best to meet them head-on—in the proper setting. "Addressing these dynamics in structured ways, whether in workplaces, therapy, or social interactions, could help reduce the negative consequences of exclusion for both narcissistic individuals and those around them," says Büttner.

But not all snacks are equal. Well-balanced snacks can provide nutrients you need, reduce your appetite and curb overeating at your next meal. At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all snacks, even the ones some consider “bad,” can fit into a healthy eating pattern. What’s more, many of these snacks we've chosen to highlight are actually &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, especially if you’re working to lose weight.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you may be tempted to banish certain snacks in the name of weight loss because they've gotten a bad rap, know that well-planned snacks may actually support your health goals. “Snacks should have a combination of carbohydrates and protein to help you feel satisfied, give you energy and keep you full,” says Oklahoma City-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-d-78a88838/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katie Drakeford, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from carbohydrates and protein, choosing snacks with nutrients such as healthy fats and fiber may also support weight loss because they take longer to digest, which helps curb your appetite.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “People often feel the fat content of nuts makes them an indulgence. But once I explain nuts' magnificent benefits, they usually try them,” says &lt;a href="https://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a gut-health licensed nutritionist at Oswald Digestive Clinic in Minneapolis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a 2021 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9285885/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obesity Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, higher nut intake was associated with fat and weight loss. Nuts are best known for their healthy fats, high protein and fiber content, which are nutrients that help you feel full to curb hunger between meals. “I recommend people choose nuts with the highest-quality nutrition, such as macadamia, pecan, walnut, Brazil, hazelnut and almonds,” says Vaske.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Packing healthy foods on the go gets easier with dried fruit. “When mid-meal hunger strikes, reach for dried fruit like raisins, prunes, cherries or dates for a tasty and portable snack option,” says &lt;a href="https://www.bethstarknutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beth Stark, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Pennsylvania-based, Beth Stark Nutrition. Stark shares the weight-loss benefits of these snackable sweet bites. “Dried fruit is packed with essential vitamins, minerals and fiber to promote appetite satisfaction.” Look for no-added sugar varieties when shopping and be mindful of your portion size. If you’re eating dried fruits at home, pair them with sources of protein, such as cottage cheese or nuts, for longer-lasting appetite control, says Stark.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To increase the nutritional value of your chip snack, always pair it up with something that’s both tasty and nourishing. “Consider pairing chips with either salsa or Greek yogurt seasoned with lime juice, salt and pepper. Salsa elevates the taste and provides valuable nutrients such as fiber, lycopene, quercetin and capsaicin, which may reduce inflammation and support weight loss,” says Fink. Meanwhile, Greek yogurt adds protein, further assisting in appetite control,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasminilkay/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jasmin Ilkay, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and food communications expert in New York City.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a nutrient known for supporting weight loss, and you’ll find higher-fiber chips in the snack aisle, depending on how they’re made. “For a healthier choice, opt for chips made from cauliflower or beans,” says Ilkay.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on carbs is sometimes seen as the ultimate weight-loss hack, and while it may work for some, many people feel deprived of eating the snacks they enjoy, including crackers. Despite what people who follow a low-carb diet may say, eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/18002/6-carbs-to-add-to-your-diet-to-help-you-stay-slim/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;carbs can help you lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. “Crackers alone aren’t likely to keep someone full for long, but pairing them with a flavored tuna packet and an apple boosts the fullness factor by adding protein and fiber,” says Fink. Another idea is to smear crackers with hummus or nut butter for “a valuable source of protein and healthy fats, which can assist in stabilizing blood sugar levels and curbing hunger,” says Ilkay.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no denying the skepticism around eating bananas and losing weight. But bananas are too nutritious to avoid, and they are an easy and affordable snack. “Bananas are a rich dietary fiber and potassium source,” says Ilkay. Bananas (especially when green) have resistant starch, a type of fiber and prebiotic that enhances your gut health, and a healthier gut may aid in long-term weight management, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37503494/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “When bananas are combined with almonds and yogurt, this trio elevates the snack's protein content and provides beneficial monounsaturated fats. These components work together to assist in stabilizing blood sugar levels and promoting a longer-lasting feeling of fullness,” says Ilkay. When you're in the mood for something sweet, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262113/yogurt-banana-sundae/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Yogurt Banana Sundae&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not convinced snacking on cheese works for weight loss, maybe we can help. “If you crave savory foods for snacking, cheese is the way to go. Packed with protein, cheese digests and absorbs slowly to deliver maximum appetite satisfaction,” says Stark. Not to mention, cheese provides a wide variety of essential vitamins and minerals. “Cheese has an impressive nutrient profile that includes calcium, phosphorus, potassium and B12 that contribute to one’s overall health,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013604/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-cheese-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cheese has multiple health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also a rich source of calories and fat, so if you’re considering giving cheese a chance, here’s how to do it: “To incorporate cheese into your snack routine, try building a personal-sized charcuterie board with an ounce of your favorite cheese, along with fresh veggies, hummus and a few whole-grain crackers,” says Stark.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snacks don’t have to stifle your weight-loss goals. Well-planned snacks that include filling, satisfying and essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats and fiber can help make losing weight achievable and sustainable. “Being mindful of your snack portions is also imperative. Snacking wisely, instead of mindlessly, is key in meeting weight-loss goals,” adds Drakeford.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The sequences came from &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium that, like other bacteria, often skirmishes with viruses. Rumour had it that these sequences of &lt;small&gt;DNA&lt;/small&gt; might help bacteria gain the upper hand in the fight. If they did, the researchers wanted to know all about it. &lt;i&gt;S. thermophilus&lt;/i&gt; is one of the microbes used to make yogurt. Stopping it from falling prey to viruses would save Danisco, the foodmaker they worked for (later bought by Danone), millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:47:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

The virus has also been detected in dairy cows, raising further concerns about its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative said: "This is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Clifford, a former chief veterinary officer at the USDA, said: "It’s about developing a strategy that we can share with our trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would you still accept our broiler product if it’s not going to be vaccinated? Is there more reception to that? I don’t know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has signalled its receptiveness to a change in &lt;span id="74b6d179-85cb-49bb-9814-1b631b3841e3" class="suggested-link"&gt;bird flu&lt;/span&gt; policy, particularity whether chickens should be killed when the virus is identified in a flock, which is what currently happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA plans to release strategy to combat &lt;span id="220ec60b-7ce6-4cdc-b013-1caf389ba9a6" class="suggested-link"&gt;bird flu&lt;/span&gt; in the coming days, according go the rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any vaccine that was approved by them would need commercial approval and a clear distribution strategy for the some 300 million US currently hens at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="3"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="Woman selecting eggs at a grocery store." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="In the middle of this lies the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), who seem to be on the fence" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, 620px" srcset="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;In the middle of this lies the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), who seem to be on the fence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The US Sun</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:36:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOLWZVVUlTLVpnRjE3VGFGVUZ2T0l0QldBV3pFUkVfVXYxdTFNUE44bE9IbmZob2FhQkVSOU5WTFd3SzVWQ3NMYmowcG1MNVh0Ykp5Z0ZWRTRJV3pHQVE3eXl4dVUzNW8xekE3dFJwQkVzX19kaFluR1NHLWZtcXVSVzY0LTgwVnFiMlHSAY8BQVVfeXFMT3A2aE5IRHNaWkp1NTZfUWk2U1dYTk9KdUpURWlLOTJTQXJTMGhHM2ZOTkJ6TXFKT0V4aHh4WHpLVTdoaEFrc0owYTc2dngyZWtGMFg2Y2NPNnlpcU0wZnZhUWNsbXRSV0cwWUdjWkZqZVFhaDBXc0s4bHBBYjRNdVEzOGh0dnZBVDJLVVZKeE0</guid></item><item><title>Deadly motor-neuron disease treated in the womb in world 1st - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQSnNSSTlnNmlsSndHUUlEQTZ1QW9XNUgwVF9sOUpwLTBTM2JIMEVLUEl3QUxCS2ppNTc2Vlc0emxpUTYtcXBmTDZiN1cwVlhPQ2lsN2M3Y3V1OV9KaElHNkFwcE1Uemk4VnpVUTJTNmdGMmY5M05mVmJncnFiSS0zQlFNLUxIbTE2UkJxa2hla0xWN2FZR3VtS0h6Y1d3d2FEemJ4SjZBM1FaX1BrQ1Bz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child was treated for a rare, potentially deadly genetic disorder while still in the womb — and now, she has survived past the age of 2 with no signs of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the first time that this condition, called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), has ever been tackled before birth, according to a new report published Wednesday (Feb. 19) in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2300802" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2300802" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Over time, SMA eventually leads to the weakening and wasting away of the muscles. It's estimated to affect around 1 in every 10,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exceptionally rare disease that causes holes to form in your brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is usually caused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by mutations in a gene called SMN1, which contains instructions for how to make a protein called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/smn1/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/smn1/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;survival motor neuron (SMN) protein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This protein is critical for motor neurons to make proteins and grow the "wires" that send signals out to the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the SMN1 gene is mutated, the body cannot make enough SMN protein, and the nerves cannot adequately send out signals to muscles. As a result, the muscles — especially in the thighs, back, shoulders and hips — begin to weaken and shrink from disuse and a lack of nerve stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of these symptoms differs depending on the type of SMA a person has. There &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are five types of SMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked to SMN1 gene mutations, classified by symptom severity and by how early the symptoms appear. Earlier onset symptoms — which show up before or shortly after birth — typically lead to worse survival outcomes. Infants with SMA type 1, which manifests within six months after birth, develop severe weakness that causes difficulty breathing and swallowing, and they often die within the first few years of life without treatment or breathing support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMA type 1 is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading genetic cause of infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant involved in the recent case was found to be at risk for SMA type 1 after undergoing genetic testing in the womb. The parents had already had one child with confirmed SMA type 1 who had previously passed away. The tests revealed that the growing fetus also had mutations in the SMN1 genes on both &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug risdiplam (brand name: Evrysdi) is one of three treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SMA in infants. A tablet taken by mouth, it causes the body to boost the activity of a second gene, called SMN2, which also carries the instructions for building SMN protein but typically makes less than SMN1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, this drug had only been administered after birth, but in this case, the drug was given to the fetus in the womb upon request from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Richard Finkel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, told Nature News. Risdiplam is approved for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;children who are at least 2 months old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so the FDA gave special clearance for the drug's early use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 32 weeks of pregnancy, the mother started taking risdiplam daily for six weeks. Testing at the time of birth indicated that the drug had indeed been entering the baby's system while in the womb. Roughly one week after birth, the baby herself was given the drug orally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At birth, the infant was found to have higher levels of SMN protein and less nerve damage than other babies born with SMA type 1. In the months since her birth has shown no signs of abnormal muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's obviously very reassuring," Finkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child will likely have to take risdiplam for the rest of her life, into adulthood, and she will be closely monitored for any changes in her muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that this result is based on only a single case, but despite this, these findings indicate that SMA and other genetic conditions might be more effectively tackled if treatment is started before birth. They hope to investigate if these results can be replicated in larger studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This means modest weight reduction, reduced stress, a healthier diet, and more physical activity “can all work to restore normal function of the body’s organs and tissues,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How weight loss can reverse diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Weight loss&lt;b class="cXscX "&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the most effective way to induce diabetes remission because "insulin resistance is closely linked to high levels of visceral fat," says O.

Although we don't understand exactly how it occurs, Duru says, "we know that visceral fat communicates with the organs that absorb glucose from the blood, causing these organs to develop the insulin resistance that leads to type 2 diabetes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-is-bmi-inaccurate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;We’ve been measuring BMI since the 70s—but is the flawed metric still helpful?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is further evident as &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791310" target="_blank"&gt;longitudinal research&lt;/a&gt; shows that a high body mass index (BMI) significantly increases one's risk for type 2 diabetes.

These findings can then be applied to the more common form, late- onset Alzheimer’s disease to help slow progression earlier on.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study has identified protective genetic variants to resist the development and progression of DIAD, more studies need to be done to understand the underlying mechanisms,” Dao added. “Specifically, how do these variants restrict pathological tau spread? Understanding this can lead to development of novel therapeutic target treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:20:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOVmFSU0lhU213OHQtQmhHX09FN1V5LWFmOE9VWkFMbFBzbmxqTTdJMVJpOHB4MkI3TXd1c3BILWc2cHpPdUhiOC1FUFY5Q1RyZGE4SDFZc2UyZXBvbU9PVzJvc1VzOC1sdGttT1lPdkRjTHpOY204RUJuMkVxd0tFUHB1REp1TmJMRjVzeTlHTjRUSTA4WXBVc1BGTXRLQ1Q4R3dfTkplX185Z1VlOVVn</guid></item><item><title>If You're Getting Older, Eating This Fruit Can Prevent Muscle Loss, New Study Finds - Best Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5faE53MHB6YmJkWk1YZjEzOGhOdzZxdFp1RFFoaGNlbW5qaE5MWXhxcGlDajJpYmpZbWFPWm5nbW94ZEVidVdEWmlhVUg4Y0czQ3pRc1l1X1A3NUxxMWc4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-modal-body" id="sTop_Bar_0_0_23_0_0_13_1"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 86 65" fill="none"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_10068_937)"&gt;&lt;path d="M83.0003 61.8788V2.99927H3.00058V61.8788H83.0003Z" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M3.74396 3.74927L38.2558 38.7207C40.8139 41.2985 45.4686 41.268 47.9726 38.7442L82.4608 4.03073" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M4.92966 59.9398L31.3724 32.9077" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M80.7678 59.6279L55.038 33.2822" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_10068_937"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h3 class="newsletter-modal__headline"&gt;Best Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text-medium"&gt;

New research suggests overuse of products like whey powder or creatine may be affecting young people’s mental health as well as their their physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Canadian study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, finds that young people who consume multiple muscle-building products are more likely to show symptoms of a condition called muscle dysphoria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 2,730 Canadian teens and adults ages 16–30, mostly white males and females, were recruited via Instagram and Snapchat advertisements. They were asked about their use of six different common workout products — amino acids, creatine monohydrate, pre-workout drinks or powders, protein bars, weight or mass gainers, and whey protein shakes or powders. Protein bars were the most commonly consumed, followed by whey protein shakes or powders and creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also asked about body image, asking for responses to statements such as, “I feel like I have too much body fat” or “I feel depressed when I miss one or more workout days.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether they used supplements or not, 26% of the boys and men scored above the level for muscle dysmorphia — that is, being extremely preoccupied with a perceived lack of muscle mass or tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the workout supplements and products was associated with more symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, what the researchers called greater “drive for size” (the desire to have bigger muscles) and “functional impairment” (the inability to work or maintain a social life). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On the positive side, young people who used supplements were generally satisfied with how their bodies were responding to them, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys and young men can be susceptible to fixating on their muscles, which can lead to obsessive thoughts and exercising to build muscle — weightlifting for many hours a day, for example — to the point it interferes with daily life, &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/profiles/kyle-t-ganson/" target="_blank"&gt;Kyle Ganson&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and assistant professor of clinical social work at the University of Toronto, said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not known how many people in general are affected by this kind of body dissatisfaction, but it’s thought to be “quite rampant in the gym space,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ganson said the findings reflect data and trends seen in the U.S. as well. About&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335522000857?via%3Dihub#ab010" target="_blank"&gt; 55% adolescents and young men in the U.S. &lt;/a&gt;use bodybuilding supplements, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association and lobbying group that represents businesses that manufacture supplements, said in a statement released after the study: "The most obvious explanation is that people who are dissatisfied with their appearance take steps to change it. That might mean adjusting their diet, exercising more, or taking supplements to support their goals. In fact, the study itself found that supplement users were actually more satisfied with their progress than non-users." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said the findings spotlight how unrealistic body ideals — often fueled by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=muscle%20growth%20supplement&amp;amp;t=1739811742505" target="_blank"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; who promote or sell workout supplements online — may be driving more children and young adults to overuse powders or pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t help that many fitness influencers use filters that deceive others into thinking their appearance is real or naturally attainable, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/jesse-mills" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jesse Mills&lt;/a&gt;, a urologist and men’s health specialist with UCLA Health, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a global trend towards anime-like figures and cartoonish proportions,” Mills said. “I really think body dysmorphia in general is the new pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a study Ganson published last year, nearly half of respondents said &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt;online influencers who promoted workout supplements &lt;/a&gt;were a “primary” motivation for their own use of the products. The hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/creatine" target="_blank"&gt;#creatine&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has over 382,000 posts, many of which are flagged with “creator earns commission” warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The pressure to meet muscular body standards may motivate young men and boys to use supplements more often, to the point where “it’s like second nature,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Interestingly, among girls and women, supplement use was also associated with stronger desires for bigger, more toned muscles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study’s findings underscore the dangerous reality that “companies are profiting off the mental health distress of young people,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/eating-disorders-striped/team/bryn-austin/" target="_blank"&gt;S. Bryn Austin&lt;/a&gt;, a social epidemiologist and behavioral scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “We have a public health problem here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, these companies don’t have to prove their products’ safety before hitting the market, Bryn added. Some bodybuilding supplements have been found to be contaminated with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/caution-bodybuilding-products-can-be-risky" target="_blank"&gt;prescription drugs, anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt; and toxic heavy metals like lead and cadmium, according to a &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/wp-content/uploads/CleanLabelProject_ProteinStudyWhitepaper_010625.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent report by the Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Evidence is mixed whether the supplements do all they claim, like enhance athletic performance and improve muscle stamina. But when used appropriately, many of the ingredients in muscle-building supplements such as whey protein are safe. Some, like creatine, have been&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt; shown to boost muscle mass &lt;/a&gt;and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Using supplements isn’t “inherently problematic,” Ganson said. Once started, though, “it’s kind of like a Pandora’s box,” especially for boys and young men who often turn to social media for advice. “That’s why you should be careful when taking these supplements; they can only support your goals in so many ways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mills, the men's health specialist, cautioned that, for some young men, supplement powders may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Imagine you’re an impressionable 18- to 25-year-old who’s working out but not seeing the gains that other guys have,” said Mills, who emphasized that genetics can make it harder for some people to grow muscle. “That is certainly a gateway to, ‘what else is out there?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Bryn’s team conducted a study published last year in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827804" target="_blank"&gt;journal JAMA Network &lt;/a&gt;Open that followed 4,000 boys and young men ages 10–27 over 14 years. The group found that people who used muscle-building supplements were eight times more likely to start anabolic steroids compared to those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Steroids are “an incredibly effective way to put on lots of mass in a very little bit of time,” Mills said. Because even low doses are associated with side effects, this dangerous mental and physical cycle has become a “public health concern.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:14:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNZHFtcEhIVmppUjM4YWw0N0FaNTRwcEp5ZmJpVEJBQVZnRE5kbnJuNHpwd0dPRlVNdDhNZF8zRjZNV1BDRXZFSkRXdVZNeWJUOXhUMUFXLXlOa0NqVUo4NnhRTUtwdTN5MEtjNWNzMlJXbTdhYk1fdlJvamdkYnQzV2tjVnBSenlGZUk1cV9hRHJnYUcxSXlpaTExazhQR215bnBCbDlxc0F0d1EyNm55MEI1dFZuRDFjbmfSAVZBVV95cUxNT05yNy1wcWxGcnpFYnVpeFFyd3lJcjA4LWFMRFozVUxoS1l1SzY0Ni1uRU5Bc0FRSGM3OGVpSHZxMm5JM2ZjcDFXVjVibHMtNFU1TXY1UQ</guid></item><item><title>Report: RFK Jr. Planning to Remove Advisors on Vaccine Committee - Medpage Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5YT3BzX3ZQRTFEVXZMdU9OYnBMZlZpYm5OZWlOZXJYYjN2T1BkOV92b1BlMlJuRWE3SU1ESWVpTUlsZTE0WEhVSHlyZGl0U1c5M2U3cC1KaThJWG1oaUZCM2NNbFZxZVJTYkFfRUNQUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content-region mpt-article-page" id="js-main-content-region" itemtype="http://schema.org/articleBody" itemid="#main-content-region"&gt;
                                            
    
        
    
            
        
                            &lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to be planning major changes to the way his department oversees vaccines, media outlets are reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is planning to remove several members of CDC's vaccine advisory committee due to what he sees as conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The secretary &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" target="_blank"&gt;has previously said&lt;/a&gt; that he is concerned about the drug industry's relationship with regulators. The process of reviewing committee members has just started, and there is no firm timeline for the removals, nor is it known how many people will be removed, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACIP Meeting Postponed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key committee involved in overseeing vaccine use is the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). That committee was scheduled to have a meeting next week, but that meeting &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/114303" target="_blank"&gt;has been postponed&lt;/a&gt; and no new date has been announced. The postponement &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;triggered a letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (DSA), and several other medical groups urging the Trump administration to reschedule the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ACIP had a full agenda of critical, vaccine-related decisions, including discussion linked to deadly illnesses like meningococcal disease," said the letter, which was addressed to Kennedy as well as the acting CDC director, Susan Monarez, PhD, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-La.), chair of the powerful Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter noted that the online portal for public comments  --  which is usually made available prior to ACIP meetings  --  was not available for this one. "Rescheduling this critical meeting and reconciling the absent portal for public remarks would represent a meaningful early follow-through from the Trump administration and its new HHS secretary to ensure Americans receive the information needed to protect themselves against vaccine-preventable illnesses," the letter concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, delaying the meeting "delays vital discussions and needed decisions on a variety of vaccines by trusted and well-vetted experts," IDSA President Tina Tan, MD, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;. "ACIP relies on a well-established, transparent, and evidence-based process for evaluating the optimal use of vaccines that play a critical role in strengthening public health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns About Kennedy's Actions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Kennedy might remove some of the members of ACIP has Georges Benjamin, MD, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, "very worried."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the reasons we opposed him  --  we knew he was lying when he said he was not going to touch this group in particular," Benjamin said in a phone interview. He added that although it's not uncommon for administrations to change members of these committees and he "doesn't want to overstate" his concerns, Kennedy "has views we don't trust on conflict of interest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee members are "thoroughly vetted for conflict and balanced in terms of views," Benjamin said. And contrary to Kennedy's assertion that the committees aren't properly constructed, "they are properly constructed  --  while you might change the people [on them], I don't know how you can not have people with a similar kind of mix."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up, and the owner of a family medicine practice. One committee member, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they were informed of the meeting's postponement from news reports, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, President Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that required "the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy [to] identify and submit to the president additional unnecessary governmental entities and federal advisory committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary." Because ACIP is a federal advisory committee, it would be one of the committees under review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's views on vaccines were a subject of controversy during &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114003" target="_blank"&gt;his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Finance Committee. "Committee staff have examined thousands of pages of statements, books, and podcast transcripts in a review of his record, and the receipts show that Mr. Kennedy has embraced conspiracy theories, quacks, and charlatans, especially when it comes to the safety and efficacy of vaccines," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Kennedy is fond of saying he's not making recommendations about whether parents should vaccinate their children  --  he's just asking questions and giving people choices," Wyden added. "It's a slippery tactic to dodge any real responsibility for his words and actions, and it is, in my view, absurd, coming from somebody who's trying to win confirmation for a job that is entirely about making recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy tried to lay to rest concerns that he was anti-vaccine. "I believe that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare," he said. "All of my kids are vaccinated. I've written many books on vaccines. My first book in 2014, the first line of it is, 'I am not anti-vaccine,' and the last line is, 'I am not anti-vaccine.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceasing of Some Vaccine Campaigns Ordered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to remove advisors may conflict with &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/washington-watch/114079" target="_blank"&gt;a number of promises Kennedy made&lt;/a&gt; to Cassidy that cinched Cassidy's "Yes" vote on Kennedy's confirmation. Most of the pledges revolved around vaccines, including that Kennedy will work within current approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems. Kennedy also told Cassidy he would maintain recommendations from ACIP without changes, and said that statements that vaccines don't cause autism won't be removed from the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to those promises, Kennedy "committed that the [HELP Committee chair] may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety," Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/5154258" target="_blank"&gt;said in remarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate floor on Feb. 4th. "If he is confirmed, HHS will provide 30-day notice to the HELP Committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs, and the HELP Committee will have the option to call a hearing for further review."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will use my authority as HELP Committee chair to rebuff any attempt to remove the public's access to lifesaving vaccines without ironclad causational scientific evidence that can be accepted and defended before the mainstream scientific community and before Congress," Cassidy added. "I will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidence and anecdote. But my support is built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of Kennedy's possible plans for advisory committees came as the CDC was told to stop some of its promotional campaigns for vaccines, including its "Wild to Mild" flu vaccination campaign, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. An HHS official told the CDC that Kennedy wanted advertisements that promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making instead, according to the story. A search for "Wild to Mild" on the CDC website turned up a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Fshareable-resources%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;2023 press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the campaign but little else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The Queen’s had an attack of gout! Hurry!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So exclaimed the crotchety Mrs Meg in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite, in which Olivia Colman plays a moribund and overweight Queen Anne. The queen was afflicted with, among many other conditions, gout – a disorder which causes joint inflammation and severe pain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the film, while screaming out in pain, her swollen feet are wrapped in strips of soothing beef. The next day her soon-to-be new favourite, Abigail, collects wild herbs to make a poultice for her. A bit more effective than raw steak, she finds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to feel sorry for Queen Anne. She really didn’t have much of a chance, since doctors of her day had no options for treating gout other than quackery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She may have been subject to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40674-015-0012-9"&gt;many other absurd treatments&lt;/a&gt; of the time to alleviate the symptoms, like scorching the blood vessels supplying the feet, slathering them in goose fat, or bloodletting with leeches. By the time she passed away in 1714 aged just 49, death may have come as a welcome relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queen Anne wasn’t the only member of royalty to suffer with gout. Prince Regent George (later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1007301/"&gt;George IV&lt;/a&gt;) was similarly afflicted. Gout, then, came to be associated with the aristocracy and over indulgence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout still affects many people. In fact, it is estimated that in 2020 gout affected &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(24)00117-6/fulltext"&gt;nearly 56 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that’s predicted to grow to 96 million by 2050. So, a condition that was once considered the disease of kings and queens is a now a disease of the masses, with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21169841/"&gt;younger patients&lt;/a&gt; also being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, raw meat strips and herbs are no longer required. We now know much more about how to treat gout and how to prevent it recurring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding gout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout&lt;/a&gt; is a crystal arthropathy – a group of joint disorders that occur when crystals build up in joints and soft tissues. Gout develops when uric acid levels rise in the bloodstream, before infiltrating the joints where it solidifies and becomes needle-like crystals that inflame the joints, making them incredibly sore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I say “sore”, &lt;a href="https://patient.info/foot-care/gout-leaflet"&gt;I really do mean sore&lt;/a&gt;: many people who experience gout often describe it as one of the worst pains they have ever felt. It most commonly affects &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/gout"&gt;the big toe&lt;/a&gt; and it can make even the lightest touch to the  skin unbearable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some gout patients sleep with a &lt;a href="https://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/leaflets/title/advice-for-managing-gout-2/#What_can_I_do_to_manage_gout"&gt;special cage&lt;/a&gt; over their foot that lifts up the bedclothes because they can’t bear even the weight of a bed sheet on the affected joint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout can affect other joints. It may also cause “tophi” to develop (hard swellings around joints and the ears).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The Gout by James Gillray. Published May 14th 1799.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout typically occurs in bouts or attacks, before settling with treatment and becoming dormant. But it can reoccur, requiring more acute treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diagnosis of gout is based around the classic symptoms: excruciating pain, 
swelling in and around the affected joint and redness. Microscopic examination of the fluid taken from the swollen joint may also show crystals and there is usually raised uric acid levels on blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High uric acid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High uric acid levels are usually linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39702222/"&gt;alcohol excess, obesity, diabetes and hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/gout-diet-foods-to-eat-and-avoid"&gt;diet high in purine-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; has been found to have the strongest association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks"&gt;Purines&lt;/a&gt; are compounds comprised of uric acid. &lt;a href="https://www.ukgoutsociety.org/docs/goutsociety-allaboutgoutanddiet-0113.pdf"&gt;Purine-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include meat and offal, oily fish like mackerel and anchovies, and yeasty foods, like Marmite and beer. It may be a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/healthy-eating/which-foods-are-safe-for-gout"&gt;avoid these foods&lt;/a&gt; in excess if you suffer from frequent episodes of gout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dietary changes alone are unlikely to stave off symptoms of gout. &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng219"&gt;Medications&lt;/a&gt; can treat both an acute episode of gout and prevent it recurring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the joints are inflamed, options include anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, naproxen, or steroid medications. Another option is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/colchicine/"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically used for short periods and can be very effective – though it commonly causes &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/63/4/936/7455266"&gt;bouts of diarrhoea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the inflammation has settled down, it is important to prevent future attacks. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/allopurinol/"&gt;Allopurinol&lt;/a&gt; can reduce uric acid levels and therefore the risk of further bouts. There’s also evidence to suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/healthy-eating/are-cherries-cure-for-gout"&gt;eating cherries&lt;/a&gt; or drinking &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cherry-juice-for-gout"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; could reduce the risk of gout attacks, especially if &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3510330/"&gt;combined with alloprinol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay free of gout then perhaps it’s time to consider taking preventative action by making subtle lifestyle modifications. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, cut down on alcohol and avoid binge drinking, take regular exercise and keep yourself well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that experiencing shame or guilt while using psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms, is surprisingly common, affecting about two out of every three users. However, the study also offered a positive perspective, indicating that how well individuals process these difficult emotions, rather than the intensity of the feelings themselves, is linked to their wellbeing in the weeks following the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in psychedelic substances for potential therapeutic uses has largely focused on the positive outcomes and transformative experiences they can induce. However, researchers recognized that a complete understanding of psychedelics requires acknowledging the full spectrum of experiences, including the challenging ones. Historically, negative experiences, sometimes casually referred to as “bad trips,” have been somewhat sidelined in both public conversation and scientific exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists sought to address this gap in knowledge by specifically examining the occurrence of shame and guilt during psilocybin experiences. They were interested in understanding how often these feelings arise, what factors might predict them, and how these emotions relate to a person’s overall wellbeing after using psilocybin. The researchers hypothesized that while psychedelics are sometimes thought to reduce self-focused thinking, they might also, in some cases, bring feelings of shame and guilt to the forefront. This could be due to the profound self-reflection and emotional intensity that these substances can trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work came from me witnessing firsthand the complex ways that psychedelics could affect people — who were sometimes challenged in ways they couldn’t even find language to describe,” said study author David Mathai, the medical director of &lt;a href="https://sattvamedicine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sattva Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and a clinical assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those experiences reminded me of clients that I have seen working as a mental health clinician in traditional settings who struggled with feelings of shame and guilt. I began to realize this was an underexplored but critically important area when it came to understanding psychedelic use, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed a study that tracked individuals planning to use psilocybin in their everyday lives, outside of a controlled clinical setting. They recruited 679 adults who were proficient in English and at least 18 years old through online advertisements and word of mouth. These participants were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at different points in time surrounding their planned psilocybin experience. The study was conducted over a period of two years, from July 2020 to July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questionnaires were administered at six different time points: two weeks before, one day before, one to three days after, two to four weeks after, and two to three months after their psilocybin use. The initial survey, completed two weeks beforehand, gathered demographic information and used established psychological scales to measure baseline levels of trait shame (a person’s general tendency to feel shame), anxiety (both current and general), depression, past adverse childhood experiences, and cognitive flexibility (the ability to adapt thinking and behavior). Just before their psilocybin experience, participants were asked if they would have a guide or sitter present and completed a questionnaire assessing their level of psychological surrender or anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days immediately following their psilocybin use, participants were asked to rate whether they considered the experience to be ultimately positive or negative. They also completed questionnaires measuring the intensity of any mystical-type experiences and challenging experiences they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially for this study, they also filled out a questionnaire designed to assess feelings of state shame and guilt – that is, shame and guilt experienced specifically during the psilocybin session. This questionnaire was slightly modified to directly ask about these feelings in the context of their psychedelic experience. For those who reported experiencing any shame or guilt, additional questions were asked about how long these feelings lasted, how difficult they were, and whether they felt they were able to constructively process these emotions during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two to four weeks after their psilocybin use, participants were again asked to complete the trait shame questionnaire and to rate any lasting changes in their personal wellbeing or life satisfaction resulting from the psilocybin experience. Finally, two to three months after their psilocybin use, they completed the trait shame questionnaire one last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathai and his colleagues found that feelings of shame or guilt during psilocybin use were indeed common. Almost 70% of participants reported experiencing either shame or guilt at some point during their session. Specifically, about 56% reported shame, and approximately 52% reported guilt. For a small percentage, about 12%, these feelings were reported at the highest possible intensity. The duration of these feelings varied, but for most, they lasted between 10 minutes and an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only factor that consistently predicted experiencing shame or guilt was age. Younger participants were more likely to report higher levels of both shame and guilt during their psilocybin experience. Other factors, including pre-existing levels of trait shame, anxiety, depression, or past adverse childhood experiences, did not reliably predict acute shame or guilt during the psychedelic session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant finding was the link between processing shame and guilt and later wellbeing. The study found that the degree to which participants felt they could constructively work through feelings of shame or guilt during the psilocybin experience was a significant predictor of their wellbeing two to four weeks later. In fact, individuals who reported being very capable of processing these emotions during their session actually reported higher levels of wellbeing and mystical experience compared to those who did not experience shame or guilt at all. This suggests that navigating challenging emotions during a psychedelic experience, and finding a way to process them, may be connected to positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to see that individuals who were most able to work through feelings of shame or guilt during psilocybin use had the highest mystical experience and wellbeing ratings, even compared to individuals who did not experience those feelings whatsoever,” Mathai told PsyPost. “It may be that a certain degree of contact with psychologically challenging material during psychedelic use allows for greater overall benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of longer-term effects, the study found that, on average, psilocybin use was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in trait shame that was maintained for at least two to three months after the experience. However, it is important to note that this was an average trend. While most participants showed a decrease in trait shame, a notable minority, about 30%, actually experienced an increase in their general level of shame. This highlights the variable nature of psychedelic experiences and their potential impact on individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are three main takeaways based on our study aims,” Mathai summarized. “1) Acute feelings of shame and guilt may occur more commonly than people expect during psilocybin use and are very difficult to predict; 2) The ability to constructively work through shame and guilt when they arise seems to predict well being for individuals, rather than the magnitude of those feelings; 3) Psilocybin was shown to decrease trait shame on average but increased shame in some individuals, suggesting the importance of appropriate psychological support for psychedelic use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shame is a difficult construct to research, and different ways of measuring it may lead to different outcomes,” Mathai noted. “Unfortunately, we were unable to characterize patients’ specific experiences of shame and what it looked like to work through these feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build upon these findings by examining shame and guilt in more controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy.Further research could also explore whether different psychedelic substances elicit different types of challenging emotions and investigate the role of cultural background and diversity in these experiences. Understanding how to best support individuals in processing difficult emotions like shame and guilt during psychedelic experiences could be essential for maximizing the potential benefits and minimizing potential harms associated with these powerful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An important next step would be to use mixed-methods and qualitative analysis to better characterize shame-related experiences with psilocybin,” Mathai explained. “It would also be valuable to replicate this research in more carefully controlled clinical trial settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings and other emerging research, the activation of challenging emotions and memories with psychedelics could pose a unique and context-dependent learning condition for both therapeutic and detrimental forms of reconsolidation. This is an important consideration that deserves further study as we think about optimal safety and support for psychedelic use. However, it’s also worth pointing out that these types of experiences and their potential outcomes are not likely to be detected by the questionnaires routinely used in psychedelic drug development trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2025.2461997"&gt;Shame, Guilt and Psychedelic Experience: Results from a Prospective, Longitudinal Survey of Real-World Psilocybin Use&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by David S.

                    &lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/1/pgae543/7960038"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt; found that our mouth microbiome can help identify early signs of cognitive decline. The researchers determined that specific kinds of oral bacteria are associated with cognitive impairment, specifically memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease.  By analyzing the oral microbiome, dentists can potentially offer a unique and non-invasive method for assessing the risk of developing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed the oral microbiome of 110 people over the age of 50 in the U.K., according to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63833506/mouth-bacteria-alzheimers-risk-study/"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/a&gt;.  One group had no decline in brain function while the second group had mild cognitive impairment. The group with good memory function had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus in their mouths. The second group had higher levels of the bacteria Porphyromonas, common in periodontal disease, and were more likely to suffer memory problems. The researchers noted that the bacteria Prevotella, which is also commonly found in periodontal disease, is also associated with individuals who have the APOE4 gene, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that bacteria in the mouth can trigger inflammation, which then travels to the brain, causing dementia. Another possibility is that when the bacteria is imbalanced, it can impact the formation of nitric acid from the nitrate found in the diet from sources such as vegetables. Nitric acid helps boost memory and communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say it’s too soon to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between oral microbiome and Alzheimer’s, but other researchers believe it’s possible. A study conducted by a team from the &lt;a href="https://www.dental.columbia.edu/news/cdm-researcher-finds-link-between-oral-health-and-dementia"&gt;Columbia College of Dental Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a “clear link between poor periodontal health and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bramen, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, suggests that eating nitrate-rich foods like vegetables can “benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top researcher Panos N. Papapanou, a professor of dental medicine, who was one of the scientists who found the link between periodontal health and Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, warns that periodontitis is highly prevalent among elderly Americans, and especially among those who have limited access to oral healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are data that demonstrate that people who take care of their oral health have lower general health care expenditures,” he says. “Taking care of your mouth is important for your oral health and function, but also an integral part of general wellbeing as people age.”&lt;/p&gt;

While for others, hunger cues start as soon as the alarm goes off in the morning. Turns out, there’s a lot your body might be trying to tell you if you’re waking up hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunger is the body’s way of signaling it needs fuel, but it can offer a few clues about other aspects of your health and lifestyle, too. How hungry you feel in the morning can be a matter of dehydration, over- or under-eating the night before, what you ate the night before and how well you slept — all things you can remedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not better or worse to wake up hungry. Hunger is our body’s natural response to when blood sugar is low to stimulate you to eat and keep the blood sugar higher,” Dr. Deena Adimoolam, a specialist in endocrinology and obesity medicine, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, if you find yourself ravenous in the mornings, nauseated or disrupted in the middle of the night because of hunger, there might be something more serious going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to wake up hungry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People might worry when they wake up hungry because they think it means they didn’t eat enough the night before or that they’ll be prone to overeating at breakfast, but “waking hungry is perfectly normal,” says registered dietitian Natalie Rizzo, TODAY.com’s nutrition editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This is especially true if the last meal you ate before bed was dinner, she adds. “For example, if you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and then go to bed at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m., you have fasted for 12 hours. Being hungry after a 12-hour fast is normal! And while there’s nothing wrong with eating after dinner, limiting food in the hours before bed leads to better sleep and less indigestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What you eat is as big a factor as when you eat. “The type of food you eat at night definitely plays a role in how you feel the next morning,” says Rizzo. “If you eat a small meal that doesn’t have enough protein or fat, it won’t curb your appetite and can lead to extreme feelings of hunger that night or the next morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those hunger pangs first thing can also be the result of lack of sleep or a sign of dehydration, Dr. Reshmi Srinath, an endocrinologist for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, tells TODAY.com. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re routinely waking up hungry which, again, isn’t necessarily a bad thing, here are some other possible reasons, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're taking a medication that increases appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You had a bowel movement overnight or late at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're exercising more than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You consumed more alcohol than usual the night before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does waking up hungry mean you have high cortisol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are no studies showing that hormonal causes are contributing to morning hunger,” says Srinath, but it's a widely spread belief. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, naturally spikes in the morning. Like other hormones, cortisol levels rise with the sun and fall throughout the day leading to a slump around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. and then sleepiness at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While cortisol can impact day-to-day functioning if levels are especially high, Srinath says, there’s no correlation between the hormone and a.m. hunger.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does waking up hungry say about your metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After a night of sleep, it might feel as if your last meal wasn’t all that long ago, but the hours you spend getting shuteye are enough to work up an appetite and break down the calories from the night before. If you’re waking up hungry, it’s likely not the result of a fast or high-functioning metabolism, the experts say, but a normal occurrence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is waking up hungry a concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If waking up hungry is bothersome or especially distracting in the mornings, the experts suggest hydrating more, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-times-to-eat-rcna58563" target="_blank"&gt;timing your dinner later&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating more fiber and protein into your diet so that you’re more satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If morning hunger accompanies headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, brain fog or sweat, Adimoolam suggests a 15-gram serving of “fast-acting sugar” to get your blood sugar levels up and hold you over until breakfast. Some options she suggests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or corn syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4–6 ounces of juice or regular soda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roughly 3–4 glucose tablets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 dose of glucose gel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approximately 3 pieces of hard or gummy candies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Consider reaching out to a doctor, however, if you’re regularly hungry in the morning and your blood sugar falls below 70 mg/dL, says Adimoolam. Chronic low blood sugar can be associated with conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same goes for hunger that disrupts your sleep. “If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel extreme hunger pangs in your stomach, there’s a good chance you aren’t eating enough,” adds Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This may happen when someone is trying to lose weight, but extreme hunger is never good for anyone. It’s fine to wake up hungry and be excited about eating breakfast. But if you’re waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. and feel like you could eat a huge meal, you may want to look at your overall eating patterns,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5NYmpFOGhlSzlSX3hOd0FCMmM1R2VKODVFcFYxQ0NJSzJFYkl0YjZ3bElTQTVrRU5oSEliaDlxOVdPSUpsMlJoQW54aWE2VzhHMmg2cTdaUzN5NHY3ck5lZU93bWVXeEpGdU02b2Y1LXDSAVRBVV95cUxNZUZOTTctUDRLdjlhd1ZvcEQzcTNTWjU1VnJucG51czh5WElHLXh4Mk00aGE5aWtFYTRRNU41LXZjWm1fXzBNdDdWeFpCV0JtNloyTjk</guid></item><item><title>Waking up hungry?

and has over 25 years of clinical research under her belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Bowring often takes to her TikTok to share her advice on longevity and staying healthy, and this time was no different, as she offered viewers four new pointers to keeping your body in tip-top shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tip number one is to get out in the sun without sunblock on, without your sunglasses,' Dr. Bowring shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is so important to get natural sunlight exposure on as much of your body as possible to help prevent disease,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight#benefits"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside and being in the sun is good for you, as it can boost your mood and Vitamin D levels, which is beneficial for bone health, immune function, and even muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, per the&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aad.org/media/stats-sunscreen#:~:text=Dermatologists%20recommend%20using%20sunscreen%20on,not%20just%20during%20the%20summer."&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She also recommended taking cold showers because they 'help with your mitochondrial health' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/blog/2022/picked-at-their-peak-the-benefits-of-buying-seasonal-produce/"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, eating produce that is in season and 'picked at its peak' can be beneficial to your health, as the food will be packed with more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is really important because sunlight imprints like a barcode on our food, based on that energy from the sun and we can better metabolize our foods if we're eating in the right season,' Dr. Bowring shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the comments section of her video, many thanked her for the tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Love these tips, so simple yet not so obvious,' one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another agreed, 'Great list.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQOVVHVUExb2Uwdy1sNnR4cUJEZUxSZlo3LUNkMjYwdVlLMVF1aDJOY0lpdzB3NWVqME42TUltQnlpYkxESllHWDNMTnMxakVCUWZNQ3dfbVNOUEdQeXZIM3NkUXVTSHMyTndKVmlrMnFtZENzZVc0T2xiOF9OaUx5emdBcHlrTXV0X1o0WC1CNjBKakdYUEVHMXF6bkxoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOR2hSTFhKckVyYjQxRlF5YUJ4OFQzR1JqcW1VWGxFbWJHSUxndUlaMGhEbVRYVzk5empPOWEyLXlKamVTdmN0V2hXeXQtLUUwNWNTNm1LdDFRNXg1SkFLYzYyS2xqWkdZRHhldWlRM3J3azRIZjJYLUVNbVJPQ3lTZFV2V2U1YU9tNC1taWxQeXdGV3BqMWFlS2MxekNtOEZhWjcw</guid></item><item><title>Eating grapes every day can transform your body in a unique way - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle health plays a vital role in overall well-being, affecting strength, mobility, and longevity. While exercise and protein intake have long been the cornerstones of muscle maintenance, new research suggests that diet alone may have a powerful influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from Western New England University (WNE) has introduced an unexpected player in muscle health – grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that consuming grapes daily could alter muscle gene expression, potentially enhancing strength and resilience. These findings offer a new perspective on how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/resveratrol-may-boost-female-fertility-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural foods&lt;/a&gt; impact the body at a genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people struggling with age-related muscle loss, the potential benefits of grapes in maintaining muscle function are both exciting and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exceeding-nutritional-benefits"&gt;Exceeding nutritional benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, people around the world consume approximately 30 million tons of grapes, making them one of the most widely eaten fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they are valued for their rich nutritional content, their health benefits extend well beyond basic nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research has shown that grapes positively impact various aspects of health, including cardiovascular function, kidney health, and skin vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, grapes contain compounds that support eye health by protecting against oxidative stress, which can contribute to vision decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their role in gastrointestinal health is also noteworthy, as grapes promote digestion and contribute to a balanced gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health advantages&lt;/a&gt;, grapes have become more than just a tasty fruit – they are a natural source of essential compounds that support overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grapes-change-muscle-genes"&gt;Grapes change muscle genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, researchers have shed light on the dynamic influence daily grape consumption exerts on muscle gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects are significantly more profound in females, which intriguingly brings male and female muscle characteristics closer to each other at a metabolic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes tied to lean muscle mass showed an upward trend, while those related to muscle degeneration displayed a decline, pointing towards improved muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations open up potential pathways for tackling age-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-muscles-may-soon-be-able-to-regenerate-like-other-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; loss, a challenge faced by 10-16% of elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Pezzuto, senior investigator of the study, is the Dean of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at &lt;a href="https://wne.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Western New England University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence that grapes have the potential to enhance muscle health at the genetic level,” noted Dr. Pezzuto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given their safety profile and widespread availability, it will be exciting to explore how quickly these changes can be observed in human trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-grapes-affect-muscles"&gt;How do grapes affect muscles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fascinating field of nutrigenomics discusses the influence of diet on gene expression and the corresponding impact of genetic variation on dietary responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how daily intake of two servings of grapes impacted genetic expression patterns within muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the male and female muscles that usually exhibit significant differences converged into a unified phenotype under the grape-inclusive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA of a single species, including humans, doesn’t vary notably from one individual to another. However, the primary factor that sets us apart is the expression of DNA, otherwise known as the phenotype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingestion of grapes brought about changes in the phenotypic gene expression of male and female muscle, predominantly in females, resulting in an aligned metabolic parameter between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another fascinating observation, specific genes linked with favorable muscle health – such as lean muscle mass – were enhanced. At the same time, genes associated with deteriorating muscle health were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to conduct further studies to understand the specific biological processes responsible for these genetic changes in muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aim to determine how quickly these changes occur after regular grape consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon, scientists can better assess how grapes contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-fuels-neuron-growth-through-muscle-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; and whether their effects vary among different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrigenomics advances, this study represents a significant step toward developing new dietary strategies for maintaining muscle strength and preventing age-related decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, incorporating grapes into daily nutrition could become a practical and accessible way to support muscle health across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study opens the door for a deeper exploration of how natural foods can positively influence the body at the genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/4/695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4</guid></item><item><title>Cutting Ultra-Processed Foods Leads to Weight Loss and Better Mood - Technology Networks</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQY0VXX1FwRmozZjluVTBCa2RnWEF3YVN2NkY0MTF6UXptMlZISVJSNDhvVVhFaTlJLWZJZUc3eHlOT055NTM0QTBrR254b2xyd0hKaHdBSXNZek5iYjgtYmZ3VnJUcVlfSUdpVVRRaDRGeko4VHBfZkRNc0FYejN3c3FDdjNONjBKZnNHOFE0SlB2bDJTZTkzM3E1bGpQU1NRRmhYYlYtSzdhYmlsR1FrT2VGem5xNUoybGhadThSMG52Z0E1cWlNYTdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_content_body_text" id="inner_content_body_text" data-content-id="396430"&gt;

In an 8-week trial, participants &lt;span data-start="1127" data-end="1157"&gt;cut UPF consumption by 50%&lt;/span&gt;, lost an average of &lt;span data-start="1178" data-end="1192"&gt;7.7 pounds&lt;/span&gt; and improved &lt;span data-start="1207" data-end="1233"&gt;mood and energy levels&lt;/span&gt;, showing potential for broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-start="1278" data-end="1302"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1282" data-end="1300"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-start="1303" data-end="1530"&gt;&lt;li data-start="1303" data-end="1368"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1305" data-end="1366"&gt;Participants reduced UPF intake by nearly 50% in 8 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start="1369" data-end="1450"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1371" data-end="1448"&gt;Weight loss, lower sugar, sodium and saturated fat intake were observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start="1451" data-end="1530"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;Mindfulness and household food environment played key roles in success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dietary programs are designed to help people achieve weight loss or adhere to U.S. nutrition guidelines, which currently make no mention of ultra-processed foods (UPFs). UPFs – like chips or candy – are the mass-produced, packaged products that contain little or no naturally occurring foods. Eating UPFs is &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078476" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated with increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of diseases and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because almost no existing programs focus specifically on reducing UPF intake, researchers from Drexel University’s &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/" target="_blank"&gt;College of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; designed an intervention that included a variety of tactics to target the uniquely problematic aspects of UPFs, including being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/well/eat/food-addiction-fat.html" target="_blank"&gt;engineered to be addictive&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing education about UPFs, the program integrated mindfulness and acceptance-based strategies, to help participants cope with cravings; one-on-one meal planning; a focus on improving the home food environment by involving a household member in the intervention; and financial support to help participants purchase healthy foods,&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/27/healthy-foods-are-often-more-expensive-heres-why.html" target="_blank"&gt; such as fresh fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; which can be more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obesity and Science Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers tested a two-month intervention with 14 adults with overweight or obesity, who regularly ate UPFs (two UPF items per day). On average, participants successfully reduced their UPF intake by almost half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendors"&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendorInner"&gt;&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want more breaking news?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to &lt;i&gt;Technology Networks&lt;/i&gt;’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news" target="_blank" class="btn"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subscribe for FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing UPF intake can be extremely difficult, because the food industry wants us to be hooked on UPFs,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/psychology-well/faculty-core/hagerman-charlotte/" target="_blank"&gt;Charlotte Hagerman, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant research professor in the College. “The industry designs UPFs to be ultra-delicious, convenient, cheap, and constantly present in the U.S. — even if not directly in front of us, then on our TVs, phones, and roadside signs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagerman noted that although the sample was small, the results of this intervention were very promising. By the end of the program, participants had reduced their UPF intake by almost half – both when measured as calories from UPFs and as the total number of UPFs consumed. Participants also reduced their calorie intake, on average by over 600 calories per day. Further, sugar consumption declined by 50%, saturated fat consumption declined by 37%, and sodium consumption declined by 28%. Participants also self-reported losing an average of 7.7 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, participants did not have meaningful increases in their fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that if we want to improve dietary intake more wholistically, we may need to more strongly encourage people to eat these foods,” said Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team highlighted that participants had highly positive feedback about the intervention and were enthusiastic about the benefits they noticed. During interviews, many reported that they experienced improvements in their mood and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the two-month intervention, the 14 participants worked with coaches with expertise in health behavior change at weekly group sessions that included one-on-one meetings, discussion and activities. Participants received education about identifying UPFs and their harmful effects, learned acceptance-based strategies for coping with the cravings and withdrawal of reducing UPFs and learned the importance of the household food environment for reducing UPF intake. Participants also had individual meal-planning sessions and financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess their dietary intake, participants completed the &lt;a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/" target="_blank"&gt;Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool&lt;/a&gt; (ASA-24) to ask participants to report everything they ate over the past 24 hours. Before and after the intervention, participants reported everything they ate during two weekdays and one weekend day (since eating behavior tends to be different during the weekend). The assessment tool automatically reported servings of specific food groups (e.g., fruits), macronutrient intake, and calorie intake, to help the team and participants identify consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the research team categorized each entry as UPF or not and consulted with a UPF expert for a second opinion on ambiguous cases. Researchers were not aware of whether each entry was from before or after the intervention, to avoid biasing their coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data allowed the team to determine whether participants had significant changes in their UPF intake, sodium, added sugar, saturated fat, weight, and fruit/vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that people can reduce their ultra-processed food intake, if given the proper tools, and that they will be enthusiastic about interventions designed for this purpose,” said Hagerman. “The results also suggest that reducing UPF intake will lead to meaningful health improvements – such as weight loss and better mood – in as short as eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to continue testing the intervention – on a larger sample, testing efficacy of the specific components of the intervention and testing on different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference: &lt;/b&gt;Hagerman CJ, Hong AE, Jennings E, Butryn ML.

It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine. It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill.

&lt;p&gt;Some private schools have shut down because of a rapidly escalating measles outbreak in West Texas. Local health departments are overstretched, pausing other important work as they race to limit the spread of this highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;emerged three weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas health department has confirmed 90 cases with 16 hospitalizations, as of Feb. 21. Most of those infected are under age 18. Officials suspect that nine additional measles cases reported in New Mexico, across the border from the epicenter of the Texas outbreak in Gaines, are linked to the Texas outbreak. Ongoing investigations seek to confirm that connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials worry they’re missing cases. Undetected infections bode poorly for communities because doctors and health officials can’t contain transmission if they can’t identify who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;The Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, a nonprofit that advocates for vaccine access. “I think this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of parents may not be taking sick children to clinics where they could be tested, said Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas. “If your kids are responding to fever reducers and you’re keeping hydrated, some people may keep them at home,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated people will contract measles if they’re exposed to the airborne virus, which can linger for up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/transmission.html"&gt;two hours&lt;/a&gt; indoors. Those infected can spread the disease before they have symptoms. Around &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;1 in 5 people&lt;/a&gt; with measles end up hospitalized, 1 in 10 children develop ear infections that can lead to permanent hearing loss, and about 1 in 1,000 children die from respiratory and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaines has a large Mennonite population, which often shuns vaccinations. “We respect everyone’s right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,” said Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District, in the heart of the county, in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/at-the-epicenter-of-the-west-texas-measles-outbreak-one-hospital-in-gaines-county-works-towards-containment/"&gt;Texas Standard&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s just what it means to be an American, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health officials have been trying to persuade the parents of unvaccinated children to protect their kids by bringing them to pop-up clinics offering measles vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some people who were on the fence, who thought measles wasn’t something their kids would see, are recalculating and coming forward for vaccination,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments are also operating mobile testing units outside schools in an attempt to detect infections before they spread. They’re staffing clinics that can provide treatment prophylactically for infants exposed to the virus, who are too young for vaccination. Local health officials are advising day care centers on how to protect young children and babies, and educating school nurses on how to spot signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am putting 75% of my staff on this outbreak,” Wells said. Although Lubbock isn’t at the center of the outbreak, people infected have sought treatment there. “If someone infected was in the [emergency room], we need to identify everyone who was in that ER within two hours of that visit, notify them, and find out if they were vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in rural areas are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7427223/"&gt;notoriously underfunded&lt;/a&gt;. Wells said the workload has meant pressing pause on other programs, such as one providing substance abuse education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines, said health officials were following CDC guidelines, as of last year, by advising schools to keep unvaccinated children home for 21 days if they shared a classroom or the cafeteria with someone infected. This means that many parents may need to stay home from work to care for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of private schools have closed down because of a high number of sick children,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The burden of measles outbreaks multiplies as the disease spreads. Curbing a 2018 outbreak in Washington state with 72 cases &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/4/e2020027037/180774/Societal-Costs-of-a-Measles-Outbreak?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;cost about $2.3 million&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to $76,000 in medical costs, and an estimated $1 million in economic losses due to illness, quarantines, and caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers expect such outbreaks to become larger and more common because of scores of laws around the U.S. — pending and recently passed — that ultimately lower vaccine rates by allowing parents to exempt their children from vaccine requirements at public schools and some private schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such policies are coupled with misinformation about childhood vaccination now platformed at the highest levels of government. The new director of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has erroneously blamed vaccines for autism, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0310-248b"&gt;discredited theories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015515"&gt;shown to be untrue&lt;/a&gt; by more than a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS postponed an important meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, without saying when it would resume. In addition, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240408191802/https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/toolkit/state-health-departments.html"&gt;letter template to school principals&lt;/a&gt;, advising unvaccinated children to remain home from school for 21 days if they’ve been exposed to the measles virus, is no longer on the agency’s website. An old version remains &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/150924"&gt;posted on its archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a rule, at least 95% of people need to be vaccinated against measles for a community to be well protected. That threshold is high enough to protect infants too young for the vaccine, people who can’t take the vaccine for medical reasons, and anyone who doesn’t mount a strong, lasting immune response to it. Last school year, the number of kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm#T1_down"&gt;exempted from a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; requirement was higher than ever reported before, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Gaines, exemptions were far higher than the national average, approaching 20% in 2023-24. Gaines has one of the lowest rates of childhood vaccination in Texas. At a local public school district in the community of Loop, only 46% of kindergarten students have gotten vaccines that protect against measles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid an outbreak that displays the toll of measles in under-vaccinated pockets of America, Texas lawmakers have filed about 25 bills in this year’s legislative session that could limit vaccination further. Lakshaman said the public — the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/"&gt;majority of whom believe in the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of measles vaccination — should contact their representatives about the danger of such decisions. &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/get-involved/"&gt;Her group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safecommunitiescoalition.org/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; offer resources to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got children winding up in the hospital, and yet lawmakers who’ve got their blinders on,” she said, referring to pending policies that will erode vaccination rates. “It’s just mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With extensive safety precautions, he hasn't lost any birds to the virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But the outbreak forced him to make tough calls, like deciding whether to accept a new batch of baby chicks from a hatchery near a virus hotspot in Pennsylvania. If he didn't, he would have no chickens to replace those that die or get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I had no choice," Kreher told the BBC.

The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly," said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Trump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;When asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had "crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty", inflation and "radical environmental policies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;Red flags as a virus mutates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Scientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Influenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Then, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu "is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes", he said. "We need new strategies to fight this virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;A new Trump strategy for farmers in crisis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;California poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was extremely painful," said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus "with biosecurity and medication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week," Hassett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked," he said. "We're in a crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Still, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;At the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis. But, she said, the threat is one Trump officials should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We don't know if this could be an emergency for humans next week, or if it could be several months from now, or if it might not happen at all," Ms Simoneau said. "But taking your eye off the ball isn't really an option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While genetics play a role in who develops myopia, other factors that increase risk include &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/06/children-urged-play-outdoors-cut-risk-shortsightedness" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not spending enough time outdoors&lt;/a&gt; and focusing on things that are close up for prolonged periods, which could explain why screen time has been &lt;a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/news/screen-time-linked-to-risk-of-myopia-in-young-people" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;associated with a higher risk and severity of myopia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Now, researchers in Korea say they have shed fresh light on this relationship in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830598" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an analysis of 45 studies&lt;/a&gt;, involving 335,524 participants, that looked at the use of digital screen devices such as mobile phones, game consoles and television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The results, largely based on data from children, adolescents and young adults, reveal that an additional hour of daily screen time is, on average, associated with 21% higher odds of having myopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Chris Hammond of King’s College London, a consultant ophthalmologist who was not involved in the work, said that based on a prevalence of myopia of about 15% in children aged 12 to 13 in the UK, the research suggested a child’s risk of being shortsighted rose to 18% if they used a screen for an hour, and 27% after four hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Korean team added that, for those who already had the condition, an additional hour of daily screen time was associated with 54% higher odds of becoming even more shortsighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When the researchers delved deeper they found the risk of myopia rose steeply as daily screen time increased, with 5% greater odds of myopia for one hour a day of exposure compared with no screen use, and 97% higher odds for four hours’ use a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Beyond that duration, the researchers added, the odds rose more slowly, while there was no clear association with myopia for screen use below one hour a day, suggesting a potential “safety threshold”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a4614703-6130-4264-bcc3-8ee29c8747fa" data-spacefinder-role="richLink"

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the research has limitations, including that some studies relied on self-reports of myopia, the team did not look at how often participants carried out other closeup activities, measuring screen time is difficult, and further evidence is needed to support the idea of a safety threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition, the research could not prove screen time caused myopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“For instance, because screen use predominantly occurs indoors, the resulting reduction in exposure to the protective benefits of outdoor environments may contribute to the increased risk of myopia,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Hammond agreed, noting the interaction of risk factors in the development of myopia is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But, he said: “This meta-analysis, on top of studies of the ‘natural experiment’ of the Covid lockdowns, strongly suggests that a combination of young children being kept indoors and spending significant time on screens is not good for their eyes and the combination results in myopia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Rupert Bourne of Anglia Ruskin University, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon, welcomed the study, noting a key concern was that worsening myopia raised the risk of sight-threatening conditions.“These findings can inform educational strategies and public health policies aimed at addressing the myopia pandemic,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bird flu does not spread human-to-human yet, but that could change rapidly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that variants of H5N1 have been around since the 1990s and it has yet to evolve into a strain that could cause a human pandemic. That’s because of how the virus is currently spreading, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="no reports" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;no reports&lt;/a&gt; of sustained human-to-human transmission associated with the current avian influenza strains circulating in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of cases have been in farm workers. Schaffner said unless you work closely with dairy cattle or with poultry like chickens, your risk of catching bird flu right at this moment is “essentially zero.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Russo, chief of the infectious disease division at the University at Buffalo, said there is not “grounds for panic” yet for a human pandemic because of the virus’ current inefficiencies. He noted that the bird flu infections in humans have occurred primarily in individuals that have had close contact with poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 “does not efficiently infect humans, you need a more prolonged contact, probably a much higher dose,” he said. “And equally importantly, if not more importantly, those individuals that get infected, it doesn’t transmit well from human to human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“This virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Suresh Kuchipudi, veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this does not mean the threat of a bird flu pandemic could not happen in the near future. “It may never be able to do it, but we don’t want to rule out that possibility,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the avian influenza virus’ ability to infect so many different mammals ― including us ― is worrisome. Because the virus is now infecting multiple hosts simultaneously and continuously, “this virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each time it gets into a new host, that could accelerate the changes in the virus for adaptation,” Kuchipudi continued. “The more frequently that happens, the chances of the virus ... learning the skill of infecting that host becomes higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained human-to-human transmission could just take the virus “one or two” mutations and “could happen anytime,” Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one worst-case scenario, an animal like a pig could be infected both with bird flu and with human flu, and learn how to spread the virus better in what is known as “recombination,” Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on top of the virus’ uncertain evolution, the federal public health infrastructure that is necessary for fighting against pandemics is also facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="announced" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, which coordinates global responses to pandemics.

But if you want to know some ways to minimize the virus, there are a few lifestyle changes to consider if they’re relevant to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a cat owner, bring your pet inside. Cats enjoy chasing and eating birds, and are highly vulnerable to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuchipudi co-authored a December &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#d1e337" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#d1e337" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on 10 outdoor domestic cats who died of H5N1 in South Dakota and had bird feathers found near them, indicating that the cats ate the virus-infected birds.

But feel free to keep drinking pasteurized milk. By heating milk to a specific temperature over time, pasteurized milk kills potential viruses like H5N1 and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle#Status" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="continues to be safe to drink" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle#Status" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;continues to be safe to drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when in doubt about your bird flu exposure, it helps to fall back on simple hygiene practices. It is believed that dairy workers got the H5N1 virus through infected milk splatters and “touching infected milking equipment and then rubbing their eyes,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, personal protective equipment, such as high-quality, well-fitting masks, eye protection and gloves should be used when in contact with animals known to carry the virus. For example, if you feed wild birds, use gloves, and if you see a dead bird, be cautious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

                  &lt;p&gt;Eleven children who were legally blind at birth &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/21/3030330/0/en/MeiraGTx-Announces-The-Lancet-Publication-of-Data-Demonstrating-the-Efficacy-of-rAAV8-hRKp-AIPL1-for-the-Treatment-of-Leber-Congenital-Amaurosis-4-LCA4-Retinal-Dystrophy.html" target="_blank"&gt;all gained visual acuity &lt;/a&gt;after receiving MeiraGTx's investigational gene therapy, data that is prompting the biotech to seek accelerated approval in AIPL1-associated severe retinal dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from four of the 11 children were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02812-5/fulltext"&gt;published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 21.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Visual acuity—measured with a child-friendly, game-like touchscreen test—in treated eyes improved after four or more weeks, while the acuity in untreated eyes became unmeasurable, according to the published results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of treatment “extended outside the meaningful effects on vision and result in life-changing benefits in all areas of development including communication, behavior, schooling, mood, psychological benefits and social integration,” MeiraGTx's CEO Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., said in the biotech's accompanying release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="t1-ad-slot" data-ad-slot-id="38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One child developed cystoid macular edema, a build-up of fluid, in their treated eye due to the therapy, researchers wrote in the article, which partially improved over time and didn’t prevent the child’s vision from improving. There were no other safety concerns, the scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Evercore ISI analysts described the findings as “strong clinical data with clear evidence of efficacy in a huge unmet need pediatric population.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As should be expected from a subretinal approach, safety was clean,” the analysts added in a Feb. 21 note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After positive conversations with the U.K.’s medicines watchdog, the firm now plans to submit the gene therapy, called rAAV8.hRKp.AIPL1, for expedited approval in that country, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MeiraGTx, which is headquartered in New York and has R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing in England, has also been in discussions with the FDA on how to pursue accelerated approval in the U.S., the company added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy uses an adeno-associated virus to deliver functional copies of the AIPL1 gene and is injected once directly into the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study began with four children between the ages of one and three who were born with severe retinal dystrophy associated with mutated copies of the AIPL1 gene. These children were each treated in one eye. After the researchers saw the treatment was safe and seemed to be working, they gave the gene therapy in both eyes of a further seven children.&lt;/p&gt;

"Ultra-processed food is driving the obesity epidemic. When we get President Trump back in the White House and me to Washington, we're going to fix our broken food system and Make America Healthy Again,” he said in an earlier X post. He has also pledged to remove ultra-processed foods from school lunches due to their potential link to cancer in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are typically high in unhealthy fats, refined sugars, sodium, and artificial additives, and often lack essential nutrients and fiber, making them detrimental to overall health. are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, diabetes, obesity, sleep problems, and even premature death, according to multiple researchers. Long-term studies suggest that diets high in processed foods increase the risk of chronic illnesses and reduce life expectancy. So, it's certain that they have to go from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the MAHA movement is leading efforts to reform the nation’s food system, here are some changes you can make in your homes. Here is a list of the worst foods you buy from the supermarket. You can swap them with some better choices instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of common &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/ultra-processed-foods-linked-with-buck-teeth-in-children-says-study/articleshow/117211464.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; you will easily find in the grocery store or supermarket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweetened sodas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are loaded with sugar and artificial sweeteners, which significantly contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Though artificial sweeteners may seem like a healthier option, studies suggest they alter gut bacteria, increase cravings for sweet foods, and may even contribute to weight gain. Some research also links artificial sweeteners to an increased risk of metabolic disorders and digestive issues. Excessive consumption can also lead to dental issues and increased cravings for unhealthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Processed meats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats contain nitrates, preservatives, and high sodium levels, which are linked to an increased risk of cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kids’ breakfast foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the breakfast products like toaster patisserie, and sweetened cereals marketed as ‘healthy’ are actually high in sugar and artificial flavorings, leading to insulin resistance and weight gain over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Instant meals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though instant noodles and other ready-to-eat and make meals are convenient, they contain unhealthy preservatives, excessive sodium, and refined carbohydrates, which are linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Processed foods typically contain unhealthy preservatives such as tertiary-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), which can have adverse health effects when consumed regularly. They are also loaded with excessive sodium, which can contribute to water retention, increased blood pressure, and a higher risk of hypertension. The presence of refined carbohydrates, which are stripped of essential nutrients and fiber, can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, increasing the likelihood of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Packaged snack cakes and pastries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercially produced bakery goods are highly processed and packed with refined flour, trans fats, and artificial additives.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden's Viking Age population appears to have suffered from severe oral and maxillofacial disease, sinus and ear infections, osteoarthritis, and much more. This is shown in a study from the University of Gothenburg in which Viking skulls were examined using modern X-ray techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, researchers published a report based on the examination of a large number of teeth from the Viking Age population of Varnhem in the Swedish province of Västergötland. Varnhem is known for its thousands of ancient graves and excavations of well-preserved skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, odontologists at the University of Gothenburg have taken this research further, looking at not only teeth but also entire skulls, by using modern computed tomography, also known as CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detailed image analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, presented in &lt;i&gt;BDJ Open&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the 15 individuals whose skulls were examined suffered from a broad range of diseases. The CT scans show pathological bone growths in the cranium and jawbone, revealing infections and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals showed signs of having suffered from sinus or ear infections that left traces in the adjacent bone structures. Signs of osteoarthritis and various dental diseases were also found. All the skulls came from adults who died between 20 and 60 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study lead, Carolina Bertilsson, is an assistant researcher at the University of Gothenburg and a dentist within Sweden's Public Dental Service. The study was performed with specialists in dental radiology at the University of Gothenburg and an archaeologist from Västergötlands museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they conducted the examinations and analyzed the images. CT scans provide &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/three-dimensional+images/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;three-dimensional images&lt;/a&gt; that enable researchers to study in detail the various types of skeletal damage, layer by layer, in the different parts of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/skull/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Greater understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results of the study provide a greater understanding of these people's health and well-being. Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn't have the medical and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental care&lt;/a&gt; we do, or the kind of pain relief—and antibiotics—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is described as a pilot study. One important aspect was to test CT as a method for future and more extensive studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costco seems to have everything a homeowner could possibly need. Whether you're on the hunt for &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1764984/costco-affordable-dinnerware-kitchenware/" target="_blank"&gt;affordable dinnerware and kitchenware&lt;/a&gt; or shopping for bulk inexpensive food items your household always plows right through, the Costco warehouse is always filled to the brim with opportunity. And, this newest viral product is further proof that the supermarket has the answer to every home issue; Costco's &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/thomasville-dillard-accent-chair-with-storage-ottoman.product.4000180371.html" target="_blank"&gt;Thomasville Dillard accent chair with storage ottoman&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable, cozy piece of furniture that will add storage and style to any room.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accent chair has over 600 five-star reviews on Costco's site, with users lauding its comfort, affordability, and storage. "This chair makes my living room look cozy and very classy," one Costco buyer wrote, adding that it's "very comfortable, and the extra storage space is a plus." Another reviewer chimed in: "I love that it has springs and not just foam. It's nice to curl up in and watch TV or read." Some shoppers warned that the chair is heavier than they expected, but Costco will typically assist shoppers with delivery and setup: "They delivered and set up free which was helpful to me as I'm a senior," one reviewer wrote. It retails for $599.99 but is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1770010/what-is-costco-direct-how-to-use-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;Costco Direct program, which you can use to your advantage&lt;/a&gt; and save money on this purchase if you bundle it with other items. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;How to style the Thomasville Dillard accent chair&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few gripes that Costco buyers had about this chair was its lack of color options. The light grey coloring can feel limiting, and it's also hard to fully get an idea of the color with just online photos. One reviewer described it as "a mix of grey and white, more on the warm side but not super warm toned." Another shopper called the chair "a very light grey that ... can match any style." With this input, it's safe to assume that the chair will fit in well with any gray tones, and will especially &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1740641/best-wall-paint-colors-complement-gray-floors/" target="_blank"&gt;complement gray floors&lt;/a&gt;. Try painting a matching accent wall, then get bookshelves to complete your reading nook, and fill them up with colorful books behind the chair. This is how Instagram creator That's My Bookshelf styled the piece in her home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if your space is more about earth tones, you can treat this chair as you would any white piece of furniture. Consider swapping the three gray pillows for your own colorful throw pillows that match other components of your living room, or placing a vibrant throw blanket on the arm to give it a pop of color. If the chair seems to be taking up too much space in your living room, you can move the ottoman to another place in your house, as it easily doubles as a storage bench that would be perfect in kids' playrooms or at the foot of a bed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of California, Los Angeles researchers have discovered that chronic stress flips brain activity between two amygdala-striatal pathways, disrupting flexible decision-making and promoting inflexible habits.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research identifies distinct roles for the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/basolateral+amygdala/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;basolateral amygdala&lt;/a&gt;–dorsomedial striatum (BLA→DMS) and central amygdala–dorsomedial striatum (CeA→DMS) circuits in action-outcome learning and habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress impairs goal-directed decision-making, often leading to rigid, habitual behaviors that underpin several psychiatric conditions. Understanding the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuronal+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuronal circuits&lt;/a&gt; involved could illuminate vulnerabilities in disorders like substance use, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive-compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "A dual-pathway architecture for stress to disrupt agency and promote habit," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08580-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used a systems neuroscience approach in male and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/female+mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;female mice&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the underlying &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic mild unpredictable stress was induced through pseudo-random unexpected exposure to stressors, including damp bedding, cage tilting, white noise, continuous illumination, physical restraint, and footshock over 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the intentionally mild stress level did not produce pronounced anxiety or depression-like phenotypes in classic tests, blood corticosterone levels were elevated, and body weight decreased in stressed mice compared to controls, confirming stress induction. Controls received handling only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohorts underwent short training sessions in which lever presses earned food pellets. Fiber photometry recorded neuronal signals in distinct amygdala–striatal projections. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations pinpointed how these circuits control goal-directed learning or habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral assessments involved lever-press tasks under random-ratio and random-interval reinforcement schedules. Outcome-specific devaluation and contingency degradation tests measured action-outcome learning and habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control mice reduced lever pressing when the reward was devalued, indicating preserved agency. Stressed mice displayed insensitivity to devaluation, indicating disrupted action-outcome learning and premature habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity in BLA→DMS and CeA→DMS pathways were recorded using fiber photometry. BLA→DMS projections were activated by rewards during learning in control mice but suppressed in stressed mice, disrupting action-outcome associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, CeA→DMS projections, typically inactive during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early learning&lt;/a&gt;, became progressively engaged following stress, facilitating habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations further clarified these pathways' functions. Inhibiting BLA→DMS activity during learning in unstressed mice disrupted agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating BLA→DMS projections during learning restored agency in stressed mice. In contrast, inhibiting CeA→DMS projections during learning prevented stress-induced habits, while activating this pathway in mildly stressed mice promoted habit formation. Neither manipulation affected instrumental learning acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; diminishes BLA→DMS-mediated flexible decision-making and recruits CeA→DMS circuitry to promote inflexible habits. These results highlight the amygdala's dual influence on the dorsomedial striatum in balancing goal-directed and habitual behaviors under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also suggests that stress-induced vulnerabilities to compulsive behaviors, including those linked to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use&lt;/a&gt; and other psychiatric conditions, might have targetable brain circuitry for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS - both in May 2014 -and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merbecoviruses have been detected in minks and pangolins - the animal believed to be the intermediary for Covid between bats and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, the scientists wrote, 'suggests frequent cross-species transmission of these viruses between bats and other animal species.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'This study reveals a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoVs in bats that efficiently use human [cells] and underscores their potential zoonotic risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV viruses were first detected in bats in 2006, but the new data suggests HKU5-CoV-2 has a 'higher potential for interspecies infection' than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the potential for HKU5-CoV-2 to spill over to humans 'remains to be investigated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was conducted by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wuhan/index.html" id="mol-21275be0-f067-11ef-983a-d59410a7a5f9"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; Institute of Virology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WIV is at the center of the lab-leak theory, which claims &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13220019/probe-covid-origins-lab-leak.html"&gt;Covid-19 was manufactured in a Chinese lab&lt;/a&gt; and accidentally leaked to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest study states a zoonotic spillover is believed to be responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic as bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while SARS and MERS have documented evidence of transmission between animals to humans, the 'intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study claiming to support the Covid-19 zoonotic theory is a 2023 report published &lt;span&gt;in the journal Nature and led by virus expert Ralph Baric of the University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;North Carolina. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It found the strain of coronavirus harbored in pangolins, endangered animals in China that are sometimes consumed by humans, was nearly identical to the Covid-19 virus that caused the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has led some scientists to theorize the first cases of Covid-19 likely jumped from the animals to immunocompromised humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This gave the novel virus ample opportunity to mutate and replicate until it reached its full pandemic potential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, another camp of scientists insist the pandemic was sparked by a lab leak. This theory, subscribed to by some US federal agencies, posits Covid-19 was manufactured in a lab and accidentally escaped, which set off the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a 2018 research proposal, which was ultimately denied funding and did not go forward, saw scientists seeking to create a novel virus that had four characteristics matching features of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study claiming to support this theory was conducted in 2024 by researchers from Australia and Arizona.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They used a risk analysis tool - which they described as the most comprehensive yet - to determine the chances the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of 'unnatural' or 'natural' origin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team compared the characteristics of the virus and the pandemic to 11 criteria that analyzed things like the rarity of a virus, the timing of a pandemic, the population infected, the spread of a virus and the unexpected symptoms of a virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the nature of Covid, researchers assigned a score to each category - less than 50 percent meant the pandemic would be classified as a natural outbreak, but 50 or more percent would mean the pandemic was an unnatural outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid received a score of 68 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:23:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPYjNTT0JYWXAtQlZpYi05cXhBU01rd3Rwc182b2tpVWM1b0cySy1vU21iRFZWdFpvTGNFX2NDZl94OThqY2xQdS1Wb2p5dUxiak81TnZSelFteEk3UHBWMFoxZ0tmT0VUcG5JQ3IzMXNvTms2Ni1jNDk0YzI5LWRSYzd6clVpX21IU3J6akhTZkwzREs5RkZpQTc3bUNTNS1oTmRtRkJPSWN1emhXOXF30gG0AUFVX3lxTE1adTZ4anNnNVBXekluRlNsMjBta1h4V2pjc05KWWpfc2RWaWNsSGtEVVBiT2JNZzBzWkVVTkpYcjNiNTQ5TmJxbjJOLUdtcGczYVIwVWRNWWlES2ZzdVg0ZEt1YlVDV1MzT3RTTGxXLXd2NTJQT0xvZ0N6dDB4d2tRMW43SWlJSkdlbHc4R1VDdFpPdGUyVFVBeFg4R050eUp4SWROMXVqdTZMQjU2VkI1UmthVg</guid></item><item><title>Woman's Unwelcome Souvenir From Trip: a Brain Worm - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOd01ZX0VqdElnTkhISy1Dd2ZlQ2dXT1FWZFZLZVpQb1U2MnNVaEt4UEUyODZIUDNwM3h5ZW1RUVE1RUNObGJDNnJwSmdhN2Nmd1JObk5mSXJpODY0Q1I3SWhPVjFkNEdpNVh2LVJPcFo0X1FrRU9ZOFc1VzZZUTVFOG4wOGNvU2tXZ2V3RVVCNWdnN3ZSTmFHRmVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A woman on a whirlwind three-week junket to Hawaii, Japan, and Thailand returned home with an unwanted memento: a parasite that embedded itself in her brain and made her legs feel like they were burning. That odd sensation started out in the New England 30-year-old's feet after she got back from her travels, per a case study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Concerning spread: &lt;/strong&gt;Soon, that sensation had spread to the woman's legs, which had become very sensitive, and she began feeling run-down, though she thought that fatigue was just jet lag. The woman went to the ER, but tests found nothing amiss and she was sent home. She ended up back in the ER days later after the sensations she was having spread to her trunk and arms and she started experiencing headaches. Once again, tests found nothing wrong and she was sent home—but she was soon brought back by her partner after she started experiencing confusion.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

Measles is caused by the morvillivirus, which can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. "If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-does-measles-spread"&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks.

However, that can change as we age because we're at an increased risk for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt;, partly because our bodies can no longer effectively absorb certain nutrients. So if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging. Just be sure to talk to your doctor first before adjusting your diet or trying new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said an unprocessed diet has about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet has less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;400 to 420 mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320 mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;body cannot absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City, who is also part of CNET's medical review board, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000 mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200 mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" target="_self"&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to take 1,200 mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin because you typically absorb it through the skin just by being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/a&gt;, making it an important nutrient for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/supplements-white-house-advisor-fauci-takes-every-day-to-help-keep-his-immune-system-healthy.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Fauci noted that he took vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID pandemic) and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/multivitamins-memory-and-aging-everything-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Cleveland Clinic points out, your body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;isn't able to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/reap-the-benefits-of-omega-3s-with-these-heart-healthy-foods/" target="_self"&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; or supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily."

The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-is-key-for-healthy-aging-heres-how-to-start/" target="_self"&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/a&gt; and other good habits, getting the right minerals and vitamins may improve your health.

I also use the lowest possible dose to get symptom relief.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes just few weeks before the UK enters hay fever season - which starts from late March and lasts until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately one in four Brits— about 16million people — suffer from hay fever and many turn to antihistamines tablets and sprays for relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Komaroff said the theoretical risk posed by antihistamines was linked to how they work to stop allergies from causing symptoms like sneezing, coughing and itchy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some studies suggest antihistamines, commonly taken for hay fever, are linked to increased dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained the drugs are known as anticholinergics - which means they interfere with the brain's release of a vital chemical called acetylcholine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this effectively limits allergic symptoms, low levels of the substance are linked dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Komaroff said: 'Theoretically, these drugs might increase the risk of dementia by blocking a particular brain neurotransmitter [brain chemical] or increasing brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said it was key to remember the science of this theory isn't yet settled.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the past decade, several studies have suggested that these pills might increase the risk of dementia, while other studies have found no risk. And all the studies are inherently flawed,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies that have found a link between the drugs and dementia include one&lt;span&gt; 2015 paper that tracked the brain health of more than 3,400 participants over 65 years old between 1994 and 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found there was a link between increased doses of anticholinergics and those that developed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00541-5/abstract"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology also revealed a link between antihistamines and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/taiwan/index.html" id="mol-dff550d0-abf8-11ef-8cf0-fd8669ca5088"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;’s National Health Insurance Research Database from 2011 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It included more than 700,000 patients with recent-onset allergic hay fever. They were split into groups — those that didn't take antihistamines and those that did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After making adjustments for preexisting medical conditions, the researchers found there was a dose-dependent increase in dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hay fever drugs aren't the only anticholinergic medications commonly taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other examples include some sleep medications, those treating urinary incontinence, nausea, muscle tension and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, a British study on more than a million people found taking anticholinergics was linked to an 18 per cent increased risk of dementia diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men were slightly more vulnerable — their increased risk was 22 per cent, compared to women at 16 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia has a variety of causes, two of the most common being Alzheimer's disease and a reduced blood flow to the brain following a stroke, known as vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer.

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the American South was crawling with intestinal hookworms. Some initial surveys in the 1930s suggested nearly 54 percent of the population was infected, with prevalence in some areas as high as 76 percent. Through concerted deworming efforts and improved hygiene, the worms were largely flushed out over the subsequent decades. But as one medical editorial put it in 2017: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817787/"&gt;We still got 'em&lt;/a&gt;. That year, a study detected genetic traces of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/97/5/article-p1623.xml?tab_body=fulltext"&gt;N. americanus in the stool of more than a third of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tested in an impoverished community in Lowndes County, Alabama. In Lowndes, approximately 50 percent of households have failing or no sewage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creeping eruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's something you can enjoy thinking about before bed tonight, let's not forget that there's a second category of hookworms: the ones that bore into your body &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/zoonotichookworm/index.html"&gt;but generally don't make it into your intestines&lt;/a&gt;. This may seem like the better scenario than the intestinal group. But, that's only the case if you're ok with hookworm larvae wandering aimlessly through the layers of your skin, leaving an intensely itchy, serpentine rash, marked by redness and little pus-filled blisters in their wake. The rash is called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), or "creeping eruption."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second type of invasion is borne from worm-infested animals. The pack of parasites that cause CLM in people include hookworms that infect dogs and cats (&lt;em&gt;Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncinaria stenocephala&lt;/em&gt;), and in rarer cases cattle (&lt;em&gt;Bunostomum phlebotomum&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In animals, these hookworms live out a life cycle much like the intestinal cycle described earlier, with the parasites making themselves at home in the animals' small intestines. But, in humans, the worms find a dead-end. Most never make it out of the skin, roaming randomly until their death, which, without treatment, can take about five to six weeks. In their desperate meandering, some larvae—which measure 500 to 600 micrometers (0.05 to 0.06 centimeters) long—will travel several centimeters each day. Others can make it into deeper tissue, but become stuck. On occasion, &lt;em&gt;A. caninum&lt;/em&gt;—which normally infect dogs—have been known to make it to the intestines and partially develop. But they never complete their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breast cancer: Even “a little” might be too much&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/breast-cancer-disparities.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

Within that massive number is another: About 16 percent, or more than 44,000 cases of breast cancer, &lt;a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" title="breast cancer and alcohol" rel="noreferrer" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" target="_blank"&gt;are attributed to alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2024 research review published in the American Cancer Society’s flagship journal &lt;i&gt;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Research consistently finds that alcohol can alter or raise hormone levels, including estrogen. Higher levels of the hormone can lead to mutations in breast tissue that cause cancer. “Even drinking within the guidelines, so one a day for women,” can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, LoConte says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Put another way, research finds about 11 out of every 100 women who consume less than one alcoholic beverage will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, as noted in the Surgeon General’s advisory. Two more than that, or 13 in every 100 women, who have one drink a day, and 15 in 100 women who have two drinks per day, will develop breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Of course, drinking is but one prominent risk factor that could raise a woman’s risk of developing cancer. Many others, starting with age, obesity, genetics/family history and environmental exposures (to radiation, for example), can also stack the deck against a person. Doctors encourage &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/mammogram-guidelines-breast-cancer-screening.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="breast cnacer screenings"&gt;considering all risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“If you’re a postmenopausal woman and there is a reason why your risk is higher than normal for breast cancer,” it’s important to factor that in when choosing whether to drink — and how much to drink, says William Dahut, M.D., chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouth, throat and esophageal cancers: The “dose-dependent” dangers of drinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Although head and neck cancers aren’t as common as breast cancer, the alcohol-related risk of developing these cancers is more pronounced and increases more sharply the more a person drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;That risk is present even when a person stays within the recommended limit, which is two drinks per day for men (and, again, one drink per day for women), LoConte says. She recommends abiding by those guidelines at a minimum, “but really getting as low as comfortable” is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;LoConte was the lead author of a 2018 statement on &lt;a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" title="alcohol and cancer" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol and cancer&lt;/a&gt; by the American Society of Clinical Oncology that outlined those “dose-dependent” relationships between total alcohol consumption and rates for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Heavy drinkers — which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as men who consume five or more drinks on any day or 15 drinks or more per week, and women who have four or more drinks on any day or eight or more per week — developed oral cavity (mouth) and pharynx (throat) cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at around five times the rate of non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;A predominant cause of these and other alcohol-related cancers (and a contributor to breast cancer) is a byproduct of the body’s breakdown of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA. Once damaged, cells can grow out of control and turn into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/tag/dolores-catania/"&gt;Dolores Catania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is always trying to look better. &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/show/real-housewives-of-new-jersey/"&gt;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; has had &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/2024/11/04/dolores-catania-reveals-recent-cosmetic-procedure-rhonj/"&gt;numerous cosmetic procedures&lt;/a&gt;. She also &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/2024/05/06/dolores-catania-on-ozempic-use-no-shame-in-it-rhonj/"&gt;takes Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, after finding it a better match for her body than Ozempic. As such, the RHONJ star lost a noticeable amount of weight. But after incorporating a fitness overhaul, Dolores may be done with the Type 2 diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with any medication, one has to weigh the benefits and side effects. Dolores also discussed the matter with her doctor. The Bravolebrity shared the advice her care provider gave her, and what she decided to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dolores-catania-continues-to-be-honest-about-her-medication-use"&gt;Dolores Catania continues to be “honest” about her medication use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

News" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsZuHCxELi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolores hailed her Mounjaro experience as a “life-changer” during a recent interview with &lt;a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/811942/rhonj-dolores-catania-gets-real-about-the-menopause-and-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hello! magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Her boyfriend, &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/tag/paul-connell/"&gt;Paul Connell&lt;/a&gt; also got on board and lost 60 pounds. Needless to say, the results were “positive” for both RHONJ stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I kind of think I broke the seal on being honest about it,” Dolores said of her history with the trendy weight loss drug. “With Ozempic, it has been a life-changer for me and my boyfriend, Paul, who lost 60 pounds. He no longer takes a certain blood pressure medication and it’s been really positive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She continued, “I personally like it. I know it’s time for me to wean myself off or go on a lower dose but doctors have said there’s not really anything wrong with staying on it. You must always go through a real doctor, though, who knows what they are doing. Research is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Dolores got the green light to stay on the medication. If she does lower the dose, or go off it completely, it will be her decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a prior interview with &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/11168012/rhonj-dolores-catania-paul-connell-transformation-weight-ozempic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, Dolores went into more detail about how she became more dedicated to her workouts. The reality TV star and Paul hit the gym “three to for times a week.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I hate working out, but it’s starting to feel good to me,” she admitted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; streaming on Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of us prefer walking outdoors in our neighborhood, on our &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/outdoors/best-hiking-trails-with-waterfalls/"&gt;favorite hiking trail&lt;/a&gt; under a canopy of trees, or in our local cities and towns. There are positives to using a treadmill, including using it any time the gym is open, even if the weather outside is less than favorable. You can also control the incline and use the built-in fan on your face when you start working up a sweat. Researchers assessed the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;walking on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; compared to walking outdoors. Let’s look at the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-study" aria-label="The study"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1316798" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1316798" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/man-in-hoodie-on-treadmill.jpeg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1316798 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man on treadmill"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1316798" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Lightfield Studios / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epub/10.1089/eco.2021.0043" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ecopsychology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers compared how walking in a natural outdoor environment and walking in an indoor simulated natural environment affected emotion and measures of perceived exertion. The goal was to understand if exercising outside leads to more significant physical exertion and the resulting emotional responses. They measured heart rate to assess physical exertion in a study involving 74 university students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The participants were split into two groups. Group one walked outdoors on a 0.6 km flat pavement. Group two watched a video of the same outdoor path while walking &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;indoors on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1361259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1361259" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pexels-pexels-latam-man-jogging-brisk-walking-outdoors-in-nature-.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1361259 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man jogging brisk walking outdoors in nature"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1361259" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Latam / Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both groups walked for 15 minutes at their own pace. Researchers used the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale or RPE scale and used heart rate monitors to measure exertion. They assessed the participants’ emotional responses using surveys that involved factors like calmness, tension, energy, and tiredness before and after walking. Participants also recorded weather conditions like temperature, wind, and cloud cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-results" aria-label="The results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1362160" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1362160" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pexels-olly-Man-on-treadmill-with-sleeveless-shirt-in-gym.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1362160 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man on treadmill with sleeveless shirt in gym"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1362160" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Olly / Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outdoor walking increased the heart rate more than &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;walking indoors on the treadmill&lt;/a&gt;. Participants who walked outdoors had a much higher average heart rate, indicating more significant physiological exertion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants’ perceptions of their walks were pretty similar between both the outdoor and indoor walkers, with both rating their exertion as ‘very light’ to ‘light’ using the RPE scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The group that walked outdoors found a much higher increase in their energy levels, whereas indoor walkers reported no change. Indoor walkers did experience a significant reduction in tension, but the outdoor walkers didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were no notable differences between the groups when it comes to calmness, tiredness, positive affect, and negative affect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers stated that their findings align with previous research highlighting that acute bouts of physical activity in a natural environment enhance positive activated effect. The positive activated effect refers to a subjective mental state and feelings of positive energy, engagement, alertness, and enthusiasm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-takeaway" aria-label="The takeaway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1365626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1365626" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/atrack_cos_44037_1_1_2-1.jpg?fit=800%2C564&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1365626 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="man with an orange backpack walking outside"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1365626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;ORTLIEB / ORTLIEB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study showed that walking or exercising outdoors and breathing in the natural fresh air can elevate your heart rate higher compared to walking indoors on a treadmill. Outdoor walking seems to be more energizing, so maybe it’s worth finding a nearby tranquil trail or strolling through your neighborhood. This study also shows that walking outside could lead to greater enjoyment, and if you enjoy something more, you’re&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28436287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; more likely&lt;/a&gt; to do it, setting us up for future fitness success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“We all get exactly the same virus but it’s the amount of protective layer and amount of reserve that you’ve got available,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A young, fit person will only need 10 per cent of their reserve to fight the flu virus, whereas an older adult might need 100 per cent. The body throws absolutely everything at the virus and there’s nothing left for the next thing that comes along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bronchitis means that the lining of the airways is inflamed and irritated,” Dr Strain explains. “&lt;em&gt;Bronchus&lt;/em&gt; is the airways [the tube that carries air from your windpipe into your lungs] and &lt;em&gt;itis &lt;/em&gt;means inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the body’s response to flu but can also be caused by other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a young, healthy person develops bronchitis, the protective layer in their respiratory tract will very quickly heal over,” Dr Strain says. “For older adults, it takes them much, much longer for the protective layers to heal over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, they are vulnerable to a bacterial infection, which occurs if the normal bugs living in the airways penetrate through the damaged mucus lining. This can ultimately lead to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body senses that inflammation has occurred (for example, as a result of bronchitis) and bacteria is present, the immune system releases white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, whose job it is to ward off infection and inflammation, Dr Strain explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But these cells can clog up the alveoli – tiny air sacs in the lungs that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged – so that we can’t breathe properly,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, emergency admissions for pneumonia range between 130,000 to 270,000 per year and it is fatal in 5-14 per cent of hospitalised cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of people who are dying from pneumonia are already in their last two years of life,” Dr Strain explains. For patients with lots of health problems, it’s usually the thing that pushes them over the edge, he adds. Flu and pneumonia were responsible for more than 24,000 deaths (or 4.2 per cent of all deaths in England and Wales) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An influenza infection will cause flu-like symptoms, including a sudden high temperature, an aching body and exhaustion. At this stage, turn to simple paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids to manage symptoms, Dr Strain says. Antibiotics don’t work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a fever burns lots of extra energy, so bringing a fever down with paracetamol will actually help people to get better quicker,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, bronchitis usually clears up on its own within weeks by drinking lots of fluid, getting plenty of rest and taking paracetamol to ease symptoms. “You don’t need to be in hospital if you can continue to drink fluids and still feel lucid,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient has pneumonia, they are usually given antibiotics and get better at home within two to four weeks, though older and at-risk patients will likely be admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as a person starts behaving differently – it could be that they become erratic, hyper-emotional or completely withdrawn – that’s the time we need to see them in hospital,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if they are still at the viral [flu] stage, we need to make sure they’re not at risk of a bacterial infection. It’s a bacterial infection, on top of their viral infection, that’s going to do damage,” he says. Doctors can find out if a bacterial infection has occurred through a quick blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the infection is viral, then the patient will be given fluids and paracetamol, just as they would at home, but if there’s any evidence of a bacterial infection, there will be heavy-duty antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours, Dr Strain says. “Getting on top of that as quickly as possible is really beneficial for patients,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding catching flu or another respiratory infection in the first place is the key step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infections can be unavoidable, sensible steps like avoiding people who’ve got a viral illness – including telling family to delay a visit if they’ve got a cough and cold – is simple but effective, Dr Strain says. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/covid-vaccine-nhs-autumn-jabs/"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; means a flu infection is more likely to be mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prevent frailty by keeping active, Dr Strain says. “Frailty – the inability to tackle infections as they hit you – is what’s going to put you in hospital,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going out for your daily five minute walk to pick up the newspaper, or even just getting out a few times a week, is very clearly demonstrated to boost your immune system,” Dr Strain notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who keep active, they will still feel terrible when hit with a respiratory infection, but they’re going to bounce back from it quickly, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more frail a person is, the longer it will take to recover from pneumonia, he notes. “It can take several months to build your strength back up to where you were and it’s important for those picking up their loved one from hospital to know that they’re not going to be as strong as they were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, we cannot make people live forever,” says Dr Strain. “What we want to do is keep them as healthy as possible until they die. And pneumonia is the thing that tends to be the final straw for people who have problems with their health.”&lt;/p&gt;

This comes after a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_118453245" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-118453245"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years. They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the newly discovered virus HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is still no consensus on the origin of the virus, some studies suggest it originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate animal host.

                                &lt;p&gt;It's Heart Health Month, and heart issues among younger people are becoming more and more common. Cardiologist Dr. Anand Balachandran says overuse of caffeine is a main contributor, and younger people are getting screened earlier than they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says caffeine puts a strain on the cardiovascular system, causing an increased heart rate that can lead to blood pressure issues and heart failure. Balachandran says your body is strong, but too much stress can cause a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran said, "Any stimulant you take, your body is responding to the stimulant just like if you were to make this computer work extra hard, it's going to crash in a matter of time. Similarly, your body is strong. It can resist so many things it has survived decades of everything, it's meant to survive. But when you put it through that stress over time, it's going to show signs of wear and tear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran says his biggest worry when it comes to young people is the overconsumption of highly caffeinated energy drinks. He encourages everyone to practice a healthy lifestyle by staying active, eating healthy, and limiting caffeine as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The worker reported symptoms of illness before the cat got sick. That cat fell ill, tested positive for H5N1 and had to be euthanized. A second cat in that household also got sick, but it recovered. A third cat in the household didn’t get sick and tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LEIFACQK3BD6POU74PZY2X3LQQ"&gt;Meanwhile, an adolescent in the household got sick but tested negative for flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="POO47JWQJRB7TDVF6K7SHIXURE"&gt;The other cat that died lived in a different household. That pet belonged to a dairy worker who transported raw milk and reported frequent splashes of milk on the face, eyes and clothing.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/heritage/heritage-blog/deadly-nightshade-botanical-biography"&gt;Rumored to have killed&lt;/a&gt; the Roman emperor Augustus, nightshade's berries are notoriously deadly. Tomatoes belong to the same plant family, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae"&gt;Solanaceae&lt;/a&gt;, and produce toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, generally, tomatoes don't kill us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kEXuuSFzj2kC&amp;amp;pg=PA12&amp;amp;dq=tomatoes+AND+pewter+plates&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=p0y3UdTQG4aJjALI44GgDQ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=tomatoes%20AND%20pewter%20plates&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;believed to be poisonous&lt;/a&gt;, tomatoes (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato"&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) actually convert their bitter toxins into something more palatable and less deadly. Sichuan University biologist Feng Bai and colleagues have now identified the genetic mechanisms involved in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-a-tomato-is-actually-both-a-fruit-and-vegetable"&gt;tomato fruit's&lt;/a&gt; safe transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Just Discovered How Tomatoes Don't Kill Us" class="size-full wp-image-152887" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Average fruit size in the cultivated tomato in comparison with its semi-domesticated and fully wild relatives. (&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/modern-tomatoes-are-very-different-from-their-wild-ancestors-and-we-found-missing-links-in-their-evolution-130041"&gt;Hamid Razifard/CC BY-ND-4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solanaceae make use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanine"&gt;steroidal glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; as a natural defense against pests. These molecules are thought to mess with animal cell membranes, damaging them and eventually causing cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://molhort.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s43897-024-00118-y"&gt;Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, another member of this toxic family, have been cultivated to have safe levels of these compounds, though they can pump them out when damaged or exposed to large amounts of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, this glycoalkaloid substance tastes unpleasantly bitter. Ingesting too much leads to a burning sensation in the mouth, followed by symptoms including nausea, cramps, slow pulse and reduced breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding, and stomach lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these same plants also need their seeds dispersed, and animals are great at this. So in some of the plants, as their seed-bearing fruits ripen, the bitter toxic chemicals are converted into something more palatable to entice &lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/plant-seed-dispersal-animal-poo"&gt;pooping seed taxis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bai and team discovered that in tomatoes, the chemicals that make the fruits redder, softer, and sweeter also coordinate the breakdown of the toxic glycoalkaloid into a less toxic compound called esculeoside A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[This helps] ensure that high levels of toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids remain in immature fruits to maintain resistance against herbivory attacks, guaranteeing that the fruits reach the seed maturation stage," the team &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliciously fruited plants make use of epigenetic regulation to control the cascade of changes required to make their bounty safe for us to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a protein called DML2 allows the cell's gene-reading machinery to access genes involved in stopping the toxins by removing methyl groups, which act as molecular signals, from a specific part of the genetic chromosome – a process called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demethylation"&gt;demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYHBbEKap0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers genetically disabled the creation of DML2 in the tomatoes, the fruit produced still contained high levels of the steroidal glycoalkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genes involved in other related plants, Bai and team also found &lt;em&gt;DML2-&lt;/em&gt;driven DNA demethylation increased during the tomato plant's domestication, which changed the plants from small berry producers to large red fruit creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the levels of genes supporting steroidal glycoalkaloids also decreased. Now, even green tomatoes can be safely eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes ultimately made this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tomato-juice-can-kill-salmonella-the-bacteria-that-terrorizes-our-guts"&gt;gut-protecting crop&lt;/a&gt; healthier for us all to devour, and in return, we spread tomatoes across new continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, both workers had shown symptoms suggestive of infection, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, a worker who wasn’t employed on a farm but transported unpasteurized milk between farms reported conjunctivitis. The other person worked on a dairy farm and reported seeing several dead barn cats on the premises. He suffered gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting the day before a pet cat became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both workers also ended communication with health officials before the investigation was over, with one citing fear of losing employment for implicating dairy farms, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two adolescents living in one of the worker’s homes also became sick. Both tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., said the paper raises more questions than it answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that cats can become ill with H5N1,” she said. “This paper raises, but does not answer, the question of whether farmworkers may spread H5N1 to their cats. We need to know more about how this may have occurred, as it could inform our understanding of whether people can spread the virus to other animals, including other humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the workers declined to be tested for the virus, the authors could not conclude that they had passed the virus to their pet cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, a 5-year-old indoor cat belonging to one of the dairy workers was brought to a local veterinary clinic after showing decreased appetite, disinterest in grooming, disorientation and tiredness. After not improving over two more days, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University Veterinary Medical Center., where the cat was euthanized after “rapid disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cat’s owner was a dairy farm worker, and there were reports of H5N1 in local dairy farms, the cat’s body was sent to the university’s diagnostic laboratory, where tests confirmed the presence of the virus. That discovery triggered the investigation by state public health officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second dairy worker household, a 6-month-old Maine Coon cat that lived exclusively indoors was brought directly to the Michigan State veterinary clinic. The cat also tested positive for the virus and died 24 hours later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second cat in the household had no symptoms and tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cats’ owner reported not wearing protective equipment and being frequently splashed by milk in the eyes and face, and on clothing. The worker told investigators that the Maine coon cat would often roll in those clothes, something the second cat never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner reported experiencing eye irritation that began two days before the coon cat got sick. The owner wasn’t tested for influenza, declined antiviral treatment and ended communication with the investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is depressing and will continue until we have more severe illnesses reported that scare people,” said John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian and researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his biggest concern is the time lag among infection, symptoms and testing, which can be on the order of three days to two weeks — a pause that enables the virus to move undetected through farms and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are consistently testing humans much too late — after cow herds have shown clinical signs and workers have ‘recovered,’” he said. “If we want to get serious about finding human H5 infections, we’ll need to use rapid tests in [workers’] homes when the eyes first are red, independent of what is happening in the herd on the farm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The workers, the cats, and the bulk milk samples are the best sentinels for early dairy herd diagnoses,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxNcFVhQ2RTYlc3M3hmZmoyUEM2RmwtemFWVWpnemlHVnpDUk1GRjBPTlBYQVRSTHk2X2JZUWJxTzAxRWNaNU9lMDVCcjAzTWcwanAyMkt3RVQ3TWVqSG1YUng0X0IzXy1TZmlqc3c2X0tMdnhsZEJPVy1wSElSMU42bEVQZmg1dldRNmx5WmpmbGZ4R1dkT29pa290UUo3Wi12dWtjQ2t6YlcxNkhKYm1lSEQ5SXVTRDNkekFzaXEyUE1vUG1vTW1Ca0V6Yw</guid></item><item><title>10 Probiotic Foods To Eat Daily For a Strong Immune System - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5hbUllSE1VQWFETDBxalF4SXNBNWlVNTZycU9GT0pxOGNQLTU1cEw2b0w2RVZUVXZMWlRsYVRNcDFQT3hIajZVQjNKeHF6QXBNSUh4QzVNWl8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most widely-consumed fermented food is probably yogurt—but there are many other fermented foods, including miso, sauerkraut, buttermilk, cultured butted, kefir, and kombucha. If you’re shopping for fermented foods at the grocery, look for products labeled with the words “contains live cultures” or “contains active probiotics” to ensure that you are getting as many beneficial live microorganisms if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best probiotic foods for a healthy gut microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Yogurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, yogurt is one of the most popular and readily available probiotic-rich foods. It is made by fermenting milk and is rich in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, both which help to balance intestinal flora and promote digestion. For maximum benefits, choose natural yogurt—preferably organic—that doesn’t contain added sugars or artificial additives. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/greek-yogurt-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is usually the richest in probiotics thanks to its high concentration of protein and milk enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Kefir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir is a fermented beverage similar to yogurt. Although non-dairy versions made from coconut exist, most kefir is derived from milk. Either way, kefir contains a variety of bacterial strains and yeasts, making it one of the richest sources of probiotics. The benefits of kefir go beyond &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/this-is-my-post-dinner-trick-to-reduce-bloating" target="_blank"&gt;reduced bloating&lt;/a&gt; and a strong immune system—it can also improve bone health due to its high calcium content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Ripened cheeses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aged cheeses such as parmesan, gouda, and cheddar contain natural probiotics, thanks to the fermentation process. Although they do not contain as many live microorganisms as yogurt or kefir, aged cheeses are still a good source of beneficial bacteria. They also offer another advantage: they are rich in calcium and fat-soluble vitamins, which contribute to bone health. Plus, aged cheese is delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/a-spoonful-of-apple-cider-vinegar" target="_blank"&gt;apple cider vinegar&lt;/a&gt; a popular &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/glucose-goddess-interview" target="_blank"&gt;blood-sugar balancing&lt;/a&gt; condiment, but it’s also rich in probiotics. Apple cider vinegar is fermented by acid acetic bacteria (AAB), which have beneficial properties for the gut. Consuming unpasteurized apple cider vinegar (preferably organic) helps promote the growth of good bacteria and improve digestion. It can also help balance pH levels in the body, contributing to a healthier microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Kimchi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kimchi-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;Kimchi&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented cabbage or other vegetables and seasoned with spices such as chili, garlic, and ginger. During the fermentation process, Lactobacillus bacteria develop, enriching kimchi with probiotics. It is a food not only rich in probiotics, but also in vitamins and minerals, making it useful for boosting immunity and improving digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;6. Kombucha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-kombucha" target="_blank"&gt;Kombucha&lt;/a&gt; is a fermented tea-based beverage that contains beneficial bacteria and yeasts. Known for its detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties, kombucha is also an excellent source of probiotics. Fermenting the tea with a “SCOBY”—symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast— enriches the beverage with a variety of bacterial strains beneficial to gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;7. Miso&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/miso-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Miso&lt;/a&gt;, a fermented paste made from soybeans, is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Through fermentation with the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, miso is rich in probiotics and can support digestion, improve gut flora, and strengthen the immune system. It is especially useful in a vegetarian and vegan diet as a source of protein, &lt;a href="https://vogue.com/article/deficient-in-vitamin-b12" target="_blank"&gt;B12&lt;/a&gt;, minerals, and—yes—probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;8. Tempeh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tempeh is another type of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fermented-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fermented soybean food&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike miso, it comes in a solid form similar to tofu. Fermentation of tempeh promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria, which improve digestion and contribute to a healthy microbiota. Tempeh makes a great source of plant protein and is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/iron-vitamin-absorption" target="_blank"&gt;rich in iron&lt;/a&gt; and calcium, making it especially ideal for those on a plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;9. Sauerkraut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sauerkraut is fermented cabbage that, like kimchi, contains Lactobacillus bacteria. This food is an excellent source of natural probiotics, as well as vitamin C and vitamin K. Consuming sauerkraut regularly can improve digestion and gut health, and may also promote &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/immune-system-tips" target="_blank"&gt;immune system wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;10. Natto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sticky food is often an acquired taste, but well-worth the adjustment phase thanks to its healthy properties. Made from soybeans fermented with the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, natto is a traditional Japanese food known for its high vitamin K2 content and high probiotic content. Natto aids digestion and can improve bone and cardiovascular health thanks to its natural protein and beneficial enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5hbUllSE1VQWFETDBxalF4SXNBNWlVNTZycU9GT0pxOGNQLTU1cEw2b0w2RVZUVXZMWlRsYVRNcDFQT3hIajZVQjNKeHF6QXBNSUh4QzVNWl8</guid></item><item><title>7 Reasons Why You MUST Regularise Your Bowel Movements - Rediff.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contents cover" animate-in="fly-in-bottom" animate-in-duration="1s"&gt;

Some schools are temporarily closing due to illnesses, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 activity is also high or very high in 30 states, according to wastewater &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:RSV rates are declining;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;RSV rates are declining&lt;/a&gt; but are still higher than they were in early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a respiratory illness, excess mucus is an under-appreciated line of defense from your immune system. But can you really tell what kind of illness you have or where you are in your infection based on your mucus? Here’s a breakdown of what goes on inside our body when we’re sick and why mucus changes colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is mucus? Why does your body produce it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus is the body’s natural moisturizer and provides a first line of defense against irritants from the outside environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lubricates the lining of the nose when it gets too dry but also traps outside invaders, like germs and dust, because of how sticky it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies produce mucus as both a normal way to help maintain good health and to help one fight off infection,” Glatt states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal mucus often looks clear or white for most people, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mucus changes color, depending on the individual’s environment, in response to various germs and more, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does yellow mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus means your body's immune system has been activated, which can change the color or consistency of your mucus, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, during an infection, the mucus will be clear, but it usually changes to yellow within a few days. Many people believe that yellow or green mucus indicates a bacterial infection, but experts caution that color doesn’t correlate to a particular type of infection, as both viruses and bacteria can cause yellow mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus could also be caused by non-infectious triggers, like allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does yellow mucus mean a cold is healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical viral respiratory infection, such as the common cold, mucus in the nose starts out as clear but gradually turns yellow or green as the infection progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So essentially, yellow mucus just means your immune system has been activated. For &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/signs-your-cold-is-getting-better-rcna127645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs your cold is getting better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;signs your cold is getting better&lt;/a&gt;, look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus turning clear again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your symptoms becoming less severe, like having fever body aches and less nasal congestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week has passed and you're feeling overall better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your energy coming back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stage of infection is yellow mucus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It often is an early sign of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Scott Roberts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, however, cautions to not judge mucus by its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends paying more attention to the consistency of the mucus — whether there is thick pus or not — to know if you have a sinus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, thin mucus may be a sign of an early infection, but as the mucus thickens, this suggests more severe congestion in the nose, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does green mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green mucus is also a sign that your body either has encountered an irritant or is experiencing an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mucus may go from a clearer appearance to a much more infected (pus-like) and green appearance in response to viral or bacterial infection,” Glatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus may also change from yellow to green as it becomes more concentrated, often when we are sleeping or not well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that green mucus is a tell-tale sign of a bacterial infection, but both viruses and bacteria can cause this color change. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/march/what-your-nasal-discharge-says-about-your-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:past research has found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;past research has found&lt;/a&gt; that nasal discharge turns different colors due to the presence of white blood cells, which battle the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one clue you might need antibiotics is persistent thick, green discharge lasting for more than 10 days, &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-nasal-mucus-color-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do other mucus colors mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus often changes colors when dead cells, germs and other substances, like blood or tobacco smoke, gets mixed with it, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. These colors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink: &lt;/strong&gt;Mucus can turn pink after an injury to the nose when it gets streaked with blood. It can also be a sign your nasal passages are so dry that tiny blood vessels that line them have burst and leaked blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be a sign of a more severe infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is also common during colder seasons (when the air in our homes have less humidity), which leads to dry nasal passages that cause small amounts of blood from tiny burst blood vessels in the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black&lt;/strong&gt;: This could be old, dried blood. The mucus can also turn black when environmental irritants, like dust particles, smoke or other air pollutants, get stuck in the nasal passages. Serious fungal infections can darken mucus as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get rid of mucus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Druckman says “fluids and rest are key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making sure you’re drinking enough water will help flush out any mucus and help thin it out, and getting adequate rest will help your body heal faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way to reduce the effects of mucus is to place a humidifier in your room, which can help loosen your mucus a bit and make it easier to manage,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For optimal drainage, it’s recommended to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to ease symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other home remedies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal rinses, which help clear the mucus from your nose and sinuses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decongestants to temporarily decrease inflammation in the nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectorants to thin out the mucus so it’s easier to clear it out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines to calm down the body’s immune system, which causes excess mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel something is exactly right about the color or consistency of your mucus, check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of symptoms also matters. You should also seek medical attention if you have persistent colored mucus and symptoms for more than a week, Druckman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other warning signs are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark-colored mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much blood mixed in with mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thick nasal discharge with facial pain lasting longer than 10 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent fevers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runny nose with a persistent cough or chest tightness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms not improving with home remedies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To stay protected, I recommend getting the flu vaccine, washing hands frequently, and staying home when feeling unwell,” Druckman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking these steps can help reduce the spread and protect yourself and those around you during flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/yellow-mucus-meaning-rcna192836" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:21:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE41RVhUZEpCMXZQOXRXaGtFXzV6YzFnNnFTeXJBSEZKSTBNZW5Ha2tSUlJuN2ZPUXIzZnhVY3BqZmVWTHlDcmNfYnZBbXhwQUtHLTRPMnl1em1Hd1FRU3lpdTFWRkp5czZVSUJYZnBRUHVaaXdw</guid></item><item><title>A New Study Reveals Eating These Seeds Could Do Wonders for Your Health - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Chia Seeds Really Are That Healthy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fcafotodigital - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many foods these days sport "health halos," meaning that they are touted all over social media as super healthy, even if they don’t deliver (we're looking at you, coconut oil and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a44852/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apple cider vinegar!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;apple cider vinegar!&lt;/a&gt;).

In addition to omega-3s, protein, fiber, Iu notes that chia seeds are rich in minerals like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these nutrients have positive effects on your body, recent research shows. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; from Iraq and Iran found that chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol, could potentially help lower body weight and may help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chinese researchers are looking into why that is, and &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo02197a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bioactive-molecule" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bioactive macromolecular substances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bioactive macromolecular substances&lt;/a&gt; like oil, protein and gum.

Chia seeds can even help relieve constipation by adding bulk to your stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to bring some chia love into your diet? Here’s how to use chia seeds to your best nutritional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat chia seeds every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can indeed eat them every day. “A serving size of chia seeds is 1 tablespoon,” says &lt;a href="https://anitamirchandani.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and personal trainer in New York City, who recommends one serving a day. “A little goes a long way!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you overdo chia seeds, they could make you pretty uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; – think: major gas and bloating. “Be cautious with chia seeds if you have digestive issues like irritable bowel disease, or if you're sensitive to high fiber,” says Iu. “The right amount to consume will vary by individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:specifically reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;specifically reports&lt;/a&gt; that a serving of chia seeds (which they count as 2.5 tbs) contains 10 grams of fiber. When sprinkling chia seeds on yogurt or into a chicken salad, it’s not hard to use that much. But even if you don’t have digestive sensitivity, eating more than that could give you diarrhea. Your smartest move, says Iu, is to take things slowly, see how you feel after trying a single tablespoon of chia seeds, and if you feel good, gradually increase the amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some great ways to use chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although chia seeds can be eaten raw, eating them with soft or liquid consistency foods can help your body get used to them more easily (and it is possible to choke if you scarf too many dry chia seeds at once.) Chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health-products/g43632266/best-fiber-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and so absorb liquid and expand. “Chia seeds can be added to oatmeal or &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g4060/healthy-smoothie-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mirchandani. “I’ve heard people add it to rice dishes because of the consistency, too. My go-to is to soak chia seeds overnight in milk or water, making them into a pudding to have the next morning.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mykola Sosiukin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it’s time to experiment more. “You can sprinkle chia seeds onto yogurt, or enjoy them as a crunchy addition to salad,” says Moore. “You can also stir chia seeds into cooked berries to make a simple berry jam. They’re versatile in the kitchen – chia seeds are non-perishable, putting nutrition conveniently at your fingertips.” Iu keeps her chia seeds in a cute glass jar in her kitchen: “I keep it visible near my breakfast items, which makes it easy for me to sprinkle chia seeds over toast or in &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35688305/congee-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:congee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;congee&lt;/a&gt; or juices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What not to do: &lt;strong&gt;Don’t add loads of butter or sugar to your chia dish – that pretty much negates the overall health-factor. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should not eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are allergic to chia seeds. A study from Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)02196-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that this allergy is rare;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;found that this allergy is rare&lt;/a&gt;, and most often affects Hispanic women and those who have a sensitivity to sesame. Chia seed allergy can cause &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fanaphylaxis%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20351468&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa63785578%2Fare-chia-seeds-really-healthy%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anaphylaxis,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;anaphylaxis, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so if you have any reason to think you might be allergic to them, have your health care provider do a prick test of your skin before you try them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other folks who should give them a miss are those who have trouble swallowing, says Moore, and eating too many at once for anyone could be a choking hazard. Be especially careful about giving chia seeds to your kids for this reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE</guid></item><item><title>Ultraprocessed Foods: How Bad Could They Be? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOU3F0QjE3cTl1SVdyQVVNSnFoc3BTUkxrSkdfWThyVTJwREk3OXI5M3I4Y2dkM2RRcVRGVUJQUGtRZzJ0R1AxWElodUtVa2RHb0I3VWtTTHRzRUQtTHR1czRNbXhSRGZjZXcySURPMVhidTdMblFPaEtXZkFlalhVdzVhVGQxLUlVZmZGdjBRMUJpYUpMMHFJVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today, I'm sitting down with my colleague and my friend, CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell. You know, Meg is a really talented journalist. She writes. She's on TV all the time. She's guest hosted a few episodes of this podcast. But as you just heard, Meg's other full time job, more important job is mom to two young boys. How much do you think about their their diet?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's kind of a balance for me between letting my anxiety take over about what they're not eating and all the nutrients I'm worried they're not getting, and just making sure they get enough calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:52
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like all great reporters, Meg lets her personal curiosity lead the way. And lately, she's been doing some deep dives on something we see all around us, but definitely don't know enough about ultra processed foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like, how are you supposed to figure out, like, what's healthy to eat? Are you supposed to avoid 70% of foods in our food system?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

                00:01:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'And I do want to point out that ultra processed foods contain ingredients that you would not typically find in your kitchen. Some are even made using industrial cooking methods not accessible to the average home chef. Now, Meg has talked about this topic before on the podcast, but I wanted to invite her back to discuss the latest science of ultra processed foods because, in part, the quality of our food supply has been a hot topic during the RFK Jr's confirmation hearings, and also because Meg recently took this really fascinating reporting trip to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health researchers there are trying to answer two fundamental questions. Number one, what is it that actually makes ultra processed foods so bad for us? And number two, could those ultra processed foods one day be considered healthy? I know, I know. Ultra-processed foods being healthy? Well, the answers could shape U.S. food policy. They could guide how we feed ourselves and our families for a long time to come. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Oh, and one more thing. Meg and I took a close look at what goes into some of my favorite foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I have heard from my inside sources.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Uh-oh, you're inside sources may not like me, so I'm scared. It was, let's just say, an enlightening experience. I remember your last time you were on the podcast talking about this. If you can't buy these ingredients, or if you wouldn't do this at home yourself, that's probably a good indication that what you're eating is ultra processed. Fair?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                00:03:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And when you read these ingredient list, there's a lot of things on there that you would never buy in a store. You would never add these things to yourself. So you go to the grocery store you're trying to buy well, for your for yourself, your family, your husband. How much of what you're buying is likely to be ultra processed?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Unless you're trying to avoid it the majority of the stuff that you're going to find is probably ultra processed. I mean, unless you're going to the bakery section, we don't know what the freshly baked breads, that might not be ultra processed, but it might be. You don't know.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, if you asked, would you know? And how would you find out?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, probably. You could probably ask for the ingredients list and see if there's any weird thing in there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I don't know, but no one does that. Right. Because it seems like I need to go buy my groceries and like, I might do it after talking to you, but it's where, I guess if you buy, if you eat meat. Going to the to the fresh meat section, you could probably be pretty confident that it's not ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Probably. Deli meat though, you know, might have some preservatives or some other things in it that could make it ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'll ask some version of this question a couple times, but as as difficult and maybe even dire as that all sounds, is it necessarily bad for you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's the question that scientists are trying to answer now. And the studies that we've had up until now, there have been a lot of them. Dozens and dozens have showed a lot of negative health effects linked to ultra processed foods. They're looking back at people's diets, and they find that people who report eating more ultra processed foods have higher levels of obesity, diabetes, even anxiety, and even things like all cause mortality, which you know, is a confusing thing. It's like we're all going to die, but are you going to die sooner if you eat more ultra processed foods? It seems like yeah, maybe. But the problem with these studies is they're backwards looking. So scientists have just started to try to run these, randomized controlled trials of how people eat. And that requires trapping people so they can't cheat. So we went down to the NIH, where they've been running these studies. Some of the only studies like this in the world, the first one they ran came out in 2019, and that was just looking at ultra processed foods versus minimally processed foods. People had to live at the NIH for a month. You know, half the time they're on the minimally processed diet and half the time they're on the ultra processed diet. They were giving them basically identically matched diets based on the nutrients in them. And you know, how the foods looked and things like that. But at the end of this time, they found, that people on average, ate about 500 calories more per day on the ultra processed diet, and over two weeks they gain about 2 pounds. So they were offered the same number of calories on each of the diets, and they ended up eating more calories on the ultra processed diet, perhaps without realizing it, because there's something about ultra processed foods that just made folks eat more of them and that made them gain weight.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                00:06:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, it's funny going back to these just basic definitions. I think a lot of people, and even as I was thinking about this podcast with you, I was talking to my wife about this. I said, just like, what is your your immediate instinct when you think of ultra processed foods? And she immediately said the additives, like, might they be toxic in some way? Might they be increasing my risk of cancer or something like that? Right? I'm not sure I even got asked this question, Meg, but but how much of this is about the additives are bad versus what they're doing in terms of making me crave it that's bad?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We don't know yet. But now Doctor Kevin Hall at the NIH is running that study.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What we're trying to understand is what are the mechanisms? What is it about this category of foods that is driving people to overconsume calories, potentially leading to obesity and these downstream consequences?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So he took the results of the first studies, looked at the clues they got from how people chose to eat in that trial. And he has two hypotheses about what might be driving overeating with ultra processed foods. One is their energy density. So how many calories you're getting in each gram of food you're eating. And it so happens that ultra processed foods are much more energy dense than minimally processed foods. And he says, really that's because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don't like rot. They're more shelf stable. And then the other thing he's hypothesizing is they're hyper palatability, or we've heard the term the bliss point. So it's this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs that's just the right levels that make us like, not want to stop eating foods. And so what he's done is with their nutrition team, devised four different diets. One is minimally processed, one is ultra processed, very similar to the first trial. High hyper palatability, high energy dense. And then two other diets that kind of mix. They're ultra processed, but they vary how hyper palatable they are and how energy dense they are. And what he's trying to see is, can you eat a diet that's made up mostly of ultra processed foods, but that doesn't drive overeating and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it's less energy dense or if it's less hyper palatable.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And if we can figure that out, then we can provide our, you know, our our colleagues at the FDA, for example, regulators with information about, you know, how they might want to label foods for example.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When he was doing this research, I'm sure these these participants who are in the trial, they they knew why they were they're being studied. Did you get a chance to talk to any of them? I'm curious what their sort of experience was going through a study like this, because you have to be in the you're essentially an inpatient, right?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So we got to meet one of the participants in this trial. There's only 36 of them. So it was like really cool to get to meet one of these 36 people who's going to potentially influence the way we think about our food and food policy. Same. Sam Reseda, he's 20. He is a pre-med student. So he's in college, which I thought was super cool. So how long have you been here?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's been fine. I mean, I have my PlayStation, my electronics. Honestly feels like a dorm room for me.

              And, yeah, he's, he's allowed to go outside. But somebody has to follow him, you know?
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Really make sure you can't go sneak a Snickers bar.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Go to a vending machine. There was a vending machine strangely close to the metabolic ward. I was like, come on, guys, it's like, why are you doing this for these people? And they track almost everything you can track about a person. He was wearing a continuous glucose monitor. He's wearing, like, three trackers of his movement. They were doing stool samples so they could look at what's going on with this microbiome. They were taking regular blood from him and separating that into all these components to see the effects of food on all kinds of things, including his immune system. And then one of the other things that makes the NIH one of the only places in the world that can do this kind of study is they have one of these things called a metabolic chamber. Participants like Sam come in here for 24 hours at a time, once a week. This room measures literally the air they breathe in and breathe out. They're trying to measure their metabolism, and the only way they can get them food is they've got this little window that, you know, they open on one side, but the food and clothes he opens on the other side.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Kind of sounds like prison.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And he's in there for 24 hours. I asked him how he feels when it comes out. He's like, it's like coming out of one of those, like, cryogenic freezers or like Austin Powers or something.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When you say that this might impact food policy and this is a what if sort of crystal ball question, but what might that look like? You have a study like this that Kevin Hall is doing at the NIH. What could that translate to?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, his hope is that he can, you know, generate this evidence. That'll be good, strong evidence telling us these answers about food. And if he finds, you know, that foods that are super hyper palatable and high in energy density do lead to this overeating, you can provide that information to a regulator like the FDA as they're considering food policy. Does that change the way you label food? Do you put like, a green light on something that's low energy density and low hyper palatable and or whatever other metrics that are found to be important, or is it used in a different way by regulators? You know, we've we've heard about initiatives to try to lower salt in foods, for example. Could you mandate that food companies lower the the bliss point of some of their foods. Can can you do that kind of thing. I mean we, we don't know. But Kevin Hall wants to provide the information so that regulators can figure out what to do with it, but also so that we as consumers have more information and feel better equipped when we walk into the grocery store. If you could still get these very convenient foods and lower cost foods, but they wouldn't cause those problems. That could help us a lot without just saying, okay. When you go to the grocery store, you can only go to the vegetable section. You can only go to the, you know, the butcher or whatever it is coming up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Meg and I are going to discuss some of those challenges of food regulation, and also, importantly, what lessons you should take to the grocery store the next time you go. I remember I interviewed Michelle Obama years ago when she was very focused on food, and it was a wide ranging discussion. But one of the things that sort of jumped out at me was this idea that, you know, if you're trying to feed a family of five and you go to McDonald's, you know, you can buy a lot of calories for cheap. And I don't know how much of that just the cost of calories has driven sort of where we are now. But, you know, 20, 25 bucks and you can feed your family that night versus going and buying all these, less processed, minimally processed, highly watered, dense foods that are, I think, agreeably good for you but just aren't going to leave your kids satisfied. There's still going to be maybe hungry because there wasn't enough calories in that. How much do you think this is just about cost?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think a lot of it is about cost. In the first study, they also looked at the costs to prepare the diets, and these were being prepared by chefs. So we're not even talking about the time it took to prepare these diets. But the cost, it was significantly more expensive to eat a minimally processed diet than an ultra processed diet. I think it was like almost 50%.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Really that much more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. But, you know, it's it's convenient. It's less expensive to eat ultra processed foods. I mean, having to prepare an entire meal for minimally processed foods can take hours. I mean, I'm not a very good cook. I try to do it like on weekends, but it's really hard. And one of the things that really made me feel better was I asked Kevin Hall how he feeds his own family. He's got little kids. Yeah, he still gives them chicken nuggets, you know? And for me, I'm like, oh, I'm on the Applegate farm ones. Those are fine, right? Like, you know, I'm sure there's like different degrees of, like, ultra processed chicken nuggets. I'm just happy they're eating chicken. I hope it's chicken.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. Our definition of what is acceptable and even healthy changes when you have kids. I think for sure. And I will admit that I found myself eating my kids food often.  You know, cleaning up their plate when they hadn't eaten there. There is. That's a mix of why I gained weight. Maybe I'm starting to lose weight a little bit now because my kids have just gotten older.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not eating their scraps anymore?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm not eating the scraps anymore. You know, one thing that comes up a lot and you may or may not know the answer to this, but, you know, people will often say to me, like, I'll go to Italy or I go to Europe and I'll, I'll eat basically the same foods, like I have pasta dinners. I might even have some dessert and things like that. And I find myself feeling better, not gaining as much weight. Maybe even losing weight despite having the same diet. I guess the question is, how unique is the United States and all this?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'It's not unique. But it is - We do have a lot of our calories from ultra processed foods. It is sort of happening all over the world. But you also do hear about how in Europe they have a different approach to regulating additives in food and regulating all sorts of things, you know. I think it's called the precautionary principle, where they actually think, okay, we should figure out what this does, maybe before we allow it to be in our products. Whereas in the United States, we often sort of allow things to come in and then we we see what effect they have. And, I think a lot of folks think that that is potentially a problem.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:15:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. You know, it's interesting, I think, for for physicians and people in the health care field, precautionary principles, is almost all the part of our DNA. Like, why wouldn't we just do that. And then you find for certain products, foods, but also things like makeup and things like that. They have these these different supply and production chains in Europe for some of these products versus the United States. So they were even in Canada where they won't they won't include certain ingredients in their foods. And so and I think the, the instinct, I think in the United States is often to say, well, that's why why are we doing this here? And that's terrible there, but it's more nuanced than that. I mean, you know, part of the reason, like even the Fruit Loops, that's come up a lot recently because of what RFK has been saying about that, I think people intuitively is like, yeah, why why are Fruit Loops have more chemicals than in Canada? And what the what the cereal manufacturers will say is, "look, we know, first of all, you're not telling us something we don't know." But also we've tried this and people didn't buy the products.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And and I guess that again, I don't know there's an answer to this, but but fundamentally, even if we learn all these things from Kevin Hall's study and all this. People like what they like. And they like the choice. And they're going to eat what they want to eat anyway, right? Even if they're informed by new labeling or whatever. How optimistic do you think he is? Or maybe even you are, that this will actually lead to to any kind of measurable change?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the cereal thing is super interesting, because if you have a situation where you're pressuring a company into removing something and that's all you're doing, you're just pressuring them, you're not requiring them to remove something, okay? They try it. Sales go down 10%. So they brought it back, you know, and sales bounced back okay. If you require them to do it they can't bring it back afterwards. So that's the question. It's like how are you going to deal with these things? Just pressuring companies. I mean I've covered the drug industry for a long time. They've dealt with a lot of pressure over their pricing practices. It works for a little, little while. They'll always find ways to raise prices again if they're allowed to. Yeah. I mean, so that's the question is regulation versus pressure. I asked Doctor Hall how optimistic he was that research like this would change anything about the way companies approach the food they make, because they want to sell more food. Of course they want to make it more delicious. They want you to eat more of it. And he was saying, well, you know, a soda company doesn't care whether it's selling you regular soda or diet soda. They don't care how many calories they're selling you because they can price side the same way. And so he sort of use that as analogy of maybe we can change these things. And, and also through behaviors, if you give people information maybe they can use that to, you know, make buying choices that influence what companies do.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:11
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, you know, one area that policy often goes, as you well know better than anybody is pricing. And the idea that some products would cost more than others, could, could be something that happens. And personally and I, I'm not an expert, but I think that's a dangerous slope because when you start to think about things like syntaxes, you know, I'm going to charge a tax for something that we now think is sinful in some way. I don't know, I feel like you're punishing people to buy calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nicotine. I put in a different, different category because it really has no redeeming qualities. But food is food. And, you know, you'd rather people eat good, healthy, not super energy dense, calorie dense food. But again, you could feed your family for a five for 25 bucks, that's a pretty good deal. Are you going to put a tax on that and in a sense punish people for that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right. That would disproportionately hurt the people who already find food difficult to afford. So there is a huge issue with doing that. And I think that's part of a lot of pushback around all this focus on ultra processed foods. But that probably doesn't mean we shouldn't understand what processed foods do. It's just what do you do with that information? I think there is evidence to suggest with cigarettes, which of course are very different from food. You don't need them to live.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But they have found that taxing those is one of the most effective ways to discourage people from using cigarettes. With food, it's a different question, and I think some places are trying this. And, you know, of course, in New York City, Michael Bloomberg tried to put a tax on soda and it failed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I you know, I so I interviewed Michael Bloomberg as well about this. And it was it's actually one of the funniest interviews. First of all, he starts off even before we started rolling, he said, I just want to tell you, Sanjay, I love Cheetos. I know I never get that. And I'm like, oh, that's very interesting, Mr. Mayor. Like, you love Cheetos. Things like, why leave the interview with me?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It was a skeleton in his closet. That he needed to put out there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I just want to get this out of the way. I'm a Cheeto lover. But he had this thing. Obviously, part of it was pricing. But the other part was that if you went to a movie theater, you could no longer buy a 16 ounce sofda, you could buy an eight ounce. And if you wanted, you could buy two, eight ounce sodas. So then you could have your 16oz, but you couldn't buy a 16 ounce in one glass. And I said tell me about that. And he was making this point that I'm adding these micro blocks. This is part policy. But part of this is just psychology. I'm just saying I'm going to make it. Even if it's not more expensive. It's just slightly more difficult for people. And there might be enough people out there who say, hey, eight ounce is enough. I'll just, you know, take that as a micro block.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And then something with soda. I mean, that's not necessarily in the same category as a meal. So worrying about the, the tax on on folks who are for...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So are, you know, in terms of takeaways for people like I, you know, I've often been told read the ingredients. If you can't pronounce some of the ingredients, probably not a good thing to buy. Is that kind of how you just simply approach things when you go grocery shopping?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. But after learning more about this and talking more with Kevin Hall, I. I suspect it's more nuanced than that. And I also, I'm giving myself a little bit of a break as a parent of young kids who love goldfish crackers.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:24
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They have a lot of ingredients you can't pronounce in the goldfish cracker.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Cracker, including, I think smiles are, an ingredient in goldfish crackers listed in the ingredients list. I definitely I mean, I guess I can make those in my own kitchen, so there we go.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:36
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Do they really have that listed in the ingredients?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Good for them.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So I haven't totally changed the way, but I do, I do think about it more for sure.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:45
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But this whole thing about not being able to pronounce and we're going to look at some of these products here in a second. But if you can't buy it yourself, the ingredient in the food that you're about to eat. From what I've seen, from what you've reported in the past, that that's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. If you're trying to avoid ultra processed foods, it's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And people should avoid ultra processed foods. I guess we're coming right back to the beginning of this discussion again. So should I, based on everything you know, it sounds like a good idea to avoid ultra processed foods. They might be too hyper palatable. They might make me eat too much, even unknowingly. And they have all these ingredients that some of. We don't know what they do, but just in terms of precautionary principle might be a good thing to avoid.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, if you can. I think it's a good I mean, I'm not a doctor. You are. You can say that, but.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:31
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, again, some of this, to be to be fair to, is we don't have a lot of data to show whether or not some of these ingredients are necessarily bad for people. But if you're if you're trying to apply this precautionary principle and anyone who's listening should maybe think about this a little bit and maybe even look it up and think about how you want to live your life in terms of precautionary principle, there's a lot of things that we do in our lives to avoid something. It's not that it's necessarily going to be a harm to us, but hey, I'd rather not take the chance. But when it comes to some of these ingredients, I don't know. I'm just listening to you. And I don't know that it makes a difference. And I'm a doctor because again, we don't have data on a lot of these things. But I think precautionary principle is pretty sound when it comes to some ingredients that I can't pronounce.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. The way I think about it is like, if I'm in the grocery store and I've got two loaves of bread in front of me and I can look at the ingredients, I'm going to choose the one with the ingredients I recognize all else being equal. If that cost twice as much. Maybe I'll think about it a little more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This I mean, this this fundamentally is probably what's going to drive the policy discussion, because I think you're absolutely right. If it cost twice as much. People may choose with their with their wallet more so than their precautionary principle. You know, and that'll be a really interesting discussion to have going forward. Maybe we can talk about that in a future podcast.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. We'll see what happens.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Just what's the timetable on any of this? So the studies are ongoing. How long will they take to complete and have real results? And then what? What happens next?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So Kevin Hall's current study, he expects to be done by the middle of 2025. And to have results, he hopes, at least in a pre-print -- so not peer reviewed, published in a journal necessarily -- but to have the results out there in the world by the end of 2025 or early 2026. So these things take a long time. This is slow. And there's not a lot of it going on, and there's a lot of demand for change even before we get these data sets. And already, you know, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee is meeting to talk about what's going to go in 2025 to 2030s dietary guidelines. And these won't necessarily change huge amounts of things, but they are important. And they're not they're not considering ultra processed foods. Really. Because they think there's not enough evidence to to help them make decisions about it for this upcoming set. So we're talking about 2030 for that. But whether there could be actions that take place sooner than that. And how much science they're based on and, you know, we're going to have to see and I think industry will push back based on what they say is a lack of evidence.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:25:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And I mean, I think this idea of what, what level of evidence is necessary in order to implement policy change is a question that comes up, not just in health care, but I think in many aspects of our society a lot. And and how cautious we want to be. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out. I'm fascinated by it. But, you know, I'm a doctor. I think that, 70% roughly of chronic disease in this country is preventable. This is according to studies that I've read and reporting I've done over 20 years. And I think a lot of that is in some way, shape or form based on how we nourish ourselves. Food is the only signal that we consciously give from our outside world to our inside world on a daily basis. We're informing our inside world with with our food. You know, I just think we should be really thoughtful about it based on the best evidence. But as you said at the beginning of this podcast, that evidence is really hard to collect. These aren't the 10,000, you know, huge clinically controlled trials that people would like. And I think what regulators probably need to understand is we may never have that kind of data. So how do you act in the meantime? That's going to be a really good question. So you have a bag of...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I brought you treats! Okay. So I asked Ben Tinker, the head of health, and Sanjay, longtime producer. What Sanjay's favorite treat is. Do you know what it is?

              All right. Do you have reading glasses? I can't even I can't even read this anymore.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Okay, so, here are the ingredients. Okay. Cream, skim milk, liquid sugar, which is sugar and water. Water. Wheat flour. It's probably the cookie dough we're talking about here.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Sugar. Brown sugar, egg yolks. Butter, which is cream and salt. Expeller pressed soybean oil. Eggs. Coconut oil. Chocolate liqueur. Cocoa, processed with alkali. Cocoa, molasses, guar gum, salt, vanilla extract, natural flavor, cocoa butter, invert sugar, carrageenan, milk fat, tapioca flour, soy lecithin, annatto extract for color, turmeric extract for color, and milk.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I got to tell you, in some ways I. That's a lot. But I thought I was going to be worse. I thought there's gonna be a lot of things in there that we're going to be these multi, multi syllabic words that I couldn't possibly pronounce. What do you think when you read that list?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a lot of ingredients. I mean probably to explain the chocolate chip cookie dough. Maybe I should have gotten just vanilla so we could compare. But something like carrageenan.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. What is?

              I don't know. I think it's some kind of maybe gum. I'm not really sure what that is. Or. And I certainly have never used it in my own kitchen.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Okay, so this is I had to really scour the shelves, which is why I was a little bit late coming in here this morning to try to find an ice cream that was not ultra processed. Let's see, where is the ingredient list? It's so small, I can't find it. Okay. Ingredients. Milk. Cane. Sugar. Cream. Cocoa powder. Processed with alkali. I don't know what that is. Tapioca syrup. Nonfat milk. That was the closest thing I could find to non-ultra processed. I don't know what the alkali thing is, so maybe that's still ultra processed. Here's the thing about these two, though. Does that make this one more healthy than that one?
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Kevin Hall doesn't think so. His hypothesis is that you're going to this is so hyper palatable. This is so energy dense. Even if it's minimally processed, it is going to drive you to eat to the same degree that the ultra processed ice cream is going to drive you to overeat. That's what his study is trying to figure out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's really interesting. I think I think that's a it's a it's a great point to sort of leave things on that at the same time that, we may have these preconceived notions of just how, how problematic ultra processed foods are. Maybe there are other foods that may not be as processed that still have that, that really high energy density, that hyper palatability, that are still going to really make you eat. And kind of knowing yourself in this regard probably is maybe the most important thing. But a pleasure always, I always enjoyed, enjoy talking to you.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in West Texas is continuing to spread. And with kindergarten vaccination rates dipping across the country, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down" target="_blank"&gt;more communities may be at risk of outbreaks.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not just kids who should be vaccinated. Infectious disease experts say some adults may need to get revaccinated, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles can spread incredibly fast — it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;one of the world's most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, more than flu, polio, Covid, or just about any other infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, notes that just last week, West Texas was reporting 14 cases. This week, it's up to 58 cases. "It's very hard to control measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The best defense against measles is vaccination. The vast majority of people getting sick in Texas are unvaccinated. And the measles vaccine is both safe and highly effective, says &lt;a href="https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/27990" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you have been vaccinated with two doses of vaccine as per routine, you have a 95-plus percent chance of being completely protected throughout your life," Schaffner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But public health experts say there are some adults who should consider getting revaccinated. That includes older adults who were born after 1957 and were vaccinated before 1968. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because early versions of the measles vaccine were made from an inactivated (killed) virus, which didn't work particularly well, Offit says. That's why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends that anyone vaccinated before 1968&lt;/a&gt; get at least one dose of the live attenuated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, nearly everyone got the disease during childhood. So people born before 1957 are assumed to have natural immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner says if you're not sure of your immunity or vaccination status, there's no harm in getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you were vaccinated between 1968 and 1989, you likely received just one dose of the measles vaccine, instead of the two doses that are standard today. One dose alone is highly effective and for most people, it provides more than enough protection, says Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/1232304335/booster-shots-measles" target="_blank"&gt;author of &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;, a book on the history of measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Ratner says there are several situations in which the CDC recommends an additional dose of measles vaccine for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;adults who are considered at high risk&lt;/a&gt;. That includes people who are in college settings, work in health care, live or are in close contact with immunocompromised people, or are travelling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're traveling somewhere where there's an active outbreak and you're not sure that you got two doses, it may not be crazy to get a second dose," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if you live in a community which is experiencing a measles outbreak, your local or state health department may recommend a second dose for adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's worthwhile to make sure you're protected, because adults over 20 are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;complications from measles&lt;/a&gt;, which can include pneumonia and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780576486/samoa-closes-schools-and-mandates-vaccinations-amid-deadly-measles-epidemic" target="_blank"&gt;can also be dangerous — if not deadly — for children.&lt;/a&gt; As many as 1 in 20 kids with measles will get pneumonia, and 1 out of 1,000 will develop encephalitis, or brain swelling — which can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;lead to death or cause deafness or intellectual disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, kindergarten vaccination rates have fallen below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks. In some parts of the U.S., rates are far lower. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/g-s1-49648/up-first-newsletter-measles-west-texas-jair-bolsonaro-china-funding" target="_blank"&gt;That includes Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, the epicenter of the state's outbreak, where the vaccination rate is only at about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit says vaccination is the best way to protect children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I lived through the 1991 Philadelphia measles epidemic, where there were 1,400 cases and nine deaths over a period of three months," he says. "So I've seen children suffer needlessly because of the choice not to get a vaccine. So please, vaccinate your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      
      Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified &lt;i&gt;FAM171A2&lt;/i&gt; as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &amp;gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2-α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.

&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question for both farmers and government officials is how the virus gets onto farms in the first place. Some transmission routes—such as direct contact with wild birds, contaminated feed or drinking water, and movement by people through contaminated clothing or equipment—are well-documented, and biosecurity measures are taken at many farms to minimize exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, new research sheds light on an often-overlooked mechanism: windborne transmission. A &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" aria-label="recent study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1"&gt;recent study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents compelling genetic and meteorological evidence that H5N1 can travel significant distances via wind, challenging the conventional wisdom and highlighting the need to reconsider outbreak mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Screen shot from USDA APHIS website, February 20, 2025. &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Evidence for an Epidemiological Link&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted after an outbreak of H5N1 in the Czech Republic in February 2024, examined how the virus spread from a duck farm to two chicken farms located approximately 8 km away. Genetic sequencing revealed striking similarities between the virus strains at these farms, with some isolates from the duck farm 100% identical to those found in the chicken farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, extensive field investigations ruled out several possible transmission routes. There were no direct interactions between the companies managing the farms, no contaminated feed or water sources, and no major water bodies nearby to facilitate spread via wild birds. The study also ruled out human-associated transmission and even rodent-mediated spread. Given these findings, wind emerged as the most plausible explanation for how the virus traveled between the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meteorological Correlation and Windborne Spread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorological data provided further support for the windborne transmission hypothesis. Between February 4 and 7, prevailing winds blew consistently from the west or southwest (250–300 degrees), aligning with the suspected transmission route. Wind speeds averaged around 4 meters per second, with gusts reaching 8–10 meters per second on February 5. The study determined the optimal period for airborne viral transmission occurred from noon on February 4 to midnight on February 5. At these wind speeds, the virus could have made the distance between the two farms in just 13-22 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Airborne transmission, especially over distances of 8 km, is not typically considered a major route for H5N1 transmission. However, this study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Map showing duck farm and chicken farms connected by windborne spread of H5N1 avian influenza. Map &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; drawn by E. Marty from data reported in a study of an outbreak in the Czech Republic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eric Marty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Tunnel Ventilation Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant insights from the study is the role of tunnel ventilation systems in facilitating windborne spread. These ventilation systems function like high-volume air samplers, creating negative pressure inside poultry houses that draws in huge quantities of ambient air effectively concentrating whatever particulates may be in that air, in this case infectious virions of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the infection period, ventilation rates at the affected chicken farms were exceptionally high. These conditions likely allowed airborne viral particles to accumulate and reach infectious doses. Notably, on the affected chicken farms, outbreaks in chicken houses began near air intake systems. On farm C, the researchers inferred that transmission between chicken houses likely originated in the house with the largest bird population and highest ventilation rate, making it the most plausible first recipient of airborne virus from farm B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Outbreak Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have significant implications for HPAI outbreak response and biosecurity measures. Conventionally, only dust generated during depopulation efforts has been considered a major risk factor for airborne transmission. However, this study suggests that aerosols produced by infected flocks may be more significant carriers of the virus, as heavier dust particles tend to settle quickly near the outbreak site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this new understanding of transmission dynamics, poultry farms and animal health officials should consider whether or not existing biosecurity protocols that focus on direct contact and contamination are adequate. Should airborne mitigation strategies now be considered, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more research is needed to determine if poultry houses with tunnel ventilation systems need additional filtration or air purification technologies to minimize airborne virus spread, especially in places where chicken farms are located close to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study provides strong genetic and meteorological evidence for windborne transmission in this case, there are limitations to air sampling studies. Detecting minute concentrations of viral particles over long distances is challenging. The absence of detection in some studies does not necessarily rule out windborne spread, highlighting the need for continued research into the aerodynamics of viral transmission in poultry settings. In the meantime it’s worth reconsidering if airborne transmission might account for some of the incursions into otherwise biosecured facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reshapes our understanding of H5N1 transmission, presenting robust evidence that windborne spread plays a larger role than previously recognized. By highlighting the role of tunnel ventilation systems and optimal wind conditions, the research underscores the need for enhanced airborne transmission control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When you've eaten a good meal at a restaurant and the waiter asks, "Got any room for dessert?" where does the voice that craves a gratuitous slice of pie come from? &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your brain. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists now have a better understanding of the neural origins of this urge thanks to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1510"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mice brains are structurally similar to human brains. So, to isolate the neural pathways responsible for "dessert brain," the researchers turned to mice. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research fed mice to the point of fullness and then gave them sugar. In doing so, they found that the same neurons signaling satiety, or fullness, also released β-Endorphin, a naturally-occurring opiate. This chemical bound to opiate receptors in the mice brains and triggered a feeling of reward. When the team then blocked this opiate pathway, the mice stayed away from the sugar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers found the same neural mechanism in humans when studying donated brain tissue and scanning the brains of volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cecad.uni-koeln.de/research/principal-investigators/full-members/henning-fenselau"&gt;Henning Fenselau&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study authors, says this suggests that people's brains evolved to love sugar in excess. "Because sugar is so easy to metabolize, its consumption beyond energy needs is favorable for animals," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the team hopes this research can lead to a better understanding of sugar overconsumption, obesity and more sophisticated weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want us to cover more neuroscience on the show?

Then doctors said it was long Covid. She was branded an antivaxxer for suggesting it could have been the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of Americans have reported similar stories. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414367/covid-vaccines-new-syndrome-biological-changes-yale.html"&gt;After the study news dropped,&lt;/a&gt; DailyMail.com spoke to dozens of Americans, including those in healthcare, law, and the military, who said they felt a sense of validation after years of being dismissed as crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a 39-year-old biology professor from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-a92d76a0-efdb-11ef-af33-b359746a4595"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; who describes himself as 'pro-vaccine' and 'pro-science', has been forced to cut his work hours after suffering extreme tremors and fatigue and partial blindness following his Moderna vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years doctors told him his symptoms were not related to the vaccine and were probably Covid itself or long Covid. The doctor, who said he used to be a 'very healthy' and outdoorsy person, can no longer hike with his wife and two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-329bef00-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-329bef01-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; including 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts have said the push to quell damaging anti-vax misinformation has left those with genuine &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13826177/fit-mum-Covid-vaccine.html"&gt;post-vaccination injuries&lt;/a&gt; treated like outcasts.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, is wheelchair bound after doctors diagnosed her with a Covid vaccine injury, she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers had just completed a triathalon (she is seen biking at left) months before passing out and becoming paralyzed. She is seen at right after her injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the small study, Yale researchers found patients with previously unknown 'post-vaccination syndrome' show distinct biological changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common symptoms appear to be brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance, a feeling of exhaustion after limited exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with the syndrome, the vaccine also appears to awaken a dormant virus known as Epstein–Barr and interfere with people's immune systems in complicated ways still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, people with the post-vaccination condition had high levels of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-be458950-efd7-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; proteins in their blood, years after taking the shot, which could leave their bodies in a permanent state of inflammation, causing a host of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress' (for example, it's not clear how common the condition is) but they highlighted a need for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers believes she has the syndrome. She was at peak physical performance when she received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, she was reliant on a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed the symptoms as anxiety and prescribed antidepressants, but Mrs Ayers told DailyMail.com  her condition soon started 'rapidly declining.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her regular 10-mile runs and 20-mile bike rides quickly dwindled, and she suffered muscle tears, including in her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an art class, Mrs Ayers passed out. She said: 'I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. I've been in a wheelchair ever since.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a year and a half, doctors assumed she had long Covid due to elevated levels of spike proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured at left before the injury and at right after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, 43, from Montana, told DailyMail.com she developed low platelets and red spots after her Pfizer shot in 2021. She was later diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and Evans syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms - fatigue, brain fog - by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until 2023, two years after receiving the vaccine, that doctors at the Veteran's Affairs and Stanford University diagnosed Mrs Ayers with 'chronic fatigue' from the vaccine residuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers was also positive for reactivated Epstein-Barr syndrome, much like the patients in the Yale study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Doctors told me there's nothing else they can do for me and to just rest. They would say stuff like "You could die in seven months, or you could live the rest of your life like this. We don't know what's going to happen to you. We don't know what's wrong with you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers spent another eight months bedbound and unable to speak, and her husband, who is also a Coast Guard veteran, had to take leave to care for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I get these crashes where if I try to take care of myself, my body shuts down and I'm in so much pain. I can't even lift my arms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Ayers has seen slight improvements, such as being able to sit up, she worries about being taken seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not an anti-vaccine person. I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not.

For the sake of my wife's career, it was something I was willing to do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-one almost immediately felt as if he gained 'Spidey Senses' after his second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Snowden said: 'Lights were brighter. I could hear things across the room that I normally couldn't hear. Everything was more vivid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he developed 'frequencies' in his ear, which he compares to fax machine sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed Mr Snowden's symptoms until 2023, when he suddenly developed an irregular heartbeat that made him feel like he was having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers also has non-cancerous but unexplained lesions on her brain, which she believes are from the vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers, pictured here, said: 'We're just left here to rot.

We're just left here to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I can't bend down and stand up without feeling like I'm losing a grip on consciousness. It literally feels like sometimes my brain is being starved of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can't walk up and down stairs without actually grabbing onto the banister because at any time I might get a dizzy spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just never know what's going to happen. I'm scared to be left home alone. You just resign yourself to the fact that your days are numbered.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dr Keyer's case, the Minnesota professor received his Moderna shot in 2021 and he says it triggered a cascade of health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He battled with extreme fatigue and weakness for a year. In March 2022, Dr Keyler developed blood clots in his right kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2022, doctors diagnosed Dr Keyler with rhabdomyolysis - a breakdown of muscle tissue that causes the release of a protein called myoglobin, which gets filtered through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can break down kidney cells and damage the organs. In half of rhabdomyolysis cases, people experience kidney complications similar to Dr Keyler's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor also developed cataracts - a condition that normally affects elderly people but can also develop due to kidney damage. Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine victims left disabled after taking Covid jab react to bombshell Yale study that found shots cause extr - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a new Yale University study identified a debilitating syndrome linked to Covid vaccines, Lindy Ayers breathed a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 31-year-old Army veteran, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-9e389f20-efd8-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, has been wheelchair-bound since she took her second Pfizer shot in 2021 as part of the government's military mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years she was told her extreme fatigue, sickness and heart palpitations were anxiety. Then doctors said it was long Covid. She was branded an antivaxxer for suggesting it could have been the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of Americans have reported similar stories. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414367/covid-vaccines-new-syndrome-biological-changes-yale.html"&gt;After the study news dropped,&lt;/a&gt; DailyMail.com spoke to dozens of Americans, including those in healthcare, law, and the military, who said they felt a sense of validation after years of being dismissed as crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a 39-year-old biology professor from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-a92d76a0-efdb-11ef-af33-b359746a4595"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; who describes himself as 'pro-vaccine' and 'pro-science', has been forced to cut his work hours after suffering extreme tremors and fatigue and partial blindness following his Moderna vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years doctors told him his symptoms were not related to the vaccine and were probably Covid itself or long Covid. The doctor, who said he used to be a 'very healthy' and outdoorsy person, can no longer hike with his wife and two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-329bef00-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-329bef01-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; including 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts have said the push to quell damaging anti-vax misinformation has left those with genuine &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13826177/fit-mum-Covid-vaccine.html"&gt;post-vaccination injuries&lt;/a&gt; treated like outcasts.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, is wheelchair bound after doctors diagnosed her with a Covid vaccine injury, she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers had just completed a triathalon (she is seen biking at left) months before passing out and becoming paralyzed. She is seen at right after her injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the small study, Yale researchers found patients with previously unknown 'post-vaccination syndrome' show distinct biological changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common symptoms appear to be brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance, a feeling of exhaustion after limited exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with the syndrome, the vaccine also appears to awaken a dormant virus known as Epstein–Barr and interfere with people's immune systems in complicated ways still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, people with the post-vaccination condition had high levels of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-be458950-efd7-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; proteins in their blood, years after taking the shot, which could leave their bodies in a permanent state of inflammation, causing a host of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress' (for example, it's not clear how common the condition is) but they highlighted a need for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers believes she has the syndrome. She was at peak physical performance when she received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, she was reliant on a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed the symptoms as anxiety and prescribed antidepressants, but Mrs Ayers told DailyMail.com  her condition soon started 'rapidly declining.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her regular 10-mile runs and 20-mile bike rides quickly dwindled, and she suffered muscle tears, including in her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an art class, Mrs Ayers passed out. She said: 'I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. I've been in a wheelchair ever since.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a year and a half, doctors assumed she had long Covid due to elevated levels of spike proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured at left before the injury and at right after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, 43, from Montana, told DailyMail.com she developed low platelets and red spots after her Pfizer shot in 2021. She was later diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and Evans syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms - fatigue, brain fog - by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until 2023, two years after receiving the vaccine, that doctors at the Veteran's Affairs and Stanford University diagnosed Mrs Ayers with 'chronic fatigue' from the vaccine residuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers was also positive for reactivated Epstein-Barr syndrome, much like the patients in the Yale study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Doctors told me there's nothing else they can do for me and to just rest. They would say stuff like "You could die in seven months, or you could live the rest of your life like this. We don't know what's going to happen to you. We don't know what's wrong with you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers spent another eight months bedbound and unable to speak, and her husband, who is also a Coast Guard veteran, had to take leave to care for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I get these crashes where if I try to take care of myself, my body shuts down and I'm in so much pain. I can't even lift my arms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Ayers has seen slight improvements, such as being able to sit up, she worries about being taken seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not an anti-vaccine person. I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not. The shots are safe and effective." They couldn't diagnose what was happening to me. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erica Evers, 42, suffered blurry vision and bleeding behind the eye after her vaccine.

Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu's potential threat to humans: Tower Health doctor describes risk level - 69News WFMZ-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxObWJWT0VieHhsTmV1TlZ1Q2JQYlJ5a1JmNzJlanFCc0s4Tjg3bUM3N0dmMERqY19QRGcwZ1pjZW5IcjdnTkxIRkZ0V3lGa3BvalVVVkF3QkdIY0hjamVyR2praE55dnNuczQ3eXZJbWNpNkV2OFdFNTRmcFMwUXFsOTIzX3g3QXpIRXRpZXhjcEJxYktLN2xBanUtX2JOYVlpRFVYSlVqVE4wY3kwbjNKUHAzZ3RILU5SMlZrLTNObzl0YVZCVmZFYTM0S2g4VWJvVHVzVVJ0Zlgxa21FZmF6Y2dsVzZqLVZ4QkZTZ1J5T01YZlN5Vy1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;BERKS COUNTY, Pa. – Bird flu, also known as avian flu, is wreaking havoc on the poultry population and the price of eggs. As of now, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the threat of a public health risk remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we're not seeing any in Pennsylvania," said Dr. Grace Kim, an infectious disease specialist with Tower Health. "As of yesterday, there were 68 human cases, and there are 69 so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said of the 69 people, most have had mild symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The avian flu is just like any mild flu, so you can have the runny nose, sore throat, cough, but what's different is the irritation of the eye," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said the people most at risk of contracting the virus are those who work closely with farm animals. She said, so far, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human spread. But she said said scientists are watching closely to make sure the virus doesn't mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where the concern is, where if that should happen, in that it can turn into an outbreak," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the best way to contain the virus is to try to minimize the spread among animals and protect yourself if you do work closely with farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Use proper protective equipment, whether they use an N95 or a mask if they have one available," she said. "If they're in the farm industry, the employee should be providing proper equipment for them to take care of farm animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Kim said people should be more worried about another flu: influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, using this avian flu as a soap box for the seasonal flu, which is horrible," she said. "And the rates, even as they are trending down this week, we are still higher than what our worst was last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The body is able to absorb nutrients from food better than supplements, so I always recommend starting with foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamins can fill the gaps if you don’t eat enough plant-based foods with vitamin C, but “mega-doses” of the nutrient won’t prevent most people from getting sick, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people who already have a vitamin C deficiency may lower their risk of getting a cold by getting plenty of the nutrient, registered dietitian Carol Johnston, Ph.D., who is an expert on vitamin C metabolism, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powerful antioxidant also protects cells from damage and is important for healthy skin, bones, teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 90 milligrams for men and 75 milligrams for women, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Children need less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe upper limit is 2,000 milligrams a day, though the nutrient doesn’t cause serious problems even at high doses, the NIH notes. The body flushes out excess vitamin C in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrus is famous for vitamin C, but other fruits deliver even more of the nutrient. Here are nine fruits highest in vitamin C:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell peppers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 yellow bell pepper, 342 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 red bell pepper, 210 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 green bell pepper, 132 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise! You may think of them as vegetables, but bell peppers are officially classified as fruits and they are vitamin C superstars, especially the yellow kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red bell peppers are one of Rizzo’s favorite &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-snack-boost-immune-system-rcna182453" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snacks to boost the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;snacks to boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; during cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re naturally low in calories and fat and provide fiber. In addition to vitamin C, they contain vitamin A, B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorful, sweet and crunchy, they can be sliced and then dipped in hummus or tzatziki for a filling snack, Rizzo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guava&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet tropical fruit contains almost double the amount of vitamin C found in an orange, plus &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/guava-benefits-rcna173418" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guava;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt; is very high in antioxidants, potassium and fiber.

It also contains a bit of iron and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineapple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians are impressed by &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pineapple-benefits-rcna152025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pineapple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt;’s high vitamin C content, especially since it helps the body absorb plant sources of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So as people are transitioning to more of a plant-based way of eating, sometimes having extra vitamin C can help your body absorb iron from foods like spinach or beans to make sure you’re not deficient in iron,” Sarah Rivenburgh, a registered dietitian at OhioHealth, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pineapple also contains insoluble fiber, or roughage, which helps to keep the bowels moving regularly; and bromelain, an enzyme that breaks down proteins and has anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 medium orange, 68 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;½ grapefruit, 45 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 small tangerines, 40 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/calories-in-an-orange-rcna57154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oranges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Oranges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/grapefruit-benefits-rcna186537" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grapefruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grapefruits&lt;/a&gt; and tangerines are a go-to source of vitamin C for many people. They’re in season in winter and spring, making them peak choices during cold and flu months. Tangerines are an especially portable, tasty, juicy, easy-to-peel snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to eat the whole fruit to get vitamin C rather than drinking the juice, Rizzo advises. You’ll get the fiber for satiety and gut health, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22190137/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pectin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pectin&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fiber found in the membranes and pith of citrus fruits that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiwi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet-tart with a distinct bright green color, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/kiwi-benefits-rcna172695" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kiwis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kiwis&lt;/a&gt; are “exceptionally high in vitamin C” and contain good amounts of fiber, potassium, vitamin E, folate and antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actinidin, a natural enzyme unique to kiwifruit breaks down protein, which helps with digestion, researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwis may even &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669584/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; because they contain serotonin, a neurotransmitter that’s involved in sleep-wake cycles, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mango&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasty, rich in vitamin C and full of soluble fiber — the type that turns into a gel in the digestive tract — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mango-benefits-rcna148830" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mango;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mango&lt;/a&gt; is also one of the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-sugar-rcna189181" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruits highest in sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruits highest in sugar&lt;/a&gt; for healthy energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian Samantha Cassetty includes mangoes on her list of the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-fruits-rcna139553" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:15 healthiest fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;15 healthiest fruits&lt;/a&gt; because of their carotenoid compounds, which give mangoes their golden color and provide health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cantaloupe-vs-honeydew-rcna163065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cantaloupe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/a&gt; is a hydrating, low-calorie fruit that’s high in both vitamin C and A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also low in sugar and high in protein for a fruit.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18072"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18073"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18074"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQY0RBMElfMWwyb28yRVQ0N2c2X1htNy1Ha3FvUXJld05ESU1GUFR6X1RybmlnMi1UZjF1UGh2YUlvQ3V3RmtYN1lnZGZpVnBpemNYVXNHc0pXZnc1TXQwdWxDZE4yQmh4alpfTC1yTTI1XzMyX2h3eHJBTE9NcHAyQ21KLTRNemlHTkgtYXBNcUMwUkp4czh0eFNNejkwd1VYWVFPMWpB</guid></item><item><title>US doctor explains how just 10 minutes of walking can increase life span - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has a deep impact on the overall well being including the longevity of an individual. Several studies have suggested the importance of daily movement for as small as just a few minutes in controlling the important parameters of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Cleveland Clinic's Senior Medical Advisor, Mark Hyman took to Instagram to share the findings of two important studies and to aware his fans and followers about the importance of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the study, the expert writes, "A study published in The Lancet followed 47,000 people over seven years and found that walking can significantly lower the risk of death. For adults 60 and older, the greatest benefits were seen at 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For adults under 60, the sweet spot was 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day. Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity. Start where you are and build from there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark’s post has received positive feedback from his followers. "Love this reminder! Every step adds up to a healthier, longer life. Time to lace up and get moving! Who’s in?," writes one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could not be agreed more! My homework to the couples is to take a short walk at least for 10 min around the block whenever you feel out of control. It is so important to remind ourselves we are humans and we are not perfect. Getting angry, triggered, and misunderstood by everyone there specifically our partner is part of life. But how we choose to respond to our own triggers and emotions is the key to have a more blanched and more satisfying life. As a couple and relationship therapist I always emphasize the importance of pause, process and precede. Taking few minutes walk not only help out with physical health but also calm our nervous system down so was can come back with clarity and calm to our partner," writes a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power walking is a faster-paced form of walking that offers enhanced health benefits compared to regular walking. By maintaining a speed of 4 to 5.5 mph, power walking boosts cardiovascular fitness, burns more calories, and strengthens muscles. It improves posture, engages the core, and enhances endurance without the impact of running. This low-impact exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and joint issues while promoting weight loss and mental well-being. Incorporating arm movements and proper posture maximizes its benefits. Power walking is an effective and accessible way to improve overall health and maintain an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does walking help boost health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of exercise. It requires no special equipment, can be done anywhere, and offers numerous health benefits. Whether it’s a brisk morning walk or a relaxed evening stroll, walking consistently can greatly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that regular walkers tend to live longer and healthier lives. Walking reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves mobility, and enhances overall quality of life, making it a key factor in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking strengthens the heart by improving circulation, reducing bad cholesterol (LDL), and increasing good cholesterol (HDL). Regular walking lowers the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, and stroke. Just 30 minutes a day can significantly improve heart health and boost overall endurance. For individuals with diabetes or those at risk, walking helps regulate blood sugar levels. A short walk after meals can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar spikes, making it an excellent habit for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is an effective way to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight. A brisk 30-minute walk can burn between 150-200 calories, depending on body weight and speed. It also helps in improving metabolism, making it easier to manage weight without the stress of intense workouts. It engages various muscles, including the legs, core, and back. It helps maintain bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, especially in nature, reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. It stimulates the release of endorphins, the body’s natural mood boosters. Walking in fresh air and green surroundings can also improve concentration, creativity, and overall mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking stimulates the immune system, helping the body fight infections. Studies suggest that people who walk regularly have a lower risk of colds, flu, and other illnesses. Walking enhances circulation, which allows immune cells to move more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking can improve sleep quality by reducing stress and balancing circadian rhythms. It helps in managing insomnia and contributes to more restful and uninterrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post-meal walk aids digestion by enhancing gut motility and reducing bloating. Walking after meals can also help prevent acid reflux and promote overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR</guid></item><item><title>8 daily exercises to reduce cholesterol levels naturally and detox our body - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise plays a vital role in managing cholesterol by increasing HDL (good cholesterol) and lowering LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, helps improve heart health by promoting better blood circulation and reducing plaque buildup in arteries. Strength training also contributes to overall metabolic health. Exercise aids in weight management, reducing the risk of obesity-related high cholesterol. It enhances insulin sensitivity, lowering the risk of diabetes, which is linked to cholesterol imbalance. For optimal benefits, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise weekly.(Images: Canva)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Weight Loss: Semaglutide Could Curb Alcohol Cravings According to USC Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 03:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk</guid></item><item><title>Eye health, long covid and a stress hormone: The week in Well+Being - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxORzlSdGZTanNybnVDbGVRZThZU0NJdWlhaXY5U1NoU0EtdWFIN05pQnpSVHVBa21UQjNUdEtGR1lfc1EwYlpWZU5GNC12dTVoZ1lPV2JHcC1xQV94S20xLUU2QmY2STJsTXhVWWd1dmUycm5JR1Z6by0zN3FQVUkyaHZFd1U3dEdzR2I4TTJJVEE4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OP5HZZJNUVBLXNQQPFY7DOWAWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NILWTAX5FBRPNG26ZWJFVBC6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Happy Thursday!

The cancer vaccine was personalized for each participant to target specific proteins found in their form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also received an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunotherapy drug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immunotherapy drug&lt;/a&gt; (atezolizumab) and standard-of-care chemotherapy after receiving surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic cancer vaccines like this one, referred to as autogene cevumeran, are meant to treat the cancer instead of preventing it, by training the immune system to "recognize cancer cells as foreign," according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Patients who had an immune response to the vaccine were more likely to have reduced cancer risk by their three-year check-up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is meant to target early stages of cancer that have not spread, where tumors can be surgically removed, to "help delay or prevent recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran noted that this approach could potentially be applied to other forms of cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For patients with pancreatic cancer, our latest results continue to support the approach of using personalized mRNA vaccines to target neoantigens in each patient’s tumor," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can do this in pancreatic cancer, theoretically you may be able to develop therapeutic vaccines for other cancer types."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers, as only about 13% of patients are alive five years following diagnosis, according to MSK and the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Common therapies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Common therapies&lt;/a&gt;

It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was a shock," Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Jace's surgery was quick and "pretty easy", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;His son's progress has been "pretty amazing", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision," Brendan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;No other options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp" alt="Moorfields Hospital Jace and his mum DJ having their photo taken in London on a sunny day with blue skies, with Tower Bridge in the background" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Moorfields Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Jace came to London with his parents for the experimental gene therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;'Hugely impressive'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give "compelling evidence" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: "The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the "greatest benefit" and ultimately transform children's lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:19:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9WZElYeVFfdkk2aUtCMmV3RDRGNUxuVGhDWlZGVVdXV1pTTk5XS1gyNlExdi1zOGhOTWduUWFmdTNiRlRBbmJHaVB6ZXB1dHVLTnd2NTZHczV1UdIBX0FVX3lxTE10RHZ1em1aTGxVLWV4M2x1dFdPTG5VXzIxcFdCSzBoeWVtdHlya04zWTlnTDdnTWhSVzFvM1N0RWY4UC0yeTVYblJOZklyQW5LXzF5dUxtQ3ZrcVIwcmU4</guid></item><item><title>Sweet Little Aussie Mix Gets Whacked with Brother’s ‘Helicopter Tail’ and Loves Every Second -

When you're that little, everything your sibling does seems so awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Tuesday, February 18th, one sweet little Australian Shepherd mix puppy was enjoying some coach time with his older brother when he started getting the "helicopter tail" treatment. Honestly, he deserves some credit for his patience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thetakpak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Tak Pak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Tak Pak&lt;/a&gt; is 6 rescue dogs and 2 rescue cats strong, plus they're always fostering other pups! The little Aussie/Pit cross in this video is one of those fosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The puppy came to his foster home with four of his siblings, and they were all suffering from Parvovirus when they got there. As it happens, though, they were ready for their forever homes just a few days before Valentine's Day! All five pups are named after different chocolates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though we're not sure exactly which pup is in this video, based on another video introducing them all a few days before this one, it looks like Snickers! As you can see, he's super chill with other dogs and doesn't mind a helicopter tail or two; if you've got easily-excited dogs, he could be right for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you'd like to adopt any of the chocolate pups, including him, you can do so from &lt;a href="http://www.coldnosewarmheart.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dogs Can Live Happy Lives After Parvo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All five of the Chocolate pups struggled with Parvovirus when they first got to their foster home, and with consistent treatment and lots of love, all five of them managed to beat the illness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parvovirus is a &lt;a href="https://hartforanimals.org/pet-health-blog/2a6egbxl82yddlm-3hzfr-k4lcl-3mzd7-zn452" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:very scary thing;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;very scary thing; &lt;/a&gt;it's one of the first things puppies get vaccinated for when they're born. Parvovirus keeps a dog from being able to properly absorb nutrients; the virus attacks white blood cells and the gastrointestinal tract.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MICHIGAN, USA — Two cats that belonged to Michigan dairy workers died after &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/bird-avian-flu-cdc-detected-cases-veterinarians-cattle/507-26a6f9ab-3183-4950-81e1-064fd699f09b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cats-dogs-bird-flu-pets-raw-food-7a57b3047164676a7d237bcd05a5b9db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;being infected&lt;/a&gt; with bird flu. But it's still not clear how the animals got sick or whether they spread the virus to people in the household, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm?s_cid=mm7405a2_w"&gt;a new study shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary experts said the report, published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lacks detail that could confirm whether people can spread the virus to domestic cats — or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don't think there is any way of concluding that there was human-to-cat transmission based on the data that is presented,” said Dr. Diego Diel of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats in two separate households died in May after developing severe illnesses that were confirmed as the Type A H5N1 bird virus found in U.S. dairy herds, investigators reported. Both were indoor-only cats that had no exposure to infected cattle or birds and didn't consume raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cat that died belonged to a worker on a dairy farm in a county known to have bird flu-infected cattle. The worker reported symptoms of illness before the cat got sick. That cat fell ill, tested positive for H5N1 and had to be euthanized. A second cat in that household also got sick, but it recovered. A third cat in the household didn't get sick and tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an adolescent in the household got sick but tested negative for flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other cat that died lived in a different household. That pet belonged to a dairy worker who transported raw milk and reported frequent splashes of milk on the face, eyes and clothing. That worker reported eye irritation, a possible symptom of bird flu, two days before the cat got sick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cat was known to roll in the worker's dirty clothing and died within a day of developing signs of infection, the study authors wrote. Another cat in that household tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the dairy workers declined to be tested for H5N1, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means it's impossible to know whether they directly transmitted the virus to their cats, said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. It's more likely that the cats were infected by virus on the workers' clothing, boots or hands, he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that people at this point are not shedding large amounts of virus,” he said. “I don't think it's because this person coughed on their cat.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that reports of bird flu infections in indoor cats are rare, but “such cats might pose a risk for human infection.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months since the cats died, there have been several reports of domestic cats becoming infected and dying after &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/raw-milk-california-cats-bird-flu-c3f6201216efb2a7e98ca143329a631a"&gt;consuming unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cats-raw-pet-food-10e7b3bcaffe92ab84cadcbcab1f09c6"&gt;pet food&lt;/a&gt; contaminated with bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report underscores the need for more comprehensive testing for H5N1 in all arenas, Poulsen said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

It is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, and can be deadly even in small doses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/11/15/deas-third-annual-national-family-summit-fentanyl-highlights-progress" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that the potency of fentanyl pills agents have been seizing was decreasing, which may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As the drug supply has become more saturated with fentanyl, good drug supply may be becoming more stable, and people may be just developing a tolerance for fentanyl," Cerdá said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report found that West Virginia was the state with the highest rate at 81.9 deaths per 100,000 while Nebraska had the lowest rate at 9.0 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, between 2022 and 2023, rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in 20 states and did not change significantly in 25 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, over that same period, increases were seen in six states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cerdá said one hypothesis is that the increase in overdose death rates in western states may be due to shifts in the drug market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We saw that the penetration of fentanyl really started in the East Coast," she said. "Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said. "And we should invest resources and trying to figure out why the decrease is happening, and how can we learn, particularly from those states that are experiencing this decrease to proactively respond to those states which are currently experiencing an increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:19:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2d9IBowFBVV95cUxQYTNOLUpkTGhCVWlNNnhuZHc5eFZmYU5IaXdnNkd0blVNcGpDa001WEN1TFpveWs4U2hhVFR0UjhwMTV5UC1DbmszNUtwOFZUcWJPQ2JjaVhldTBFY2tFYkFNUGJaWVN0YkNfZVZ4UEU2X3djUjF4cTBURjh0bFd6cGNRdGI2X2pYN2JqaWVuRUMtYWJ5UE5OdXVtYlJmTjE0QUhN</guid></item><item><title>Nine-year-old girl from Alden fighting for her life after testing positive for the flu - WKBW 7 News Buffalo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQOG13TngwbC1kbWEyRlVCMExNd1p1VTJFeXczZGZvcXU4TW1pWGtpVXVESG1IalkzVGZTS3I3LVJPZzJISHJfVnJTem5jRGx3RFc4NlpEMjJIWDc0d1U0SzJ1SHQwVHBDVDlseWNiOVRFbVpzT1hab1R5ZHhXaW9HZzY4WHFpLTJzS1d0SXRBTW9fR0ZieWxxTWxnMUxwYV95WWtydnZiX1ZtR05rMXRZeVdhaFkxUUkzcHhXd3dSVUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y. (WKBW) — Nine-year-old Mia Klyczek is fighting for her life at Oishei Children's Hospital after testing positive for flu B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klyczek went to the ER during the early morning hours of February 19, after a slight fever and vomiting. According to a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; set up for Mia, the nine-year-old had a seizure and was sedated with a breathing tube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family said doctors believe flu B has caused severe swelling and bleeding in the brain, along with heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is asking for prayers for their girl, hoping for a miracle. On Thursday morning Mia's mother Christina wrote the following on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We were told by the neurologists this morning that the swelling in her brain is severe.

The findings could lead to better therapies for those affected by aging, cancer, and muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this research is an enzyme called GCN5, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural proteins of skeletal muscles. These muscles control essential functions such as breathing, posture, and movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://rupress.org/jcb/article/221/2/e202104022/212962/GCN5-maintains-muscle-integrity-by-acetylating-YY1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, highlights how losing GCN5 weakens muscle resilience under physical stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keir Menzies, a molecular biologist at uOttawa and the study’s senior author, emphasized the enzyme’s importance. “We found that if you delete GCN5 expression from muscle, it will no longer be able to handle extreme physical stress,” he explained. His team spent five years unraveling the enzyme’s impact on muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, researchers created genetically modified mice that lacked GCN5 in their muscles. This allowed them to observe how the enzyme affects cellular processes like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation. Without it, the muscles showed a steep decline in function, particularly under physical strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The structure of striated, or skeletal, muscle.

This type of movement typically causes tiny muscle tears, which trigger growth and repair. But without GCN5, the muscles failed to recover, instead breaking down in a way that mimicked the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type mice, which retained normal GCN5 levels, handled the same exercise without issue. Their muscles adapted and repaired as expected. The stark contrast between the two groups underscored GCN5’s essential role in muscle resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Menzies, these findings reflect what is seen in advanced aging and diseases like muscular dystrophy, where muscles progressively weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was further supported by human data, which showed a negative correlation between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-approach-for-boosting-muscle-growth-during-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle fiber diameter&lt;/a&gt; and a multifunctional protein called Yin Yang 1. This protein, which plays a role in various cellular functions, was identified as a target of GCN5 in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant takeaway from the study was that GCN5 is responsible for promoting the production of key muscle proteins, particularly dystrophin. Dystrophin is the primary protein that maintains the integrity of muscle cells by acting as an anchor and shock absorber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767260/#:~:text=Dystrophin%20is%20a%20rod%20shape,two%20subunits%2C%20%CE%B1%20and%20%CE%B2." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dystrophin&lt;/a&gt;, muscles become highly vulnerable to damage, leading to severe health consequences. Dr. Menzies emphasized, “Our publication shows that if you knock out GCN5, the one major thing we see is a lack of dystrophin, without seeing any real disruption of any other mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also confirmed that removing GCN5 doesn’t affect the mitochondria—the part of the cell responsible for producing energy—indicating that GCN5’s role in muscle health is more structural than metabolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build upon previous research demonstrating the importance of dystrophin in maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/just-3-seconds-of-daily-exercise-can-significantly-improve-muscle-strength-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health and integrity&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Menzies suggests that understanding GCN5’s function could help in the development of therapies for muscle degeneration in diseases like muscular dystrophy, as well as conditions related to aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber within the muscle cells, reducing any damage caused by muscle contractions.

When these nerves are damaged, they can’t trigger the muscle contractions that are needed to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/surprising-muscle-significantly-increases-metabolism-and-burns-fat-while-sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stimulate muscle activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your muscles don’t contract, your body thinks you don’t need them anymore.

&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth’s emergency department in Bellingham was overwhelmed by patients this week, forcing hours-long waits and the hospital to cancel some elective procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Close to 50 patients were waiting in the emergency room lobby on Tuesday, Feb. 18, with some patients waiting up to eight hours in the lobby before being seen and treated in the emergency department, according to a PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It “was a record for total number of patients in the department and total in the lobby waiting,” stated an internal hospital message sent on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, there were more than 100 patients either in the emergency department lobby or being treated, according to the source, an emergency department employee who was granted confidentiality by Cascadia Daily News due to fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We had a patient in their 90s wait seven hours,” the employee said. “We had patients with chest pain waiting for hours to be seen, and patients in a crowded environment positive with the flu. It wasn’t a good situation at all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth was not immediately able to verify numbers provided to CDN, but did confirm that the hospital was “routinely seeing much higher daily” emergency department numbers than usual in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The facility reported “unprecedented patient volumes” in the department due to rising cases of RSV, flu and other emergent health needs, according to a Feb. 19 news release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hospital urged those with non-emergency health issues to seek medical care elsewhere. These options include primary care providers, urgent care clinics and PeaceHealth’s priority care clinics, which offer same-day, drop-in care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please know that we treat everyone who visits our Emergency Department, but those with non-emergency needs will most likely have a longer wait time before we are able to care for them,” said Dr. James Scribner, medical director at PeaceHealth St. Joseph’s Emergency Department.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some elective procedures at the hospital were canceled Wednesday morning. A voicemail left with a patient and shared with CDN stated that “the hospital is full to capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient, Rebecca Youlin, was told to contact her surgeon’s office to reschedule a biopsy procedure she started planning in November. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youlin was able to reschedule for early March. But, she noted that if the biopsy eventually revealed any concerns, such as cancerous cells, she would be two weeks farther behind fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While scheduled to be a patient on Wednesday, Youlin is also an ICU nurse at PeaceHealth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This whole week has been insane,” she said, noting that she was concerned that the hospital was at capacity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Being at capacity] basically means that if you are sick enough to need a bed in the hospital, you may end up being boarded in the ER until a bed becomes available,” said Youlin, who has been a registered nurse for 15 years. “Believe me, when you are sick enough to be admitted, the ER is the least conducive environment to healing!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The confidential source at PeaceHealth told CDN that it has become common for part of the hospital’s emergency department to be partially filled with these “boarders” — patients who have been admitted but are awaiting a bed on a different floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Youlin recognized that the nation is facing a &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus"&gt;particularly bad flu season&lt;/a&gt;, she said the community has outgrown the medical facility. This is, in some ways, illustrated by how often a “code white” is declared at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A code white from the emergency room is essentially letting staff know they need to get all the patients that have admission orders to their rooms to make space for new patients, Youlin explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These code whites are being called on a daily basis, she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone is “inundated and slammed,” Youlin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth did not respond to a question about the number of code whites called at the facility so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “We are asking the community to consider other care options for non-emergency healthcare needs so our team can care for the most ill and vulnerable,” Dr. Scribner stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scribner encouraged anyone with difficulty breathing to come to the ER for an evaluation. He added that for other flu or respiratory virus symptoms, like body aches and coughing, self-care or a visit to a primary care physician or same-day clinic may be a more suitable option.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not expected. He was a very healthy middle aged male harbor seal," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said he is one of three animals there have died from Avian flu in the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a bird that tested positive, and we had a wild black vulture that tested positive" said Rapoza. "But Blue was the first mammal that tested positive here on site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Blue's death has been hard for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born at the zoo 21 years ago, an animal ambassador that educated people about seals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue  started on Feb. 1, when one of his keepers noticed he wasn't eating, which wasn't unusual, but noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next day he was showing some symptoms that seemed to be GI related, or stomach related," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue was treated and monitored, but he wasn't getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next step was potentially going to be a Cat scan," said Rapoza. "Unfortunately, on the morning of the fifth, which was the fifth day, the keeper came in to find that he had passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an initial swab testing for Blue that came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recommendation from the Lincoln Park Zoo, which also recently lost a harbor seal to the Avian flu, resulted in a positive test from the National Vet Services Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luna and Conway, two female harbor seals, shared the habitat with Blue. They were separated from him as soon as he started to show symptoms. Rapoza said the zoo is constantly monitoring the girls' health, and doing everything they can to mitigate further risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harbor seal habitat is an open enclosure, but Rapoza said birds rarely enter the space, so it is not clear how Blue came in contact with a wild bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood Park Zoo and Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence told NBC 10 they are ramping up biosecurity measures to combat the Avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures include more footbaths at exhibits, and personal protective equipment for zookeepers, removing duck feeders, disinfecting and more actions to avoid cross contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbor seal exhibit zookeeper Amanda Jacobson showed NBC 10 the mixture used for the footbaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different areas that are different risk levels,  and just by doing this anywhere we can, it will minimize that risk," said Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim Wojick with Roger Williams Park Zoo acknowledged that Avian flu concerns are only getting worse, but there are things everyone can do to prevent the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be something that we thought about, but didn't have to deal with," said Wojick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it's here and it's widespread, we're now living in that reality where when we potentially make new exhibits, we're going to be looking at ways we can design those exhibits to keep our animals as safe as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Williams Park Zoo moved animals like its eagles from their open habitat to an enclosed space for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood is testing all of its birds, monitoring the health of all of its animals, and educating the public on how to avoid spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've weathered the storm through West Nile, Triple E, COVID," said Rapoza. "Our guests do not have direct contact with our animals and so there is no risk to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapoza reminds that people not to feed wild birds, keep pets away from dead birds, and call animal control or DEM to assist with birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk has been lower to humans but there still have been human cases so don't touch anything without personal protective equipment," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro said it is monitoring for bird flu and will report suspicious bird deaths to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keepers say they are not doing anything out of the ordinary, because they don’t have many waterfowl in their zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Turn to 10</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Drug overdose deaths fall in 2023 for 1st time since pandemic began: CDC - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in the United States for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to new federal data published early Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The rate of overdose deaths fell from 32.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2022 to 31.3 per 100,000 people in 2023, a 4% decrease, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/drug-overdose/drug-overdose-2022-2023.htm#table" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Aitzaz Munir, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and associate program director for the Rutgers Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program, told ABC News the drop in the overdose death rate was "surprising" to him but a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said he believes the decrease in deaths may be due to a more "aggressive approach" toward the treatment of drug conditions including more treatment programs and making them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This includes making &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/overdose-reversal-drug-narcan-buy-counter-starting-september/story?id=102671170" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, more widely available&lt;/a&gt; and increasing the availability of drug checking supplies, including fentanyl test strips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, there might be a better response in places where these treatments are available and patients are getting those treatments," he said.

"Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said.

The cat was brought to a local vet and then the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center, which has advanced treatments available. But due to "rapid disease progression," the cat was euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been reported on some Michigan dairy farms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by that time, and the cat's owner worked on a dairy farm, although not directly with the animals. The sick cat's body was submitted for further testing after euthanization, and swabs from the cat's brain and nose came back positive for H5N1. The virus samples from the cat matched the viruses circulating in local cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery prompted a broader investigation, in which officials found that another indoor cat in the household developed potential bird flu symptoms after the first cat did. These symptoms included decreased appetite and watery eye discharge, but the cat ultimately recovered without specific treatment. No specimens from the second cat were tested for H5N1, but the timing of illness may point to possible transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the dairy worker declined to be tested for bird flu, they did report experiencing vomiting and diarrhea a day before the first cat got sick. The three other members of the worker's household tested negative for influenza A, the broad group of viruses H5N1 belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the picture, one person in the household — a teenager who'd had "regular contact" with the sick cat — got sick about six days after the cat did. Their symptoms included cough, sore throat, headache and muscle aches. However, the teen tested negative for flu and instead came back positive on a test that looks for other common viruses, such as common-cold viruses. So while the timing of the teen's infection could be worrisome, based on these test results, it may be that the individual had a run-of-the-mill respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time frame in a different Michigan household, a second indoor cat came down with bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6-month-old male, that cat was also an exclusively indoor pet. The owner brought the cat into the MSU clinic after it showed one day of "progressive neurologic deterioration," facial swelling and stopped eating. The cat died within 24 hours of these symptoms emerging. Nasal swabs from the cat were positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat's owner, a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized (raw) milk from various farms, declined testing for bird flu. The worker had a "fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk," the MMWR notes. However, the worker did report having notable eye irritation two days before the cat got sick. (Recent H5N1 infections in humans have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;often involved eye symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, namely conjunctivitis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worker also reported having not worn protective equipment when handling raw milk and frequently experiencing "splash exposures" to the face, eyes and clothing while working. The cat that got infected and died frequently rolled in the owner's clothes, whereas a second cat in the household that didn't get sick did not exhibit that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because neither dairy worker received testing for A(H5), whether cat 1A's owner's gastrointestinal symptoms or cat 2A's owner's ocular symptoms were because of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or a different etiology [cause] is unknown," the MMWR says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, a data table included in the new MMWR was actually published earlier in the month, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 6. This seems to have been accidental, as the table was promptly taken down. (Live Science has asked the CDC to confirm whether this data table is the same one that was taken down, but based on that previous news story, the data appears the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Times report, in early February, the data table had briefly appeared in a report that otherwise focused on air quality and the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles County wildfires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Times reported. Prior to the wildfire report's release, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pause had been placed on external communications from federal health agencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the CDC's MMWR, which had been published every week for decades. At the time, experts expressed concern that the data were potentially being withheld for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y-Cjss3gj579YRvtxSx1rw9dH0PcJsRDqo" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y-Cjss3gj579YRvtxSx1rw9dH0PcJsRDqo slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or veterinary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four young children have gained life-changing improvements in sight following treatment with a pioneering new genetic medicine through UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, with the support of MeiraGTx.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The children were born with a severe impairment to their sight due to a rare genetic deficiency that affects the AIPL1 gene. The condition, a form of retinal dystrophy, means those affected are born with only sufficient sight to distinguish between light and darkness. The gene defect causes the retinal cells to malfunction and die, with children affected being legally certified as blind from birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new treatment is designed to enable the retinal cells to work better and to survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, developed by UCL scientists, consists of injecting healthy copies of the gene into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery. These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, so they can penetrate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal cells&lt;/a&gt; and replace the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/defective+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;defective gene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition is very rare, and the first children identified were from overseas. To mitigate any potential safety issues, the first four children received this novel therapy in one eye only. All four saw remarkable improvements in the treated eye over the following three to four years, but lost sight in their untreated eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of the new treatment, reported in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, show that gene therapy at an early age can dramatically improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt; for children with this condition—one that is rare and particularly severe. Successful gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness (RPE65 deficiency) has been available on the NHS since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;These new findings offer hope that children affected by both rare and more common forms of genetic blindness may in time also benefit from genetic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now exploring the means to make this new treatment more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor James Bainbridge, professor of retinal studies at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said, "Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Michel Michaelides, professor of ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, commented, "We have, for the first time, an effective treatment for the most severe form of childhood blindness, and a potential paradigm shift to treatment at the earliest stages of the disease. The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; to change lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure to administer the treatment to the affected children took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The children were assessed in the NIHR Moorfields Clinical Research Facility, and the NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Center provided infrastructure for the research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIVERSIDE, Calif. — Four black rats in Riverside County tested positive for Bird Flu. It is the first time the H5N1 virus has been found in rats.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture &lt;/a&gt;(USDA), health officials found the four rats over the course of three days, from January 29, 2025, through January 31.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the USDA found the virus spreading to other animals, including domestic cats. In January, two house cats in the Bay Area tested positive for Bird Flu, and two tested positive in Los Angeles. Health officials in Oregon and Montana also found the virus had spread to domestic cats last month.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, the virus has also spread to marine life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 5, a harbor seal in Bristol, Massachusetts, tested positive for bird flu, and two bottlenose dolphins in Florida were also found to, also found to be infected. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild birds typically spread bird flu, and it is highly contagious, most often fatal in birds. In recent years, the virus has infected mammals as well as humans. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March 2024 through December 2024, health officials have confirmed 61 cases of bird flu in humans, 34 of which were in California. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has also had a major impact on poultry farms and has resulted in an increase in the price of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the outbreak began in 2022, the bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus. This has driven egg prices up to a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/egg-prices-record-bird-flu-a2394bdefc7bd0514d4f003cc5e8a908" target="_blank"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; of $4.95 per dozen on average. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Essentially, kidney stones are hard deposits made up of minerals and salts that form in your kidneys. If you’ve never had one, count your blessings. If you have, then you already know you'd do just about anything to avoid another visit from these sinister stones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, while there’s no magic spell to guarantee you’ll be kidney-stone-free for life, there are a few lifestyle changes and dietary tweaks that might tip the odds in your favor. Enter the latest research finding: data published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;suggests that increasing niacin intake might help reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This article will take a closer look at the details of this new research and explore what it means for you. By understanding these findings, you’ll gain insight into how you may have one more tool in the arsenal against those pebble-sized pains in the back.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kidney stones are a common issue, affecting around 11% of certain populations in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an important nutrient that the body needs to function properly. However, while niacin plays many crucial roles in the body, it is unclear if this nutrient impacts kidney stone risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at data from a large health survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that took place from 2007 to 2018. Researchers evaluated what people ate over a 24-hour period to learn how much niacin they were consuming. They also asked participants if they had a history of kidney stones through a questionnaire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To study the potential link between niacin intake and kidney stones, they used advanced statistical methods to analyze the data. The study included a total of 28,508 participants, making it a thorough investigation into whether niacin in your diet might affect kidney stone risk. The average age of the participants was a little over 47 years old. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After analyzing the data, researchers found that people who experience kidney stones often share certain characteristics. They are more likely to be men, older, white, have higher household incomes, smoke, exercise more and have a history of conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. Interestingly, they also tend to consume less niacin through their diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing those who ate the least niacin with those who ate the most, the latter group had about 22% lower chances of getting kidney stones. This benefit was particularly noticeable in people under the age of 60. Scientists also observed that the connection between niacin and kidney stone risk wasn't entirely straightforward—it followed an "L-shaped" pattern, showing that even a modest increase in niacin intake seemed to help reduce the risk. These findings suggest that including more niacin-rich foods in your diet may make a difference in kidney stone risk reduction, especially for younger adults.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The author of this study suggests that while the reason why niacin may impact kidney stones remains unclear, one possible reason is because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Kidney stones often form from calcium crystals in a process that involves inflammation and oxidative stress, a condition where potentially harmful molecules, known as reactive oxygen species, may damage cells. Niacin has antioxidant properties that help fight these effects. Niacin may also support the health of mitochondria, the energy producers in cells, which may help prevent crystal buildup in the kidneys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few important limits to consider in the study. First, since it was cross-sectional, it means we can't say for sure that eating more or less niacin is what causes changes in kidney stone risk. Cross-sectional studies capture data at a single point in time, making it difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, the researchers relied on participants to report their dietary habits and kidney stone history through questionnaires, so there's always a chance that some details were misremembered. Also, certain specifics, like the exact makeup of the kidney stones, weren't included in the database used. Lastly, eating habits can change over time, and since dietary information was recorded from 24-hour recalls, it might not represent long-term patterns. Despite these challenges, this study sheds light on how diet might help prevent kidney stones, but future studies are needed to further confirm these findings and understand the role of niacin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply To Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who has experienced kidney stones (or you’d just like to avoid them), the findings of this study offer an intriguing slice of hope. It seems that niacin intake may play a role in reducing your risk of these painful deposits. While it’s not an excuse to go and raid your local supplement aisle just yet, it might be a good time to look at how much niacin you’re getting in your daily diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, it's not quite as simple as just sprinkling niacin over your dinner and declaring yourself invincible. Kidney stones can be caused by many factors—hydration levels, genetics and underlying health conditions can all influence your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This research doesn't eliminate any of those factors, but it does suggest that niacin might be one part of a bigger puzzle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s important to approach it with realistic expectations. You don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight or start obsessing over niacin levels. Small, thoughtful adjustments, like prioritizing foods rich in this nutrient while keeping up with other healthy habits, may make a meaningful difference over time. After all, when the alternative is potentially passing a kidney stone, any edge you can get is worth considering, right? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some foods to focus on if you are trying to increase your niacin intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other common sources of niacin include brown rice and salmon—so a simple rice bowl like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-salmon-rice-bowl-8628232" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Crispy Salmon Rice Bowl&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to add some niacin to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And though it seems like a simple solution, we wouldn’t recommend you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;take a niacin supplement&lt;/a&gt; without consulting with your healthcare provider. It’s always a good idea to speak with your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the science linking niacin intake to a reduced risk of kidney stones is still evolving, this research in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; holds promise for anyone hoping to steer clear of these notorious nuisances. Incorporating niacin-rich foods into your diet might just be another step toward keeping your kidneys happy and healthy. But remember, no single nutrient is a cure-all. A balanced diet, proper hydration, and an awareness of individual risk factors are all essential pieces of the puzzle. And when it comes to kidney stones, it’s always better to prevent than to pass, right?

Inflammation in her body went down, her appetite was quelled, and she lost five pounds in the first week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later her doctor increased her dosage to 1.7mg, standard procedure when the patient is acclimating well and could benefit from a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Burgess began experiencing debilitating side effects, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;nausea and severe&lt;/a&gt; stomach pain. She was vomiting and had occasional diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess' goal was to lose 50 lbs with the help of Ozempic. Since starting it in 2023, she has lost 60lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized this is not okay. This is not how I wanted to lose weight,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when she and her doctor discussed microdosing the drug - or taking less than the 0.25 mg starter dose, which she had tolerated with no side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, Ms Burgess has lost 60 lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many people have personalized their treatment to microdose, but for Ms Burgess it was a life-changing hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dosages of Ozempic and similar drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, are meant to be increased very gradually, roughly every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katie Sorensen, a nurse practitioner specializing in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, who was not involved in Burgess’ treatment, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-microdosing-on-ozempic"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microdosing regimen has not been approved by the FDA, in part because ‘we would not be able to say for certain that a patient is reaping the full potential benefits of GLP-1 medications that have been shown in recent clinical trials,’ according to Ms Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If individuals experience weight loss with small doses, it could be because they are what scientists refer to as ‘super responders.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This term describes a specific group of people who achieve significant weight loss rapidly when taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have shown most people need to remain on semaglutide or a similar drug indefinitely in order to keep the weight off, it's not clear if those rules apply to a microdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But research into the drug's long-term effects is beginning to suggest that, regardless of dosage, a person must keep taking it because, while it suppresses appetite, it doesn't permanently alter the metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison did not disclose the dosage she is currently taking, but she has not experienced any adverse side effects in the two years she’s been microdosing Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her appetite is back, but the food noise has abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s been absolutely great.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess began microdosing Ozempic when a higher dose made her sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, dropping 18% of their weight over 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12 percent of their original body weight in the year after dropping the weekly shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeing those first five pounds melt away motivated Ms Burgess to get the most out of her medication. Determined not to let her weight loss stall after lowering her dose, she also prioritized eating more fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘You can’t think you can get on a GLP-1 medication and it’s going to completely change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just a tool. You need to create sustainable healthy habits to progress in the long run, especially if you eventually get off it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who stop taking the medications do regain some or all of the weight they lost and some people end up weighing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study last autumn found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - regained about two-thirds of the weight loss and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 12 percent of US adults report having ever used Ozempic or another similar medication for weight loss, while six percent indicated they were currently using the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 percent of people who had recently started medications like Ozempic discontinued use within two years, and 71 percent stopped within the first year, either because they had reached their goal weight or because the drugs were too expensive - with a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots have also been shown to raise the risk of life-altering and even deadly effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised concerns about popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic potentially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;leading to blindness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has connected these injections to conditions that trigger inflammation and restrict blood flow to the eye, resulting in severe and sometimes irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicines have also been shown to cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles don't function properly, leading to delayed emptying of food into the small intestine, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13813961/Ozempic-triggered-deadly-effect-forced-ORGAN-removed-robbed-basic-human-function.html"&gt;and ischemic colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where reduced blood flow to the colon causes inflammation and injury to the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year also revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13816987/deaths-linked-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-analysis.html"&gt;at least 160 people&lt;/a&gt; have died while taking Ozempic. None of the deaths are proven to have been directly caused by the injections, but experts say the reports indicate cases where they're suspected to have played a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:35:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQb2tBNGpRVVluZ0ZVVEJaMTlfZU9naURSYUREbHFJZEZvdmpmOEs1cmprdFI1bERvN1NiSno3RDQwUm1PQ3NFXzdnQzhoNllfTzVCYTd4dWp3aVRUQ1ZzS2g1TFFxc2I4WTNPcnRuTmNCTlZ3THFBNC1HaVF0amNXb29fel9fWVl4MzV6eTRjU1dKUUMxTkJ0Mm1vcVdwZVZqNElrY0RPZnprY0JGeHI4</guid></item><item><title>I tried microdosing Ozempic... what happened shocked even doctors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison Burgess had struggled with her weight for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 25-year-old hit roadblocks on the path to her goal of losing 50lbs, including a workout regimen that didn’t seem to be helping and a persistent sweet tooth that had her reaching for desserts more than she’d like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-741f30b0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;
