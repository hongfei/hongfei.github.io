Then came a deadly measles outbreak in neighboring Texas. The number of Louisiana schoolchildren with exemptions to vaccine requirements doubled &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2024/09/06/kindergarten-vaccine-exemption-louisiana-increase" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the Covid pandemic, Dr. Avegno worked with state officials to tame high infection rates and promote vaccines. But after taking office last year, Gov. Jeff Landry began carrying out a promise to remake public health after the state’s Covid response, which he thought was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Landry, a Republican, created a position for a state surgeon general, appointing Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former congressman who had &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/louisiana-surgeon-general-blasts-states-past-covid-response/article_64153d82-7c40-11ef-8ed4-07b880ad2d8d.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;railed against the state’s “tyrannical” Covid response&lt;/a&gt; and argued that the real risk was not the virus itself but the vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So it was not entirely a surprise when Dr. Abraham announced last month that Louisiana would “no longer promote mass vaccination,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;calling efforts to do so during Covid&lt;/a&gt; “an offense against personal autonomy that would take years to overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To Dr. Avegno, it was a blunt reminder of how the political aftereffects of the pandemic have left her field worse prepared in many ways to fight the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’re in a very different world right now,” she said. “We are now prepared to throw the baby out with the bath water and leave ourselves incredibly vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

All but one of those people were vaccinated, Grace Kelly-McGovern, a Suffolk County health department spokesperson, said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who was exposed was a child too young to be vaccinated and has been quarantined, Kelly-McGovern said. She added that the child who was diagnosed with measles was also too young to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third case of measles reported in New York&lt;/a&gt; this year as outbreaks rage in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we follow this case and closely monitor potential exposures, we strongly encourage all residents to protect their health and the health of our youngest and most vulnerable residents by ensuring they are on time and up to date on their measles vaccines and all recommended and lifesaving immunizations,” Dr. Gregson Pigott, Suffolk County commissioner of health services, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get the first dose of the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella between 12 and 15 months and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6, before starting school. However, only about 81% of children in New York have received their first doses by the age of 2, according to the city and state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two New York City infants under 12 months old contracted the virus &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in unrelated cases, the New York City health department said last month. New York City had 14 measles cases last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey also reported three measles cases last month, which may have signaled community spread. But health officials issued an update on March 7 saying there is &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no ongoing transmission&lt;/a&gt; in the state at this time and no additional cases have been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:14:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNR2V5Sjg5UUd3eXRyVlluM3BVaGkyTEc0UmZXdk5HSnM4Q1NkS2dUbFEtV2pGZlpqa0tielNRWEVUdkVJOHdzUGVrQnFCNHRRY3Qwc0dVSFZIT2o2YUFjc2NQS3dTWmFOVWhyQ3lFa2FxY0xFSENwU1dtX2NfemFEX2hOdmxXdUJ0LTFudHpyTURFYnBOLU55Mmg3YXFTTkxtamRfUWdfS2tEejg</guid></item><item><title>What your kids drink matters, this doctor says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNUUdRcWVxX0xoZGx2WDFkcTJ2MjdjbUJRWVNEeHJ4OV9pQVktVmRfLTdnbzN2MmZxbjRZejA0cEItVVJBM1Yydll3MXZUdHFCT0VGc0JZV3puUHNPUWw2cWNRNjk4N0hHS3k1ZmRUNHNGVFRmNWxKbWNIWDMwSXNfUFpIajN4dmpETHVRaGQ2TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Children should consume limited amounts of plain milk daily while avoiding flavored milk containing added sugars.&lt;/li&gt;

            Are you feeding your children fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and plant-based proteins? Parents often think about what foods are healthiest for their little ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86aykby000v3b6m3d22969v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what about what your kids drink? Four leading national health and nutrition organizations &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend you also consider their beverage&lt;/a&gt; intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm867elqw00003b6mk0r3afip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the latest evidence and provides recommendations for healthy beverage intake in school-age children and adolescents. They include total hydration needs by age, the types of beverages that are recommended, those that should be limited, and those that should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b0q2m00113b6m2ltjjdh8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They help to answer common questions from parents, such as how much milk should kids drink, whether juice or juice drinks are recommended, and if sports drinks are healthy for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86ayoaj000y3b6m8v4ad603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To break down these recommendations, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00133b6me53xgoq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to consider what our kids are drinking?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00143b6mm7u2a0xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;There are several reasons families should care about their kids’ beverage choices, just as they care about their food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00153b6mxr6uv2qr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To start, it’s important that children get most of their calories from nutritious substances rather than so-called empty calories that have little or no nutritional value. Moreover, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00163b6m2974rwvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a healthy diet is key to reducing obesity and its myriad medical consequences such as diabetes and heart disease. Consumption of sugar-packed sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807548" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with developing overweight and obesity. And these beverages also contribute to &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-sugary-drinks-affect-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00173b6mwmvofbyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What kids drink is a key component of their overall diet, so it’s crucial that parents are aware of what products are healthy and recommended — and, equally, what should be avoided. This is not often easy, as some products may be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/fda-delays-final-rule-foods-healthy-label"&gt;marketed as healthy&lt;/a&gt; but are not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00183b6md95aqvjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much fluid should school-age kids drink every day?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00193b6melwb32ol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration needs depends on age. According to &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the expert panel&lt;/a&gt;, kids 5 to 8 years old should be drinking about 40 fluid ounces a day, which is about 5 cups. Those 9 to 13 years old should drink between 54 to 61 ounces, which is about 7 to 7.5 cups. Those 14 to 18 years old should drink between 61 to 88 ounces, or between 7.5 to 11 cups. These are general estimates, because total hydration needs will vary depending on the child’s size, level of physical activity and climate in which they live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001a3b6mrdtqqh80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I assume that water is the top recommended beverage, right?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001b3b6mrbfafds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Plain drinking water is just fine, and in fact is the best beverage for school-aged children. The vast majority of your kids’ hydration needs can be met through water alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001c3b6mr433jlnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about milk and juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001d3b6mc8jkwm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s take these separately. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; plain pasteurized milk — up to 20 fluid ounces a day for 5- to 8-year-olds and up to 24 fluid ounces a day for older children. Note that sweetened-flavored milk (chocolate milk, strawberry milk and so forth) is not recommended due to the high amounts of added sugars per serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001e3b6m94akj13o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The limit is a lot lower for juice. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to this panel&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of 100% juice is OK. And I mean a small amount: less than 4 to 6 ounces per day for 5- to 8-year-olds, less than 6 to 8 ounces for 9- to 13-year-olds, and less than 8 ounces in 14- to 18-year-olds. That means even adolescents should limit their intake of 100% juice to less than 1 cup per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001f3b6mu4fs9ups@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding juice, these are upper limits, not minimum amounts. Your kids don’t need to drink any juice to have a healthy diet. Children should try to meet their daily fruit recruitment by eating whole fruit, not by drinking juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001g3b6m60wp46u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about soy milk and almond milk? And is there a place for juice drinks that aren’t 100% juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001h3b6mey1tvuvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based milk alternatives like soy and almond milk are only recommended when there is a specific medical reason — such as an allergy to milk protein or if the child has to have a specific diet. Parents who choose these beverages should look for unsweetened products that do not have sugar or non-sugar sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001i3b6mueawagj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Juice drinks are in the same category as other sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas. These are not recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001j3b6mco3rndxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are diet drinks OK if they don’t contain sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel also does not recommend beverages that contain artificial chemical, non-sugar sweeteners. They cite lack of evidence on the safety and impact of these substances on the long-term health among children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001l3b6mdok1dniz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How about sports drinks? How can children who participate in after-school and recreational sports keep hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001m3b6mxqzbaa93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports drinks are not recommended for several reasons. First, many contain high amounts of sugar. Second, they are generally unnecessary. Most people can hydrate sufficiently using water, and they can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/sports-drinks-caffeine-children-athletes-wellness/index.html"&gt;replenish lost electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; through food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86bka9q00213b6mvsixn840@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A third issue to watch out for is that some sports drinks are conflated with energy drinks that contain caffeine and other stimulants. These are not substances that children should be consuming. The expert panel is clear that beverages with caffeine and other stimulants are not recommended for children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001o3b6ml55jq7v6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s your takeaway from this guidance on drinks, and how will you apply them to your own kids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001p3b6m9pqrrcvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; My overall takeaway is that plain drinking water is the best form of hydration. It’s ideal to get kids used to drinking water to replenish their fluids rather than to rely on sweetened substances. Pasteurized milk is also a good source of hydration. While 100% juice can be consumed in small amounts, all other drinks, including flavored milk and juice drinks, should not be part of daily consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001q3b6m67wv7r7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is generally what my family does. We emphasize water and milk. Juice is a treat — not something we offer every day. If my kids are at a party and there are juice drinks, we will let them drink those, but we tell them it’s a “special occasion” beverage. We do not offer sodas or sports or energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001r3b6mphcovd0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, I think the expert panel is right to raise awareness of the importance of healthy drinks, which should be considered just as much as healthy food in forming children’s diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon are the unlikely heroes of an accidental back-of-the-pantry natural history museum, with decades of Alaskan marine ecology preserved in brine and tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-are-actually-vital-for-some-species-survival-study-shows"&gt;tell us a lot&lt;/a&gt; about an ecosystem, because they're usually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-want-you-to-stop-hating-on-parasites-and-they-ve-got-a-12-step-plan-to-help"&gt;up in the business of several species&lt;/a&gt;. But unless they cause some major problem to humans, historically we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-we-don-t-know-about-parasites-could-be-disastrous-for-both-us-and-them"&gt;haven't paid them much attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a problem for parasite ecologists, like Natalie Mastick and Chelsea Wood from the University of Washington, who had been searching for a way to retroactively track the effects parasites had on Pacific Northwestern marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Wood got a call from Seattle's Seafood Products Association, asking if she'd be interested in taking boxes of dusty old expired cans of salmon – dating back to the 1970s – off their hands, her answer was, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cans had been set aside for decades as part of the association's quality control process, but i&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYz3FOsYTU"&gt;n the hands of the ecologists&lt;/a&gt;, they became an archive of excellently preserved specimens; not of salmon, but of worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIYz3FOsYTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the idea of worms in your canned fish is a bit stomach-turning, these roughly 0.4-inch (1-centimeter) long marine parasites, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakidae"&gt;anisakids&lt;/a&gt;, are harmless to humans when killed during the canning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone assumes that worms in your salmon is a sign that things have gone awry," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wood when the research was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the anisakid life cycle integrates many components of the food web. I see their presence as a signal that the fish on your plate came from a healthy ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A red circle around tweezers grabbing a piece of cooked salmon" class="size-full wp-image-123845" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An anisakid worm (circled in red) in a canned salmon fillet. (Natalie Mastick/University of Washington)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anisakids enter the food web when they are eaten by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn are eaten by larger species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how anisakids end up in the salmon, and eventually, the intestines of marine mammals, where the worms complete their life cycle by reproducing. Their eggs are excreted into the ocean by the mammal, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If a host is not present – marine mammals, for example – anisakids can't complete their life cycle and their numbers will drop," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wood, the paper's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 178 tin cans in the 'archive' contained four different salmon species caught in the Gulf of Alaska and Bristol Bay across a 42-year period (1979–2021), including 42 cans of chum &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chum_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus keta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), 22 coho (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;kisutch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 62 pink (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gorbuscha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and 52 sockeye &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus nerka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the techniques used to preserve the salmon do not, thankfully, keep the worms in pristine condition, the researchers were able to dissect the filets and calculate the number of worms per gram of salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A brownish worm magnified on a white background" class="size-full wp-image-123844" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A highly degraded anisakid found in canned salmon.

&lt;p&gt;"Seeing their numbers rise over time, as we did with pink and chum salmon, indicates that these parasites were able to find all the right hosts and reproduce," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mastick, the paper's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That could indicate a stable or recovering ecosystem, with enough of the right hosts for anisakids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg" alt="Graph showing number of cans from each year that contained each species" class="size-medium wp-image-145288" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-756x415.jpg 756w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-1536x843.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-2048x1124.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-600x329.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The distribution of canned salmon samples available for each salmon species in each decade. (Mastick et al., &lt;em&gt;Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's harder to explain the stable levels of worms in coho and sockeye, especially since the canning process made it difficult to identify the specific species of anisakid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Though we are confident in our identification to the family level, we could not identify the [anisakids] we detected at the species level," the authors &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So it is possible that parasites of an increasing species tend to infect pink and chum salmon, while parasites of a stable species tend to infect coho and sockeye."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastick and colleagues think this novel approach – dusty old cans turned ecological archive – could fuel many more scientific discoveries. It seems they've opened quite a can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;Ecology and Evolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just 25 years ago, the disease of measles was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#cdc_generic_section_3-measles-elimination-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;declared to have been eliminated from the U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cases were sometimes imported from overseas, from people who traveled from Europe, Africa, or Asia. But not until this year did we have a measles death on U.S. soil; and not until this year have we had a notorious anti-vaxxer as the head of our Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That department head, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has sorta-kinda acknowledged that vaccines have a role in preventing measles.  &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This opinion piece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that appeared under his name at Fox News carefully weaseled around the needed vaccine messages, saying that parents “should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options” about the vaccine, and that “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.” Kennedy previously led an anti-vaccine propaganda organization that spread misinformation so egregious it got &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/facebook-instagram-robert-kennedy-jr-misinformation.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kicked off of Facebook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast his messaging with the World Health Organization, which is able to lay it out more plainly: “Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people.” So far, the CDC’s website still has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;accurate information about measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including yet another plain statement that RFK, Jr. couldn’t bring himself to say: “The best protection against measles is measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While public health authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas and elsewhere&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are doing their best to contain the latest outbreaks, RFK Jr. is &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-it-would-be-better-if-everybody-got-measles/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;going on Fox News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; talking up the "benefits" of measles infection and making the vaccine sound as bad as the disease. So, with the people in charge of the measles response sending mixed messages, I want to make sure the correct information is getting out there. So here’s what you should know about measles and the measles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-mmr-or-mmrv-vaccines-are-the-best-protection-against-measles"&gt;The MMR or MMRV vaccines are the best protection against measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the absolute first and best thing to know: The measles vaccine protects you against measles. It is the &lt;em&gt;best protection we have&lt;/em&gt; against measles, as both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will openly tell you. The World Health Organization estimates that measles vaccination saved 60 million lives worldwide between 2000-2023. Most measles deaths were among children under 5 who were not vaccinated, or who didn’t get the two recommended doses on schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of measles vaccine available: the MMR vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella; and the MMRV vaccine that covers those three plus varicella, better known as chicken pox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended schedule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for MMR or MMRV vaccination is to get the first dose at an age of 12 to 15 months, and the second dose at age 4 to 6 years. Infants who are traveling or who live in a place with a measles outbreak can get a dose at age 6 months, but this protection isn’t expected to last long, so they will still need two more doses on the usual schedule. Adults and older children can also get a two-dose series (four weeks apart) if they didn't get it as kids or don't remember whether they got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="measles-is-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-known-and-can-be-deadly"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, and can be deadly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it worth vaccinating against measles? Yes, very much so. Anti-vaxxers like to point out that measles used to be a common childhood illness, which is true. But that doesn’t mean it’s harmless. Before vaccination was common, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6204.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013 report from the CDC’s vaccine advisory board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there were 500,000 cases of measles in the U.S. in a typical year. Those resulted in 500 deaths, 48,000 hospitalizations, and 1,000 cases of permanent brain damage from encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is also horrendously contagious, perhaps the most contagious human disease known. For a comparison, the average person with the flu will give it to 1.3 other people. For ebola, that number is 1.8. For smallpox, before we eradicated it through vaccination, it was 3.5 to 6. Chickenpox is near the top of the list, with each sick person giving it to 10 to 12 others. But measles beats even that, spreading to 12 to 18 people, on average. I’m getting my numbers from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this chart on Wikipedia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exact number for each outbreak can depend on the specifics of the time and place it occurs, but these statistics are pretty widely agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is so contagious that, after an infected person leaves a room, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the air and surfaces in that room can infect people for the next two hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is why just avoiding sick people isn’t enough, and why authorities announce where and when a person with measles was known to be in public, like &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/measles-case-childrens-hospital-south-philadelphia-20250312.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two Philadelphia children’s hospital locations on March 7 and 10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Anybody who visited those places at those times is being told to find out if they are protected from measles and to talk to their healthcare provider about getting the vaccine if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-measles-disease-is-so-so-much-worse-than-the-vaccine"&gt;The measles disease is so, so much worse than the vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy repeated a common and wrong anti-vaxxer talking point when he said that the measles vaccine “causes all the same illnesses” as measles. No, the vaccine does not give you measles. Even if he meant “all the same symptoms,” it’s still not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He specifically called out encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to death or brain damage. The measles vaccine causes 1-2 cases of encephalitis per &lt;em&gt;one million&lt;/em&gt; children vaccinated. Measles, on the other hand, causes encephalitis in 1-3 out of every &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; children who get the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to Encephalitis International&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, measles the disease has &lt;em&gt;1,000 times greater&lt;/em&gt; encephalitis risk compared to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also claimed that the measles vaccine “cause[s] deaths every year,” which isn’t true. The Infectious Disease Society of America &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “There have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people.” There &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been a very few deaths from vaccine side effects in children who were immunocompromised, which is why the first step in getting a vaccine is talking to a healthcare professional who can determine whether it’s safe for you to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-vaccine-can-be-given-after-youre-exposed-to-the-measles-virus"&gt;The vaccine can be given after you’re exposed to the measles virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to get an MMR vaccine is when you’re young, at 12-15 months and 4-6 years old. The second best time, if you’ve just been exposed to measles, is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. A dose of the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can be given within 72 hours of being exposed to the virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide last-minute protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you need the vaccine for this reason, ask your doctor. There is another option, which is to get a dose of immunoglobulin instead. It has to be one or the other, not both; the globulin can cancel out the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="vaccine-immunity-can-fade-but-not-as-much-as-rfk-jr-thinks"&gt;Vaccine immunity can fade, but not as much as RFK Jr thinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one dose of the MMR vaccine, you have a 93% chance of being protected against measles. After both recommended doses, that increases to 97%. This is exactly why two doses are recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s probably true that immunity from a measles infection lasts longer than from the vaccine, but the vaccine still gives lifelong protection to the vast majority of people who got their two doses. Kennedy said that vaccinated people lose “4.5%” of their immunity each year. I don’t know where he got that number, but I did find &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study that postulated a 0.04% waning per year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—that’s about 100 times &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than the number he cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-the-love-of-god-you-do-not-want-natural-immunity"&gt;For the love of god, you do not want “natural” immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s and earlier, natural immunity—from getting infected—was the only measles immunity we had. Everybody still got the disease, because children without any measles immunity were constantly being born. Eventually they’d encounter the virus, and get sick. As I discussed above, this was fine for most kids and catastrophic for some. Read &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/roald-dahl-letter-daughter/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roald Dahl’s letter about losing his daughter to measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t already. She was healthy, and then she had a routine case of measles, and then she felt “all sleepy” one day, and shortly afterward, she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way you get natural immunity is by rolling those dice. One child in every 1,000 died of measles. The other 999 carry that immunity with them for life, but only because they were lucky. The point of a vaccine is to give you the immunity &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the risk of complications and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means, sorry, no measles parties. Or, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as the Texas health department puts it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “No! DSHS strongly advises against intentionally exposing anyone to infectious diseases like measles.” As they correctly point out, you’d be risking severe complications and death for the attendees of the party, you can’t predict how severe the symptoms will be, and you’re creating a bunch of walking measles vectors who can then transmit the virus to the elderly, unvaccinated, and immunocompromised. Vaccination, on the other hand, provides protection for 97% of those who receive the vaccine, with far smaller risks of complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-know-if-you-need-a-measles-vaccine"&gt;How to know if you need a measles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I said that “everybody” used to get measles as a child, that’s true enough that the CDC and other health authorities rely on that fact to know who is immune. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;If you were born before 1957&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—meaning you are 69 or older in 2025—you are assumed to have already survived a bout of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also assume you are immune if you have medical records saying that you got two doses of the measles vaccine, or that you had a laboratory-confirmed case of measles, or that you have had a blood test that confirms your immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t remember whether you had the vaccine, you can get your immunity tested, but that’s not necessary. As the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “There's no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune to measles, mumps, or rubella.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in Texas, where the largest measles outbreak is currently occurring, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this page from Texas Health and Human Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has information on staying safe, including where to get an MMR vaccine in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — Researchers at Stanford Medicine have discovered a naturally occurring molecule that they believe is similar to the active ingredient in the same &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/weight-loss-drugs-compound-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes drugs&lt;/a&gt; that have shown weight loss potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP, is a naturally occurring molecule that can suppress appetite and promote weight loss in mice and pigs without causing common side effects like nausea, according to the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery may provide a solution for those who suffer from some of the more severe side effects of Wegovy and Ozempic, which include inflammation of the pancreas, changes in vision, increased risk of thyroid cancer and others.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues,” said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson. “That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/health-headlines/ap-yearslong-shortage-of-popular-weight-loss-and-diabetes-drugs-is-resolved-fda-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-about-half-of-americans-approve-of-using-weight-loss-drugs-to-treat-obesity-ap-norc-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; sales have soared in recent years, but shortages and challenges with insurance coverage have made it difficult for many patients to get the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 100 million adults in the U.S. are obese — defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher — and more than 22 million adults are severely obese, with a BMI of 40 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worsening measles &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; has spread to two other states, providing Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. his first real test of responding to a major public health incident.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak, which has killed two people to date and sickened nearly 260 &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;across three states&lt;/a&gt;, represents the first time Kennedy has had to reckon with his past as a longtime critic of vaccines and his new leadership of the federal health establishment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and advocates don’t think he is passing.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The response has been “as expected for a Secretary Kennedy HHS. But that’s not saying much,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak in her Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made two appearances on Fox News in recent weeks, where he downplayed the seriousness of measles and touted fringe theories about prevention and treatment, like the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits of vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; and cod liver oil over the measles vaccine, which is the only proven way to prevent infection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country — we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” Kennedy said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He suggested that natural immunity gained from a measles infection will provide better and longer-lasting protection than the vaccine. He said local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he has talked about the shot, he’s framed it as a personal choice while also suggesting the vaccine can cause just as much harm as the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in the past have been all-hands-on-deck affairs across the federal government, Jetelina said, pointing to a 2014 measles outbreak that began at Disneyland as well as the 2019 outbreak in New York. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This outbreak has largely been quiet. We’ve had the distant Fox News interviews. We’ve had one [CDC alert] and that’s about it, and that is not normal compared to past responses, and there’s certainly been very little transparency on what’s being done,” Jetelina said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) team of infectious disease “detectives” arrived on the ground to aid in the response earlier this month, a move that first required Texas officials to request federal assistance, because the agency can’t send a team without an official state ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But experts said an early communications blackout across the government ordered by the Trump administration may have prevented local health officials from sharing data and information with HHS, potentially delaying the response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts said one of the essential parts of controlling a measles outbreak is to partner with trusted messengers on the ground to spread the word that vaccines are safe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The messaging should be very clear and straightforward in that the way we stop a measles outbreak is through vaccination. And the way we prevent measles outbreaks is through vaccination. And so that should be the clear, unambiguous message coming out from HHS,” said William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But in a sweeping 34-minute interview that was posted on Fox Nation last week, Kennedy pledged that the CDC team would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency, including vitamin A and an antibiotic called clarithromycin.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, Texas, said he was concerned Kennedy’s words would dilute the message and make it more difficult to persuade people to get vaccinated.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy spoke about the distrust many in the Mennonite community have toward vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vaccines will be “recommended,” Kennedy said, but as a personal choice that must be recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He indicated the Mennonites have raised serious and legitimate concerns about the dangers of vaccines, and that he’d been told a dozen Mennonite children had been injured by vaccines in the county. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said the public doesn’t know the true risks of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what the risk profile is for these products. Americans have the right to know to be able to make an informed choice. You need to know the cost and the benefits. And we’ve never quantified the cost. And that’s why there’s so much mistrust and we need to restore government trust,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with Sean Hannity, Kennedy again touted the benefits of vitamin A as an almost miracle cure, something even a Kennedy adviser has cautioned against. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US – helps in Africa where there is deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” Brett Giroir, a first-term Trump health official now advising Kennedy on infectious disease policy, &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote in a post&lt;/a&gt; on the social platform X.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A has been used for years in children in developing countries with severe measles, but doctors have said the evidence of its effectiveness is mixed. It isn’t used widely in the U.S., likely because children aren’t vitamin A-deficient. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, the longtime executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Kennedy’s HHS is already behind the outbreak and risks falling even further, which could result in a national outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’s practicing medicine without a license, and he needs to be very careful,” Benjamin said. “Normally, what happens when you have someone who’s not a health professional? Their talking points are written by experts, and they stick to the script. And, you know, he’s saying things that are just wrong.”  &lt;/p&gt;

After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old. She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. "I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood'," says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Looking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice – a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10199804/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a symptom of iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00029-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;most common micronutrient deficiency&lt;/a&gt; in the world today, affecting roughly one in three people.

For babies and toddlers, not having enough iron &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17413089/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;can affect long-term development&lt;/a&gt;, with studies finding that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/69/suppl_1/S43/1815399" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;children are at risk&lt;/a&gt; of exhibiting behavioural issues – they are less happy and contented, and tend to be more socially inhibited. It can also influence children's motor skills, and cognitive ability even years after a deficiency has been corrected.

Infancy," says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length." As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built – in part – on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eLrdPC"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-e11d1f0-0 eVThlc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-1 kDQByp"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-e11d1f0-3 fBWdkT"&gt;Iron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-2 ewSByo"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-4 gxuhBx"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Anaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61235-5/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around half of all anaemia cases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;among other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.

"Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia," says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. "That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia," Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355040" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; – usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK259/#:~:text=Definition,deciliter%20(g%2Fdl)." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;haemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A matter of debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern – especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel," Pasricha says. "But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level – then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse," says Zimmermann.

"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] – it is that you didn't maximise your development," Corkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia – which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;To supplement or not to supplement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Given that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency – or even to supplement as a prevention measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But some researchers question this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron – but we didn't see that affect child development," says Pasricha. The "why", he says, "is something that the team is really grappling with".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37143078/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;when children had had iron deficiency at birth&lt;/a&gt;, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old – even if their iron levels had been corrected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else – such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673694921512" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poorer weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12729289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;less growth&lt;/a&gt; compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22064877/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;10 years old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31253407/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;16 years old&lt;/a&gt;, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Supplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;how supplementation can affect people's microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut – especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them… which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome," says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome – potentially towards a balance favouring "the pathogens we worry most about in babies", he says. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;This includes &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/21/1389.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;iron deficiency in endurance athletes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whether to take supplements – or give them to a child – is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A balanced diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Part of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables – non-heme sources of iron, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iron/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;which the body absorbs less readily&lt;/a&gt; than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better," Corkins says. "Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster – then you do supplementation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months.

The pad is available in five colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "Functions exactly as advertised. great for balance and core work. this pad has the perfect amount of "give" to work those areas. also the small waves on the surface help to prevent sliding on hard wood floors." — &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d03786e4b06805784b519f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="28"&gt;Mary S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A pair of adjustable dumbbells for weight training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Ho and Longobardi named adjustable dumbbells as a beneficial equipment option for resistance training. Why adjustable? "While free weights and resistance bands can help stimulate bone growth, it's important to begin with lighter resistance, gradually increasing in intensity to prevent injuries," Longobardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ho added that adjustable equipment is more suitable for long-term use as you slowly up the intensity of your workouts.

Currently the U.S. has a total of five updated COVID vaccines available.

(His responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-the-us-prepared-for-another-pandemic"&gt;Is the U.S. prepared for another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We are better prepared than we were five years ago. We are not as prepared as we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Preparedness is always an ongoing exercise. The U.S. military thinks a lot about preparedness, and they're constantly exercising, they're constantly updating. We need to have a very similar approach to thinking about health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next one may be a natural pandemic. The next one may be a biological agent that's been man-made. We have got to be keeping on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-has-improved-since-the-start-of-the-covid-19-pandemic--and-what-needs-to-improve"&gt;What has improved since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic — and what needs to improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We have a pretty good wastewater surveillance system that can help us track the spread of viruses around the country in a way we did not five years ago; we built that. Now a majority of communities are tracking various viruses using wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could be better is that we could expand that to more communities. We've got a majority, but we don't have everybody, and we could do that better. What I worry about is that that's going to get pulled back. A lot of that came originally from funding for COVID, and the current administration and their effort to cut everything may end up destroying our surveillance system, and that would be very, very bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The second thing that I think is better is we obviously have learned how to build vaccines very quickly. I think Operation Warp Speed was a huge success that taught us a lot about how to move vaccines forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I worry a lot about this administration's commitment to vaccines, even though ironically it was President Trump who brought us Operation Warp Speed. But obviously we have a health secretary who undermines vaccines at every step. I think that the big challenge is: Are we going to be able to continue investing in a new generation of vaccines or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A third area where I think we made a lot of progress that makes us better is if we get a major threat, we have learned how we can build up treatments quickly, particularly monoclonal antibodies. We built those very rapidly during COVID. They're going to be essential for the next pandemic, and we have to make sure we are investing in that platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-there-any-foreseeable-challenges-the-us-could-face-ahead-of-another-pandemic"&gt;Are there any foreseeable challenges the U.S. could face ahead of another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Where I worry we may be worse off than we were five years ago is the sort of confidence in the scientific process. There has been such an active undermining of public health, of overplaying every mistake in public health. Now let's be clear, public health officials, public health experts didn't get it all right, we made mistakes, all of us did, and there is an active campaign to find every error, every mistake, and amplify it to try to discredit the entire public health enterprise. That means that if there is another crisis, it's going to be very hard to build confidence in a science-based response. We've got a lot of work to do between now and whenever that next crisis happens to try to build up that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-we-be-worried-about-bird-flu"&gt;Should we be worried about bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bird flu has been something that a lot of us have been worried about for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a virus that has a very high fatality rate. In the literature, about half the people who've gotten infected have died. That is obviously extraordinarily high, and we've all worried about it. We've always hoped that we would never see the day where we see a bird flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, I think what we've seen in the last couple of years is things kind of moving in the wrong direction. It used to be that we almost never saw mammal populations getting infected. It was almost all largely among birds with the occasional spillover to people. Now we've seen large mammal die-offs. We've seen cows get infected. Obviously, the spread among birds is very large, and all of this is just substantially increasing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I think none of us knows if we're going to see a bird flu pandemic in three months, three years or 30 years. ... But the risk of it is very different now than it was five years ago, than even two years ago. When I say 'different,' I mean much higher, and we've got to start preparing with the concern that it might happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-about-measles"&gt;How about measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is that if vaccination rates fall below 95% in the community, that community starts becoming vulnerable to the spread of measles. Let's say somebody who's unvaccinated comes from traveling abroad, brings measles back home or increasingly just gets it here, and if they go to a community with an 80% or 85% vaccination rate, you're going to start seeing an outbreak because it's so contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Obviously, people who are not vaccinated are at risk. But I want to remind us that there are many people who are not vaccinated who wish they could be. You have immunocompromised kids who might be undergoing cancer therapy. They can't get the vaccine, and they rely on everybody around them being vaccinated to protect them. If you're in a community with low vaccination rates, those kids are very vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second is that the first dose of the measles vaccine isn't given until 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the CDC recommends that parents don't travel to areas of measles outbreaks with kids less than 1 year of age until they've had their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Well, that's a problem if the outbreak is in the community where you live. So you may be a parent who's very committed to protecting your kids with vaccines, but you have a 4-month-old who can't get a vaccine yet. And that kid is vulnerable if they get measles, and they can get quite sick, and there's not much you can do about it, obviously, except avoiding being in contact with people with measles.

			&lt;p&gt;Children under eight should not drink slushy ice drinks containing glycerol, researchers have warned after a string of hospitalisations in the UK and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brightly coloured drinks marketed towards children often use glycerol as a sweetener and anti-freezing agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But high levels can be harmful, especially to children – glycerol intoxication can cause shock, low blood sugar and loss of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="154838" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-reviewed medical review published in the &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of Disease in Childhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal on Tuesday, researchers looked into a "recent apparent surge in cases" in the UK and Ireland, and suggested children under eight should avoid the drinks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg" alt="slushy machine" class="wp-image-154858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Glycerol is sometimes added to icy drinks to keep them from freezing solid. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9doJlv_s/"&gt;dnberty/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied the medical records of 21 children aged two to seven who needed emergency treatment after drinking slushies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024 and many of the children became acutely ill within an hour, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children lost consciousness and showed signs of high blood acidity and low sugar, while four needed brain scans and one had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children all recovered swiftly, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slushy machines were invented in the United States in the 1950s, and the drinks do not always contain glycerol because sugar can be used to stop them freezing solid instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested the spate of cases could be linked to increased concern about high sugar consumption and sugar taxes adopted in the UK and Ireland in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food safety agencies in the two countries already advise that children aged four and under should not have slushies containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers said the age should be raised further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol," &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;they said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review's authors also said there could be cases where children have suffered less serious illness and not been taken to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, some parents said they supported raising the recommended age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Elsa Qorri, 46, told AFP she became worried after her two girls aged five and seven drank slushies last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They both got brain freeze and couldn't have any more," she said. "I'm not going to buy them again until the girls are a little bit older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 34 million people have diabetes in the US, and if you're one of them, what you eat impacts your blood sugar levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A breakfast rich in fiber, protein and healthy fats can help stabilize your blood sugar and prevent energy crashes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast combos like tofu scramble, overnight oats and Greek yogurt with cinnamon provide blood-sugar-stabilizing nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are one of the 34 million people in the US living with diabetes or the 97.6 million people with prediabetes, you probably know that what you eat directly impacts your blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One meal that’s often &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipped&lt;/a&gt; or overlooked is breakfast—yet it’s essential. If you find yourself scratching your head over what to eat, don’t fret. Breakfast foods don’t need to be complicated. “A healthy and balanced breakfast can be delicious, practical and easy to prepare,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vandanasheth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and diabetes expert in Los Angeles. From whole-wheat toast with nut butter and berries to overnight oats, these stress-free options provide the nutrients you need to keep your blood sugar in check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, regularly eating breakfast can “reduce sharp rises and falls in blood sugars, improve insulin sensitivity, prevent excess hunger and overeating later on, and stabilize energy and metabolism, which maintains blood sugar balance,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maria Fraga, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes alliance program director at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. When choosing a diabetes-appropriate breakfast, dietitians recommend high-fiber options. The American Diabetes Association recommends a goal of 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, you should eat &lt;em&gt;at least &lt;/em&gt;28 grams of fiber daily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there is no universal prescription for fiber needs at breakfast, “Aim to consume roughly 8 to 10 grams of fiber at breakfast to help you feel full and maintain steady blood sugar levels,” recommends Fraga.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other nutrients that help promote healthy blood sugars include protein and heart-healthy fats. This is because these two, along with fiber, help slow digestion and prevent high blood sugar spikes. Each breakfast choice below provides a mix of fiber, protein and healthy fats, while being low in added sugar and saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-tofu-scramble-with-avocado--greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Tofu Scramble with Avocado &amp;amp; Greens  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to helping with blood sugar control, protein helps you feel fuller for longer. When it comes to high-protein breakfast foods, eggs are usually top of mind for many. And while they are an excellent option, plant-based sources, like tofu, have been shown to benefit people with diabetes and those at risk of diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, if you love scrambled eggs, you’ll probably also enjoy tofu scramble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu scramble pairs well with avocados and dark leafy greens, which are rich in blood-sugar-stabilizing nutrients. One avocado contains almost 14 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados are also rich in heart-healthy fat. Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale or collards also contain fiber, plus they are high in volume, vitamins and minerals that can enhance feelings of fullness. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-whole-grain-toast-with-almond-butter-berries--chia-seeds"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Whole-Grain Toast with Almond Butter, Berries &amp;amp; Chia Seeds  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for something with natural sweetness? Consider a whole-grain, high-fiber bread with a smear of nut butter and antioxidant-packed berries. While any nut butter and fruit of your choice works well with toast, Sheth recommends it with almond butter, berries and chia seeds. When choosing a bread, dietitians recommend one with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice. As mentioned above, “Fiber slows down the conversion and absorption of glucose and helps with gut health,” notes Sheth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your toast isn’t the only one providing fiber here. Berries and chia seeds are also rich in fiber, with 1 cup of raw blueberries providing 4 grams of fiber and 1 tablespoon of chia seeds nearly 5 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is another protein-rich option for a filling breakfast. “Protein supports a feeling of satiety and helps prevent blood sugar spikes,” says Sheth. In addition to protein, strained (Greek-style) yogurt contains probiotics, calcium and vitamin D (fortified). When managing diabetes, your best bet is to choose a nonfat or low-fat plain one. This is because excessive saturated fat can increase your risk of heart disease, which people with diabetes are more likely to develop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Add a serving of fibrous fruit, chopped nuts and seeds, or a dollop of nut butter to make it extra filling and flavorful. Sheth loves pairing Greek or Icelandic yogurt with diced pear, chopped nuts and cinnamon. You can use fresh or frozen fruit for your convenience. Cinnamon has been studied for its therapeutic effects, from helping lower blood sugar and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cinnamon-and-lower-cholesterol-8535882" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; to reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One study suggests that using ⅓ teaspoon of cinnamon daily over 12 weeks reduced fasting blood sugar in people with prediabetes (the precursor to diabetes). Still, more research is needed to confirm this effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you take medicine to manage your blood sugar, talk to your health care provider before using cinnamon daily since it can interact with your medication.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats are a winner when it comes to a quick grab-and-go breakfast. Plus, you can simplify your routine and make several servings of overnight oats for the week. “My go-to is overnight oats for steady energy and balanced blood sugar,” says  &lt;a href="https://beyoutifulnutritionllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lila Cornelio, M.P.H., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian nutritionist. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872901/health-benefits-of-steel-cut-oats/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Oats&lt;/a&gt; are a source of complex carbohydrates and contain a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; called beta-glucan. Beta-glucan has various health benefits, including helping lower insulin resistance, reduce blood sugar and cholesterol and support your gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Increased intake of whole grains, like oats, is also linked to reduced risk of developing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

You can use ingredients like cherries, apples, blackberries, blueberries, pumpkin, flax, hemp or chia seeds and plant-based milks. Top with your favorite spices. Fraga recommends steel-cut oats with flaxseed, chopped peaches or strawberries, and cinnamon.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a savory twist, make a veggie bowl with your favorite foods. Vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, and are low in calories, which can help with weight management. Weight management is key to improving your blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When making a veggie bowl, you can easily incorporate the plate method—a tool to create balanced meals to avoid high or low blood sugar levels. The plate method encourages you to fill half of your plate with nonstarchy vegetables such as kale, onions, peppers, mushrooms, leeks, scallions and tomatoes, to name a few. Then, make one-quarter of your plate lean protein (think eggs or low-fat cottage cheese) and the other quarter carb-rich food, such as whole grains or starchy vegetables. You can drizzle olive oil on top for extra flavor and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for breakfast combinations to improve your blood sugar levels, focus on nutrients like fiber, protein and healthy fats. You can find these in foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, strained (Greek-style) yogurt and avocado, which help you make a delicious, sustainable and nutritious breakfast. Remember that when it comes to managing diabetes, there is no one-size-fits-all. So, working with your primary health care provider for individualized assessment is always best. &lt;br&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Being married triples the risk of men becoming obese, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of piling on the pounds increased for both sexes after marriage, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women's risk of being overweight was 39% higher - and men's 62% - compared with unmarried couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But married men were 3.2 times more likely to be classed as technically obese than their unmarried counterparts, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding wasn't mirrored in females, which the Polish researchers said could be because women who are obese "are more often stigmatised" by society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Alicja Cicha-Mikolajczyk, from Warsaw's National Institute of Cardiology, suggested women "cannot accept living with obesity" and are more likely to take action to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the NHS generally classes obese people as having a body mass index (BMI) of above 30, and being overweight is associated with a BMI of 25-30.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;However, the measure (which looks only at height and weight) has been criticised by some as over simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study - which looked at 2,405 Polish people, typically aged 50 - also found getting older increased the risk of becoming heavier in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;        
    
&lt;p&gt;Each extra year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women; and the risk of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171/1" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by 4% in men and 6% in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression or poor health knowledge also had a significant impact on the risk of women becoming obese - but this wasn't found in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more from Sky News:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/norwegian-ski-jumpers-suspended-in-cheating-scandal-over-modified-suits-13327349" target="_blank"&gt;Ski jumpers suspended over modified suits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-hostages-killed-after-separatist-militants-hijack-train-carrying-hundreds-of-passengers-13326922" target="_blank"&gt;Hostages killed after militants hijack train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concluded: "Age and marital status have undeniable impact on living with overweight or obesity in adulthood regardless of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In turn, inadequate health literacy and having at least borderline depression were associated with obesity in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears from our results that the dissemination of health knowledge and health promotion across the lifespan could reduce the worrying phenomenon of increasing levels of obesity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain in May.&lt;/p&gt;

            Cases in the ongoing measles outbreak have risen to 258 across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and state health departments are urging more people to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00023b5vqs67xs0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. And what we need to do is give them the best information and encourage them to vaccinate. The vaccine does stop the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000g3b5vav88tonm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy also downplayed the safety of the vaccine and wrongly told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that measles outbreaks could be driven in part by people who have waning immunity from the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00053b5v0v5kz16s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you and I were kids, everybody got measles, and measles gave you … lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people, it wanes,” Kennedy told Hannity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000h3b5vxwevrnfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some years, we have hundreds of these outbreaks. … And, you know, part of that is that there are people who don’t vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes. The vaccine wanes 4.5% per year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000i3b5v3z5d4ls8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says that if that were the case, measles wouldn’t have been declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000j3b5vo28cp0c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s some dispute among experts about how much protection may wane, if at all. However, they all agree that in most cases, the vaccine confers lifelong immunity against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000k3b5vfzpe8mrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000l3b5vcnumhxex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even those who may have waning immunity will not transmit large amounts of virus, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000n3b5vu7qf6jqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of antibodies created by the vaccine might decrease over time, but with a virus like measles, its longer incubation period gives the body’s immune memory cells more time to help fight the infection. This enables long-lasting immunity from vaccination, Offit explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000o3b5v4h6ba485@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 cases reported each year, many of them related to international travel. There have been an average of about eight outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years, at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But even the worst outbreaks typically stay under 50 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86g9olv00023b6mxzc4gjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year with more than 200 cases. The others were 2014, with an outbreak tied to Disneyland, and 2019, when a nearly year-long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;outbreak in New York came&lt;/a&gt; within weeks of ending the nation’s elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00043b5vh4511r14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Kennedy’s statements promoted natural immunity, acquired when someone gets measles, over vaccine induced immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00063b5va3ru8iqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. People who were naturally infected with measles will also have immunity, but not without serious risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00083b5vntjmvb6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of a vaccine is to induce the immunity that is a consequence of natural infection without paying the price of natural infection,” Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00093b5vt0ttubit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The price of infection can be high: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000a3b5v2gwpstk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000b3b5vbwnrlb9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another possible consequence of infection is “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/measles-amnesia-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” When the measles virus infects immune cells, it can erase the body’s memory of how to fight other infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “So if you want to take the natural immunity route … you’re destroying your previously existing immune memory and putting yourself at risk for every other infection that you could get. And so there is no world in which measles is good for the body, and there’s no world in which getting measles infection is better than getting a measles vaccine,” Mina said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000d3b5vvmg0itxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also inaccurately said vaccine-induced immunity may not be passed through breast milk to nursing infants the way natural immunity is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “He is wrong. Maternal antibody transfer is a key form of neonatal protection against infectious diseases,” said Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. “Even when a mother had vaccination many years ago, antibodies still transfer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This is especially important because infants can get protection against the virus through antibodies from their mother in the first six months of life, when they are too young to be vaccinated, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy also incorrectly described adverse events from the MMR vaccine, saying it “causes deaths every year. … It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes: encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86h84sf00053b5vufashffu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, called this “disinformation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The measles vaccine is incredibly safe,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This is what anti-vaccine activists do is, they play up and try to scare you with the very, very rare side effects and forget to tell you about the horrific effects of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles infection can cause encephalitis and blindness, but only a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; of these kinds of illnesses related to vaccination have ever been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4599698/pdf/nihms724114.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reviewed reports from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, in addition to medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, did not find evidence to suggest “a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000s3b5vettes80u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The MMR vaccine is extremely safe. The most common side effects that people may get is the low-grade fever for a few days, and sometimes people can get this temporary rash It usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Those are by far the most common symptoms, and there are a few more that are much less common, but they are extremely rare,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86gt7ax00023b5vgkyh5pve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More serious side effects from vaccination are extremely rare, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000t3b5vvqkkehye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of those [common side effects] are signs that the vaccine is working and your immune system is mounting the responses it’s supposed to to gain memory to protect you later. But many folks are touting these as significant adverse events, and so I think that the devil is really in the details on this,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

                Scientists who research vaccine hesitancy and uptake are seeing their federal funding cut, under a Trump administration move. It's part of a swathe of cuts to ongoing research funded by NIH.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is slashing long-standing areas of research funded by the National Institutes of Health, claiming they no longer align with the agency's priorities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The latest target?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Millions of dollars in NIH grants for studying vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels. It's work that's particularly relevant as a measles outbreak grips the Southwest amidst diminishing vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, scientists around the country have begun receiving letters stating their existing grants — money already awarded to them in a competitive process — were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the cuts appeared to primarily target research on LGBTQ+ health and other areas that were deemed in conflict with President Trump's executive orders on gender and "diversity, equity and inclusion."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, more than 40 grants related to vaccine hesitancy have been cancelled, and there are mounting concerns that research on mRNA vaccines could be on the chopping block next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR obtained information about the changes from two NIH staffers and one person familiar with NIH's activities who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. And, NPR reviewed emails and documents they provided.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I want to underscore just how unprecedented — how abnormal all of this is," one longtime NIH official told NPR. "This is not how we operate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An email circulated among NIH leadership this week included a list of grants that were to be terminated and details on the specific language to use in those notices. "It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment," the email states.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how many grants have been cancelled in total under the Trump administration. Neither the NIH nor its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, replied to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It appears that there are forces intent on destroying our existing vaccine enterprise," says &lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/286/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Temte&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin who studies vaccine hesitancy. "Defunding research on vaccine hesitancy is the latest example of this effort."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;mRNA research may be at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In what some at the agency view as an ominous sign, the NIH's acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli also requested information last week about the funding that supports mRNA vaccine research, technology that underpins the COVID-19 shots from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to an email reviewed by NPR. A similar call for data preceded the termination of the other vaccine grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"NIH staff internally are very worried that the mRNA grants will follow the outcome of the vaccine hesitancy grants and be terminated," according to one of the NIH employees who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. "There are widespread concerns that this will limit the ability to combat pandemics and halt promising lifesaving cancer treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reviewed the NIH list of 130 of these awards issued by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, which funds the most mRNA research. This includes efforts to develop vaccines for a variety of diseases, including Lyme disease, dengue and a sometimes life-threatening gastrointestinal infection known as &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the NIH like the National Cancer Institute also fund this work, because mRNA technology holds promise for targeted cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am on pins and needles constantly," says &lt;a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/microbiology/profiles/richner-justin/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Richner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Illinois, Chicago. "I'm really kind of waiting for the shoe to drop in terms of looking for the email saying the grant has been canceled."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richner's $1 million, 4-year NIH grant is on the agency's internal list. His lab is working to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect against dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an outrageous incursion on the way in which the NIH is managing the money that's been appropriated by Congress," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-varmus" target="_blank"&gt;Harold Varmus&lt;/a&gt;, a Nobel Prize winning professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College who ran the NIH from 1993 to 1999. "The idea that we're going to turn one of the most prestigious aspects of federally supported activities into a graveyard is very troubling to everybody."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/aaron-scherer" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Scherer&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Iowa who studies vaccine hesitancy, says his grants are not canceled as far as he knows, but given what's happening, he assumes that NIH will not be funding his future proposal "regardless of its scientific and health merits."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health disparities and LGBTQ+ research loses ground&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine research is just the latest target in the Trump administration's expanding effort to cut off NIH-funded researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A first wave of letters went out last month to researchers notifying them their grants were being canceled because they did not fit with President Trump's executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Letters of termination reviewed by NPR state "no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities," but a current NIH employee told NPR that the scientific staff at their institute who would be responsible for making that determination are not being consulted. "They're not checking with us," said the person, adding that these termination decisions are coming with virtually no notice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to an internal memo, NIH staff were directed to separate awards into different categories depending, for example, on whether the "sole purpose of the project is DEI related" or could still be viable if modified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidance also has implications for hundreds of awards in the coming months, because many "Notices of Funding Opportunities" have been taken down, and grants that applied through those notices will not get their funding, either, the NIH staffer told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brittany-charlton/" target="_blank"&gt;Brittany Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard University, says she's tallied two dozen awards that have been terminated among her colleagues for work that touches on issues like HIV prevention and Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cuts are not only affecting research on the LGBTQ+ population but also other vulnerable communities, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not studying fringe issues, and they're not at all ideological either,"  Charlton says, "The research that's being abruptly terminated by the federal government right now is really meant to identify what underlies some of these disparities and help to address them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The good and the bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html"&gt;For reference&lt;/a&gt;, the optimal LDL level for adults is less than 100 mg/dL, and optimal HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher. Higher LDL levels can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and other health problems, while higher HDL has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. Though some of the changes reported in the study were small, the researchers note that they could be meaningful in some cases. For instance, an increase of 5 mg/dL in LDL is enough to raise the risk of a cardiovascular event by 2 percent to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three different models to adjust for a variety of factors, including basics like age, sex, body mass index, as well as medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as exercise, dietary habits, and smoking. All the models showed the same associations. They also broke out the data by what kinds of alcohol people reported drinking—wine, beer, sake, other liquors and spirits. The results were the same across the categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study isn't the first to find good news for drinkers' cholesterol levels, though it's one of the larger studies with longer follow-up time. And it's long been found that alcohol drinking seems to have some benefits for cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;A recent review and meta-analysis by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate drinkers had lower relative risks of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis also found that drinkers had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (death by any cause). The study did, however, find increased risks of breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.stopalcoholabuse.gov/media/pdf/Report-on-Alcohol-Intake-and-Health.pdf"&gt;Another recent review&lt;/a&gt; found increased risk of colorectal, female breast, liver, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the new cholesterol findings aren't an invitation for nondrinkers to start drinking or for heavy drinkers to keep hitting the bottle hard, the researchers caution. There are a lot of other risks to consider. For drinkers who aren't interested in quitting, the researchers recommend taking it easy. And those who do want to quit should keep a careful eye on their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their words: "Public health recommendations should continue to emphasize moderation in alcohol consumption, but cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored after alcohol cessation to mitigate potential [cardiovascular disease] risks," the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published last year, are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world. Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a dietary fiber in the class fructan. Another is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), and it is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg" alt="Aerial view of a cup of tea next to sachets of sweetener" class="size-full wp-image-144930" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fructooligosaccharide is often used as a natural low calorie sweetener. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFb-9YB388/"&gt;towfiqu barbhuiya/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg" alt="Illustration of bacteria in the gut" class="size-full wp-image-144933" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins.

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXEf1Xfh1bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's College is home to the United Kingdom's largest adult twin registry, and twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/2/81/5237462?login=false#127953545"&gt;Past studies on rodents&lt;/a&gt; suggest that high-fiber supplements, like inulin and FOS, can 'feed' the colon's microbiome, allowing 'good' bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these bacterial players are &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;also linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved cognitive function in both mice and &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200488"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg" alt="Twin sisters smiling with arms around each other" class="size-full wp-image-144937" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.

Some experts are now so convinced by the results, they &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/gut-brain"&gt;refer to the gut&lt;/a&gt; as the body's 'second brain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way these two nervous systems work together remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent twin study at KCL suggests that consuming certain 'brain foods' may be a promising way to treat cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while prebiotics might improve some aspects of cognitive function in an aging brain, like memory and processing times, there don't appear to be significant physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss didn't improve among aging twins taking high-fiber supplements, despite the fact that inulin and FOS are important factors in musculoskeletal maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These plant fibers, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; geriatrician Claire Steves at KCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Senior couple completing a jigsaw" class="size-full wp-image-144939" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain.

&lt;p&gt;That said, females are more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, and studies like the current one support the emerging idea that cognitive decline is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-reveals"&gt;not always a disease of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but may involve external factors, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut has its fingers in many bodily 'pies', including the immune system and the central nervous system. Feeding its microbiome certain &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410452/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could open the door to treating a plethora of illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

						The Pennsylvania Department of Health and Philadelphia Department of Health are notifying the public about a potential measles exposure at two locations.South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy CenterThis building includes CHOP Pediatric Primary Care South Philadelphia, Health Department Health Center #2, and the South Philadelphia Library, though there were no potential exposures in the library.1700 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145Friday, March 7 between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m.Saturday, March 8, between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.CHOP Emergency Department3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104Monday, March 10, 2025, 7:55 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.The infected person was exposed while traveling abroad, according to health officials. It is not connected to the recent measles case in Montgomery County or cases in other parts of the country.What to doIf you were potentially exposed, follow these instructions from the health department:Determine if you are protected against measles. Generally, you are considered protected if you:Were born before 1957, orHave already had measles, orHave a blood test showing immunity to measles, orHave written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine)Look at your vaccination records or ask your health care provider to see if you have already had the age-appropriate dose or doses of this vaccine.Measles vaccine is routinely recommended for children 12–15 months old with a second dose given at age 4–6 years. Infants under 12 months are not routinely eligible for vaccine and are not protected.If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. The vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles.If you are not protected from measles, there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.If you were at the CHOP Emergency Department on March 10 during the times listed above, you should receive a dose of MMR vaccine before March 13. Talk to your health care provider to learn how you can get this vaccine. The health department has additional resources on where to get vaccines on its website. If you do not receive an MMR vaccine, you will need to stay home for 21 days.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 7 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 27. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 8 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 28. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you develop any measles-like symptoms through March 31, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by a rash.Tell your doctor before visiting that you may have been exposed to measles.You should also notify the Philadelphia Department of Public Health by calling 215-685-6740, then pressing option 5.About measlesMeasles is a virus that spreads very easily from person to person among unvaccinated people. Anyone with measles can spread the virus to others who are not immune through direct contact with respiratory droplets, or through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing.The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Measles is contagious for four days before to four days after the rash starts.In some people, including infants and those with weakened immune systems, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection or death.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University have tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/nucleotide+excision+repair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleotide excision repair&lt;/a&gt; (NER). NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out (excise) damaged DNA with surgical precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52860-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, the team has built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material," said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. "NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/harmful+mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;harmful mutations&lt;/a&gt; can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging," he said. "Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;The three acts of repair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon—the PInC—in the third and final stage of repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the "patient" stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase," Ivanov said. "How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?"&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap," he added. "Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy," Ivanov said. "But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summit's final simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer—capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second—was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine," Ivanov said. "Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

The study underscores that dementia and cognitive decline share risk factors with heart disease, suggesting these conditions are largely preventable by managing diet, exercise, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following guidelines such as the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8—eight essential behaviors to improve cardiovascular and brain health—can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia. Experts argue that integrating these heart-healthy habits into everyday life offers a practical strategy for reducing the growing global burden of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Risk Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dementia and heart disease share common modifiable risk factors, such as diet, blood pressure, and cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; Globally, dementia cases have risen 160% since 1990, outpacing cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative Strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting the American Heart Association’s “Life Essential 8” could significantly protect brain health and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average adult brain only weighs about 3 pounds, yet it is one of the most complex and vital organs of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognition may decline and our brains become prone to disease as we age, so as medical advances and other factors help the world’s population live longer the prevalence of brain disease, including dementia, is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keeping our brains healthy may be easier than people realize with some helpful guidance from the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108135"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain in the shape of a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal brain health includes the functional ability to perform all the diverse tasks for which the brain is responsible – including thinking, moving and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many modifiable risk factors for cognitive loss, such as an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle, develop as early as childhood and adolescence. As we age, our ability to remember, problem-solve, think and communicate decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that many of the same health risk factors that cause heart disease and stroke also contribute to a decline in overall brain health,” said Mitchell S. V. Elkind, M.D., M.S., FAHA, a neurologist and former volunteer American Heart Association president and currently its chief clinical science officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like with heart disease and stroke, most brain disease is preventable. However, the combination of an aging population and projected substantial increases in high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes are likely to lead to unprecedented growth in many types of brain disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data reported in the &lt;em&gt;2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of U.S. and Global Data From the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of death among all neurological disorders, including stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More females than males die of dementia each year because of the higher prevalence of elderly females compared with males. Females accounted for 66.7% of U.S. dementia deaths in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 6.9 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analysis of Medicare data reported in the update estimates that prevalence will more than double to 13.9 million Americans by 2060.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also reported in the statistical update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, nearly 57 million people had Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in 2021, a 45% increase since 2010 and a 160% increase over the past 30 years (1990-2021). For comparison, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease increased 33% over the past decade and 111% over the past 30 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The increase in global deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is outpacing that of cardiovascular disease even more – dementia deaths increased by nearly 195% since 1990, compared to a 57% increase in cardiovascular deaths during that same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimated U.S. healthcare spending on dementia more than doubled from $38.6 billion in 1996 to $79.2 billion in 2016. Spending on dementias was among the top 10 healthcare costs in the United States in 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The burden of brain disorders is high. Dementia as a cause of death is growing faster than any other disease, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. Paradoxically, as we get better at treating other conditions, like heart disease, stroke and cancer, dementia as a cause of death increases,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using many of the same tools and information that have helped us successfully address cardiovascular risk factors and reduce the burden of heart disease over the past several decades, we should be able to do the same for brain disorders and promote brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. These include 4 health behaviors and 4 health factors identified as key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Eat Better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Be More Active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Quit Tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Get Healthy Sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Control Cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association is committed to advancing brain science through innovative research that will help scientists shed new light on the causes and contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly as it relates to heart and vascular health,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we can support individuals and communities in thinking of brain health not only in terms of an absence of disease, but also in a more positive way.

Researchers scanned the brains of people playing a simple team game and observed how participants kept track of interactions with both teammates and opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than monitoring each individual separately, the brain creates simplified patterns that capture the essential dynamics of group behavior, particularly in the prefrontal cortex—an area important for decision-making and social skills. These findings help explain how we efficiently manage and interpret the constant flood of social information encountered daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Shortcuts:&lt;/strong&gt; Our brains use simplified mental patterns to manage complex social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain simultaneously tracks both individual players and the sequence of their interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific brain activity in the prefrontal cortex encodes simplified social interaction patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains use basic ‘building blocks’ of information to keep track of how people interact, enabling us to navigate complex social interactions, finds a new study led by University College London (UCL) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers scanned the brains of participants who were playing a simple game involving a teammate and two opponents, to see how their brains were able to keep track of information about the group of players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108130"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and puzzle pieces." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that rather than keeping track of the performance of each individual player, specific parts of the participants’ brains would react to specific patterns of interaction, or ‘building blocks’ of information that could be combined to understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Marco Wittmann (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences and Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research) said: “Humans are social creatures that are capable of keeping track of highly complex and fluid social dynamics, requiring a massive amount of brain power to remember not only individual people but also the various relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to keep up with a group social interaction in real time, our brains must be using heuristics – mental shortcuts that help people make decisions quickly – to compress and simplify the wealth of information involved, with a system that minimises complexity while still allowing flexibility and detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this research, we found that our brains appear to use a set of basic ‘building blocks’ that represent fundamental aspects of social interactions, enabling us to quickly figure out new and complex social situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team of scientists from UCL and the University of Oxford used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of 88 participants who were playing a simple game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the scanner, the study participants were given a series of information about how they, a partner, and their opponents were faring in a game, and needed to keep track of the information in order to answer a question comparing performances of different players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann explained: “We were interested to see whether our brains would use an ‘agent-centric’ frame of reference where specific parts of the brain keep track of each player’s performance, or a ‘sequential’ frame of reference tracking the information in the order it was received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that people actually do both, but our brains are able to simplify all of this information into bite-sized chunks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists were able to pinpoint specific patterns of activity in the brain that represented a few specific ‘building blocks’, each representing a pattern of interaction between the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one building block kept information about how well a participant and their partner were doing relative to the other team. A bigger difference in performance between the two teams corresponded to an increase in brain activity related to this building block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific patterns of activity were found in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann said: “As we develop social skills in life, our brains are likely learning specific interaction patterns that we come across again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns may become hard-wired into our brains as building blocks that get assembled and recombined to construct our understanding of any social setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27444f554e54094b4649426752444b09464409524c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Lane – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08705-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Marco Wittmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:10:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE55aWczcDF5Umx1dVFSU1N3OTdNVHFuYzFRZVR0ZVNGQXpYSU1hM05MM0pYQmRWRFcwUC1BNGpXU0lQYlM1MG1rVng0R0t3bnh6bU9VejlqN1oxdGFwaThkOF9xek8yakNBTFhBNktmMV9CZw</guid></item><item><title>CDC’s reported study on vaccines and autism could test RFK Jr.’s pledges to a key senator - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOdGZSREZBLUR1Z0NENTZobWQyQ1dVTHg5RWh0b01yTkd0bUFCUlZVU25XT0dDZzJTSkNLOHc4VlJGVXB4Umg0R0p5aS04dkpBNy1PbVp3d0dnVHM0YUhyRjMydUNpR1ZRNm1NN1JBSlRTUTVPa1UwRGlnaXZtZ2cwWFNzOVE4dlhLMnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of a new federal plan to study whether there’s a link between vaccines and autism could serve as an early test of the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;commitments Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said he received&lt;/a&gt; from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in exchange for his support for RFK Jr.’s confirmation as Health and Human Services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, multiple news outlets reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning the study. Cassidy said last week that such a study would be a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/05/trump-nih-nominee-jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-research-on-vaccines-autism/"&gt;waste of time and money&lt;/a&gt;, because research has already shown there’s no link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he backed Kennedy’s confirmation, one of the commitments Cassidy said he received was a pledge to keep communication lines wide open and to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-vote-hhs-secretary-how-kennedy-moved-from-fringe-to-center-of-power/"&gt;consult Cassidy on vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, when Cassidy was asked Tuesday for his reaction to the reports, he said he’s not even sure the agency truly intends to run such a study. &lt;/p&gt;

But some detractors attribute the clearing of skin simplyto an increase in water intake and overall hydration—something that also naturally aids with digestion, constipation, and energy. And though &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24930587/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; on the clinical efficacy of chlorophyll used for acne treatment did find a reduction in acne and sebum levels, it was with the use of &lt;i class=" "&gt;topical &lt;/i&gt;chlorophyllin, not an oral supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Supplement makers claim that chlorophyll can do many things, but few of the claims are backed by scientific evidence,” says Surampudi. Research surrounding what chlorophyll actually does to the body is very limited, with many of the existing studies done on animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Can you have too much chlorophyll?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Naturally occurring chlorophyll from plants isn’t considered harmful to humans, even in large amounts. Experts generally recommend anywhere from 100 mg to 300 mg of liquid chlorophyllin per day for adults, but more studies are needed to determine if this is a truly effective dose in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Since the FDA does not regulate supplements, it is difficult to know upper limits,” says Surampudi.  “Chlorophyllin supplements can have side effects, including gastrointestinal issues, skin reactions, and allergic reactions.” While they are generally considered safe, she stresses that it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. Additionally, there has been no research on the safety of chlorophyllin on women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Going the natural route&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you’re still chlorophyll curious, you can get your intake by simply eating your greens. Foods high in chlorophyll include spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, alfalfa, parsley, green cabbage, asparagus, chlorella, and spirulina. In addition to these foods, it’s generally important to eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:00:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZVJRM2dicHJtMUxtMHRGM3ozZjZCZ09Gc2E0MzctVXIzcDczSUd4TTRXcklJakJDcHdwRzJEemcxZm45Y25raHVDSnJobVlsdlNrVnp5emRIMmJxZ09DU3l1cE9sU05KU2pWbExBUklCRDBfczMyUzNpUml0NVliTVhRX3U3eFZzcTg3ckdR</guid></item><item><title>Scientists find natural molecule that works like Ozempic - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DUDhRbExzSGdxZTVobFgteG1USDF0VFZtOWtZVXJuc0lxQTdZRzQ0Yl9OMV9RUml0RlkyazkxME52RmdZV0ZsbWp2Rl9RSU03MGJfM2x1QWFVOUpBZTNtcjNscERMQlBnVzNnZEFsUdIBdEFVX3lxTE5ZNVRPTEpqZHZkQVVSS3dMSWcxeWRsZlJmMkROUEUxQjBYa055ZEdaTkttc1QtWG1Rd19LX3NtcU9qUUhUUzQ3V0Fjc3N5dVQwZ3c3MzBRRjIzQURUc1FXWDVzaHhjT2NTV3R0Nk92bmNWS0E1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Most &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;confirmed human cases&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu in California — there have been 38 — have also been in San Joaquin Valley, which includes Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Tulare counties, reported Fresnoland. All but two of these cases contracted the avian flu through exposure to dairy herds, according to the outlet. The CDC reports that there have been a total of 70 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans across 13 states (including one death), but the agency rates the current public health risk as low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, outbreaks of avian flu have slowed over the past two weeks, and wholesale egg prices are dropping, according to the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;March 7 report. &lt;/a&gt;For now, though, the average &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/california-restaurants-egg-shortage-20014211.php" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;price of eggs&lt;/a&gt; remains high in California: $10.35 per dozen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,” read the USDA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, the USDA predicted egg prices would &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/egg-price-increase-bird-flu-usda-20189782.php" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;rise 41%&lt;/a&gt; this year.

I’m a &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/transdisciplinary-areas-of-excellence/sustainable-communities/about/profile.html?id=lina"&gt;registered dietitian and nutritional neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt;. My research, along with the work of others in the field, shows that your diet and lifestyle choices may contribute to your struggles. These two factors are closely interconnected and could be the key to understanding what’s holding you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, not getting enough of three essential nutrients – &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; – is linked to low energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40% of adult Americans &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2010.12.001"&gt;are deficient in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. Low levels are linked to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency"&gt;fatigue, bone pain, muscle weakness, mood disorders and cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"&gt;Foods high in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; include fatty fish like salmon, sardines, freshwater rainbow trout, fortified dairy products and egg yolks. Among the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13114144"&gt;sources for vegetarians and vegans&lt;/a&gt; are fortified plant-based milks and cereals and some kinds of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pdf/factsheets/vitamind-consumer.pdf"&gt;recommended daily amount of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is 400 international units, or IU, for infants up to 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70 and 800 IU for people over 70. Just over 5 ounces (150 grams) of sockeye salmon fillet has about 800 IU of vitamin D. If you are low in a vitamin, your doctor may prescribe you a higher dose than the recommended daily amount to elevate your blood levels to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20% of Americans have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.26947A"&gt;inadequate vitamin B12 levels&lt;/a&gt;, which can impair energy production and lead to anemia, resulting in fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low levels of B12 are notably higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jppr.1897"&gt;in older people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;pregnant and lactating women&lt;/a&gt;, people with gastrointestinal disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.ibdrelief.com/learn/complications-of-ibd/vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-in-ibd/vitamin-b12-and-ibd#"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, those who &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-b12/art-20363663"&gt;take certain medications&lt;/a&gt; like proton-pump inhibitors, and people with &lt;a href="https://ranimd.com/articles/does-drinking-alcohol-affect-vitamin-b12-levels#"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because vitamin B12 is primarily found in meat, fish, dairy and eggs, vegetarians and vegans should consider taking a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;vitamin B12 supplement&lt;/a&gt;. The recommended daily amount for anyone ages 4 and older is 2.4 micrograms, about what’s found in 3 ounces of tuna or Atlantic salmon. Pregnant and breastfeeding women &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/vitamin-b12-cobalamin"&gt;require slightly more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking B12 supplements can be as effective as getting the vitamin from food – and taking the supplement with food &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-getting-enough-b12#:%7E"&gt;may enhance its absorption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, here’s a note on supplements in general: While they can be beneficial, they shouldn’t replace whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are supplements &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements"&gt;less strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration compared to prescription and over-the-counter drugs&lt;/a&gt;, making their potency uncertain, but real food also provides a complex array of nutrients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1279925"&gt;that work in a synergistic way&lt;/a&gt;. Many supplements on the market boast multiple servings of vegetables, but nothing beats the actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 87% of adults ages 40 to 59, and about 80% of those 60 and older, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db399-H.pdf"&gt;don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; to meet dietary recommendations. Neither do &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/prenatal-supplements-largely-lack-the-recommended-amount-of-omega-3-fatty-acids-to-help-prevent-preterm-birth-new-research-244231"&gt;many pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for brain health, and a deficiency can lead to higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10060663"&gt;anxiety and depression levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0000000000000862"&gt;impaired cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Taken together, these deficiencies can add to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best sources of omega-3 fatty acids &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/#"&gt;are fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re strictly vegan, flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts can be great alternatives. However, it’s worth noting the omega-3s in fish are absorbed better in the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.596292"&gt;than plant sources&lt;/a&gt; – and that determines how efficiently the body can use the omega-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, whole flaxseed has a tough outer shell, which makes it more difficult to digest and absorb its nutrients. But ground flaxseed has been broken down, making the omega-3s and other nutrients &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/flaxseed/faq-20058354#"&gt;more available for absorption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although alcohol may provide a sense of relaxation in the moment, it actually &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/alcohol-and-fatigue"&gt;contributes to fatigue&lt;/a&gt; after the buzz wears off. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-does-drinking-alcohol-do-to-your-body.h00-159696756.html"&gt;is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;; it forces your body to prioritize its metabolism over that of nutrients, which means the body reduces the use of carbohydrates and fat for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602002"&gt;reduces the absorption of B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, which consequently affects energy production. The bottom line: If you drink alcohol, ultimately you will feel tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet isn’t everything. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.116-a160"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/light-exercise-can-yield-significant-cognitive-benefits-new-research-shows-243559"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-resilience-a-psychologist-explains-the-main-ingredients-that-help-people-manage-stress-218323"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are all critical factors for reducing fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;can make vitamin D from sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t need a lot. A few minutes up to a half hour of sun exposure can help most people get what they need. The amount of time can vary depending on where you live, how much clothing you wear and what time of year you get the exposure. You’ll reach your vitamin D daily quota much faster on a sunny day during the summer than a cloudy day in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may sound counterintuitive, but the more you exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389"&gt;the more energy you will produce&lt;/a&gt;; working out doesn’t drain you. Instead, it boosts energy, along with mood, by improving blood flow and helping to release endorphins, which are hormones produced by the body to relieve pain or stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without exercise, the human body becomes less efficient at producing energy, which leads to lethargy. Coupled with erratic blood sugar levels – often caused by &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/worried-about-the-health-effects-of-the-sugar-in-your-breakfast-cereal-little-has-changed-since-the-days-of-unfrosted-the-pop-tarts-movie-233633"&gt;diets high in refined sugars&lt;/a&gt; and low in nutrients – these energy dips and spikes can leave you feeling irritable and drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:%7E"&gt;150 minutes of moderate exercise each week&lt;/a&gt; through activities like brisk walking, cycling, swimming and strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slsci.2014.11.001"&gt;makes things even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Not getting enough rest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;disrupts the body’s natural recovery processes&lt;/a&gt; and will leave you with diminished energy and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you should try to get &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2015.10.004"&gt;seven to nine hours of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. For some people &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/better-sleep-for-kids-starts-with-better-sleep-for-parents-especially-after-holiday-disruptions-to-routines-196110"&gt;this is not easy&lt;/a&gt;; creating a calming bedtime routine helps, and limiting screen time is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid phones, computers and other screens for at least 30 to 60 minutes before bed. The blue light emitted from screens can interfere with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;your body’s production of melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Conversely, activities like reading, meditation or gentle stretching help signal to your body that it’s time to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, there are things you can do about your fatigue. Smart choices help optimize mood, energy levels and overall health, and reduce the surges of sluggishness you feel throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: Your diet and lifestyle can make all the difference between being alert or wiped out.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241745/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241745/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Exposed people should confirm vaccination against measles, authorities said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine," said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County health officer, in the press release. "Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to others before they feel sick or have symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, the last case of measles in a Los Angeles County resident was reported in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philly, NY cases not tied to other outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Philadelphia, the measles patient is not connected to a case in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, or to outbreaks in west Texas, Oklahoma, or New Mexico. Instead, the patient was likely exposed during international travel.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles." said Philadelphia Health Commissioner Palak Raval-Nelson, PhD, MPH.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk County, New York, child, who authorities said was under the age of 5 years, represents the third measles case in New York this year. Authorities said there is no connection to ongoing outbreaks in the most recent case, and they urged New York residents to check their MMR immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles can be very serious. It's much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization. The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not," State Health Commissioner James McDonald, MD, MPH, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Late last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues a Health Alert Network notice on US measles cases and warned travelers to be cautious during upcoming spring break travel.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising cases in Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseas, meanwhile, from February 2024 to January 2025, a total of 32,265 people were diagnosed as having measles in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), a sharp jump from the 2,361 cases reported in 2023.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most cases were reported by Romania (27,568), Italy (1,097), Germany (637), Belgium (551), and Austria (542), the ECDC said in a &lt;a href="https://measles-rubella-monthly.ecdc.europa.eu/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;monthly report &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on measles and rubella.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period, Romania recorded 18 deaths attributed to measles and Ireland noted 1. Only Latvia and Liechtenstein reported zero cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there is variation in the proportion of imported cases by country, the majority of cases in the EU/EEA acquired measles through local/community transmission within the reporting country," the report states.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 32,265 patients with known age, 14,556 (45.1%) were children under 5 years; 8,721 patients (27.0%) were aged 15 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 10,886 patients ages 1 to 4 years, 82.7% were unvaccinated, 1,082 (9.9%) were vaccinated with one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, 43 (0.4%) were vaccinated with two or more doses, and 757 (7%) were vaccinated with an unknown number of doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;A safe and effective vaccine has been used for decades to prevent measles," the ECDC said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076506"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; yesterday. All EU/EEA countries recommend two MMR vaccine doses in their national immunization schedules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The surging measles outbreak, which has already sickened hundreds and hospitalized dozens in Texas and New Mexico, will get worse before it gets better. In a recent alert sent to health care providers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that it expects the deadly virus to continue to spread rapidly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s warning was provided in a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; late last week. As of Tuesday, Texas health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; 223 measles cases in the state, with 29 hospitalized and one dead as a result. Measles has also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in other states this year, including New Mexico, New York, Alaska, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak has been ongoing since mid-January. It’s largely affected people living in Mennonite communities in rural western Texas, many of whom are unvaccinated. In late February, an unvaccinated “school-aged” child in Texas died from the preventable viral disease—the first such U.S. death &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in a decade. The outbreak has also spread to neighboring regions of New Mexico, with 33 reported cases so far. In early March, New Mexico health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-measles-outbreak-tops-200-cases-as-second-death-investigated-2000573252"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a recently deceased resident tested positive for measles, though an investigation into this person’s official cause of death is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, it can quickly spread through communities with relatively low vaccination rates. Roughly 94% of a population has to be vaccinated against measles to prevent widespread transmission, a concept known as herd immunity. Very early on into the outbreak, local health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; that hundreds had already been infected, and that tally has likely gotten bigger since. Even a month ago, the outbreak was the largest seen in the state in nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago, though outbreaks have occasionally appeared in pockets of the country where vaccination rates are low (these outbreaks will usually start when an infected person travels back from a region where the disease is endemic). While the risk for widespread measles in the United States remains low, thanks to high vaccination rates nationwide, the CDC does expect the immediate situation in Texas and New Mexico to worsen. In its advisory, the CDC says the outbreak is continuing “to expand rapidly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This year, there have been measles cases reported in 13 states. On Tuesday, Oklahoma health officials &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; two cases in the state that appear to be connected to the Texas and New Mexico clusters. The cases seen elsewhere appear to be travel-related, though it is possible that further outbreaks could emerge from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, 2025’s total reported tally is well on pace to overtake the 285 measles cases reported nationwide last year. It remains to be seen whether this year will be worse than 2019, which featured widespread and sustained outbreaks in parts of New York that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-u-s-is-officially-free-of-measles-for-now-1838776475"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to strip away the country’s official status of having eliminated measles on a local level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest outbreaks have occurred under the watch of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the new head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Though Kennedy has expressed some support for measles vaccination since taking over the HHS, he has a long track record of spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.

At least 12 states have measles cases linked to international travel, per the CDC. People can be exposed to measles in countries where the virus is endemic and bring it home, where numbers spread due to lack of vaccination, per health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the Texas outbreak, though, it’s not known how many have not been vaccinated. And five of those who got measles said they’d had at least one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those who were born before 1957 and likely had measles already, as well as those who have received both vaccine doses, are not believed to be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But measles is extremely contagious, so health experts estimate that 90% of those who did not get vaccinated or have natural immunity and are exposed will develop the fever, rash and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles is also a disease that works directly on the immune system, creating what has been dubbed “immune amnesia.” As &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/07/measles-immune-amnesia-raise-risk-other-ills/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/07/measles-immune-amnesia-raise-risk-other-ills/"&gt;Deseret News&lt;/a&gt; earlier reported, measles infection can wipe the immune system’s memory that it has had other illnesses, making it susceptible to future infection with those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Highly contagious, people can pass the virus on before symptoms appear, so they don’t know they have it. And it’s spread through air when someone with measles coughs, sneezes or otherwise disperses virus into the air. To add to the risk, that air can stay contaminated for at least a couple of hours, exposing others who have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That was the story in the East, where health officials announced that anyone passing through parts of Terminal A at Dulles International Airport on March 5 might have been exposed to measles, as &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/10/measles-maryland-traveler-dulles-passengers-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/10/measles-maryland-traveler-dulles-passengers-exposed/"&gt;Deseret News reported&lt;/a&gt;. An international traveler ended up at the hospital two days later in the emergency department, where measles was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And this week, Philadelphia officials are warning of potential exposures to measles at several health facilities last week. An individual was exposed to measles during international travel and visited the South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, which houses a children’s primary care unit and part of the health department, as well as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia emergency room, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/measles-philadelphia-exposure-chop-health-department/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/measles-philadelphia-exposure-chop-health-department/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="8350" data-height="5567"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BHEGTFNLD5EPZOXMGIRG6Q3LFQ.jpg?auth=e901ff1a8732bb52048dde1fba932e8db56cf2ba014484b9f8f1284feaffdb27&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BHEGTFNLD5EPZOXMGIRG6Q3LFQ.jpg?auth=e901ff1a8732bb52048dde1fba932e8db56cf2ba014484b9f8f1284feaffdb27&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Fernando Tarin, left, of Seagraves, Texas, and his mother Josie Granado wear face masks after being tested for measles at a mobile testing site outside Seminole Hospital District Friday, Feb. 21, 2025, in Seminole, Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Julio Cortez, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Tips-to-avoid-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Tips to avoid measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The concern is nationwide. Health officials in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a press release recently urging residents to check their immunization records or talk to their health care providers to see if they are adequately vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah, people can learn that status by visiting &lt;a href="https://utah.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed508d0fee9a2d592f5274e9c&amp;amp;id=5e61ac9f0d&amp;amp;e=76993c1c8c" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;https://immunize.utah.gov/usiis-parents-individuals/&lt;/a&gt;. They can also look at their immunization records in the &lt;a href="https://utah.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed508d0fee9a2d592f5274e9c&amp;amp;id=f37bf9614c&amp;amp;e=76993c1c8c" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Docket app or website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per that notice, “A person who has measles can spread the illness to others even before they have symptoms. Most people will have mild illnesses like fever, rash, diarrhea, or ear infection. Measles can also cause pneumonia, encephalitis (brain infection), seizures, and even death. Young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems are especially at risk of severe complications from measles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Asim Cheema, internal medicine and cardiology physician at &lt;a href="https://yourdoctors.online/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Your Doctors Online&lt;/a&gt;, provided advice for parents on how to keep their children and themselves safe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce exposure, especially for those too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For those who are exposed, Cheema recommends monitoring symptoms for up to two weeks and isolating if needed. It’s also important to call ahead before visiting a doctor if measles is suspected to avoid exposing anyone else at the clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The virus doesn’t discriminate — it will find and infect susceptible individuals regardless of age or health status. The current measles resurgence represents a critical public health challenge,” Cheema said in a written statement, noting possible complications that include pneumonia, brain swelling and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others note that measles can cause vision and hearing damage and developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas Rupp of the Salt Lake County Health Department told Deseret News that students who are under- or unvaccinated with confirmed exposure to measles can be excluded from school and told to quarantine for up to 21 days to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If they are confirmed exposed, yes, under- and unvaccinated students will need to quarantine at home for 21 days to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The only exception is if the exposed student receives post-exposure prophylaxis (which for measles is MMR vaccine) within three days of the exposure,” he said. “Given that people with measles are contagious up to four days before the telltale rash appears, the three-day window can be challenging to meet since the original patient may not know they have measles and not just a cold until after that window has passed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNam80V01kcVEyUHktbHVHU3V4OFNRN3VJN0dOMFJxRW1xc3VlTjJwb2doRDdreUVDdmZWdm9pRXFyYUJXVFhLUGVFbXpHa0pXRWRIUkFEUUMwdDJFTjZIZk5QRTZHUDJOVUlhQXlmYl9WNi1RN3FCNTBfQTI5b2x4TWJYYzBiM1lHQ0tteFNmQW4yN3VQNFpQSnZfUXlSakZ3TkJJMWhCaEZLZm5vdFFrODlkZw</guid></item><item><title>A premotor cortical network in the brain allows people to voluntarily stop speaking, study suggests - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOQUJ5R3p0NWtjQk9NZFRkU1RpcExXMTgzMVVib1hiWjRiNlVrcGtYY1Q4RzNnQmk3Q1o2Wm0zU2doMnljaUhXTUVSUVYzYnYtaTAzNC1XdU9KZ0w1YVNKZ0NrWUpFcFJ6bE9MZVgyQjlNNUFzcmswU014LThmWThIeDdHSFJGTFF3dGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech is a unique human ability that is known to be supported by various motor and cognitive processes. When humans start speaking, they can decide to cease at any point; for instance, if they are interrupted by something happening or by another person speaking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The ability to voluntarily stop speaking plays a central role in social interactions, as it allows people to engage in conversations with others while adaptively responding to social cues, environmental stimuli or interruptions. While many past studies explored the neural and cognitive underpinnings of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/speech/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; itself, the brain processes associated with speech inhibition remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Francisco recently set out to better understand how the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt; controls the ceasing of speech using tools to record neurophysiological signals. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02118-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, unveils a previously unknown premotor cortical network that could support voluntary speech inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The cognitive and neural mechanisms of speech inhibition are not well understood," wrote Lingyun Zhao, Alexander B. Silva and their colleagues in their paper. "We have recorded direct high-density cortical activity while participants engaged in continuous speech production and were visually cued to stop speaking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the neural underpinnings of voluntary speech cessation, Zhao, Silva and their colleagues used a neurophysiological recording technique known as high-density electrocorticography (ECoG). This technique allows researchers to monitor the electrical activity originating from the surface of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They recruited 13 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant epilepsy who had electrodes implanted on their brains' surfaces to better understand the brain regions that contribute to their epileptic seizures. These patients were asked to complete a speech-stopping task, which asked them to follow instructions on when to start and stop speaking, while their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neural recordings revealed distinct activity in the premotor frontal cortex correlated with stopping speech," wrote the researchers. "This activity was found in largely separate cortical sites from regions encoding vocal tract articulatory movements. Moreover, this activity primarily occurred with abrupt stopping in the middle of an utterance, rather than naturally completing a phrase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings gathered by this team of researchers hint at the existence of a specialized brain mechanism that supports the voluntary control of speech. Zhao, Silva and their colleagues conducted further tests aimed at validating the existence of this mechanism by stimulating specific parts of the premotor frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Electrocortical stimulation at many premotor sites with inhibitory stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, which contradicts previous clinical interpretations of this effect as evidence for critical centers of speech production," wrote the team. "Together, these results suggest a previously unknown premotor cortical network that supports the inhibitory control of speech, providing implications for understanding both natural and altered speech production."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this study suggest that the human ability to voluntarily stop speech is supported by a particular inhibitory control neural network that had not been uncovered before. Future studies could help to further elucidate the functions and contributions of the newly identified premotor cortical network, which could in turn help to better understand some disorders linked to an impaired ability to voluntarily control speech.&lt;/p&gt;
