					&lt;p&gt;A person has tested positive for &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; after possibly being bitten by an infected flea while camping in South Lake Tahoe, according to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Dorado County’s public health division announced the positive plague case on Tuesday and stated that the individual is currently under the care of a medical professional while recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s acting director of public health, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other information about the person or their condition was released but health officials said they are investigating the situation.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, and plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bites of fleas that have acquired them from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents, according to El Dorado County’s public health division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into people’s homes and warn that people can get the disease when they are bitten by infected fleas. Plague can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild rodents and keeping pets away from rodent burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-video-id="7184442" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/7184442/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

				&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say symptoms of plague usually show up within two weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes.

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague, which spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs. Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare in humans, with an average of about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the current case, the most recently reported case of human plague in El Dorado County was in 2020, and the person was likely exposed in the South Lake Tahoe area. Two people were also reported to have plague in 2015 after being exposed to infected rodents or fleas in Yosemite National Park. Both individuals were treated and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from pneumonic plague. The death in Coconino County was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said. Further details, including the identity of the victim, were not released.&lt;/p&gt;

They are currently used to treat a number of conditions including heart failure, high blood pressure and sometimes anxiety &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michelle Halls, senior author of the study and an expert in drug discovery biology at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, said the findings were exciting as they confirmed the potential link between beta blockers and tumour progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our colleagues previously found that beta blockers are associated with a significant reduction in mortality in people with triple negative breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we have a much better grasp on why this could be the case,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Terrance Lam, a pharmaceutical PhD candidate at the institute and co-author, added: 'Our collective research strongly suggests that HOXC12 is a potential new indicator for when triple negative breast cancer patients could respond to beta blocker targeted interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive cancer which can be especially challenging to treat and identifying new treatment pathways are important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are now calling for further studies to 'urgently' determine whether the gene can be used at diagnosis to identify patients who will benefit from beta blocker therapy—and stop their cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta blockers, commonly prescribed to lower blood pressure, work mainly by slowing the heart and blocking the action of stress hormones such as adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study, published in Science Signaling, there is a strong correlation between activation of the beta-2 adrenoceptor and accelerated cancer spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that patients with high levels of HOXC12 expression in women with this form of cancer were associated with poorer overall survival outcomes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in seven women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime—around 56,000 a year—making it the most common cancer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer survive for more than five years following their diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, triple negative breast cancer—which accounts for around 15 per cent of all breast cancers in the UK and US—is far more challenging to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, it grows and spreads faster than other breast cancer types and has fewer treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One reason for this is because it doesn't interact with hormones such as oestrogen in the same way as other breast cancers—for which there are targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average around 77 per cent of women with triple negative breast cancer will survive their cancer for five years or more after they are diagnosed, but depending on the stage this can fall as low as 12 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is compared to around 90 per cent of women with other forms of breast cancer who will survive for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A low-FODMAP diet involves cutting down on sugars, refined starchy carbohydrates and dairy products which can promote fermentation in the gut and opting for low-FODMAP alternatives &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Removing high FODMAP foods can give your gut lining a chance to repair itself and restore a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria, easing symptoms of IBS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best low-FODMAP alternatives include non-fermentable vegetables such as aubergines and potatoes, low-fructose fruits like grapes, kiwis and oranges and protein-rich eggs, tofu and seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1615671/full"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;researchers at the Haukeland University Hospital, Norway, investigated the impact of a low FODMAP diet on levels of GLP-1—a hormone released in the gut after eating that has been linked with IBS—in patients with the painful condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers studied 30 adult patients with mixed type IBS—when sufferers tend to experience alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-97962260-7e8e-11f0-ab9a-e36032aef9e7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15021193/diet-cure-IBS-indigestion-fodmap-gut-glp.html"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned that low doses of ionizing radiation could increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171752" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at an individual level, the theoretical risk of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very low&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all. Patients should not hesitate to undergo these tests if they are considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed annually in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-viral-cause-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-common-cancers"&gt;Scientists Discover a Viral Cause of One of The World's Most Common Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in April, a team in the US and the UK predicted that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radioactive-waste-exposed-children-in-missouri-to-cancer-risks-study-finds"&gt;risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg" alt="A patient undergoing a CT scan, with a technician present" class="size-medium wp-image-171762" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The theoretical risks of CT scans must be weighed against the benefits.

Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;acknowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.

She argues it is important to avoid unnecessary CT scans if radiation-free procedures can do the same job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiographer Naomi Gibson, President of the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the findings highlight the need for vigilance around long-term radiation exposure, this should not discourage the use of CT imaging when clinically justified," Gibson &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In appropriately selected cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic value of CT scans significantly outweighs the potential radiation-associated risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in April 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures of the deer with strange clusters of blisters on their flesh have been uploaded to social media from across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubbles have been sprouting all over the animals' bodies - pulling them out of shape from their legs to their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past two months, wildlife watchers have documented unsettling cases in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials were quick to identify the condition as deer cutaneous fibroma - better known as "deer warts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by a virus that spreads between the deer - and experts have warned of an outbreak this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often spread by disease-carrying insects, like mosquitos and tics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pass on the virus by transferring the blood of infected animals into healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease-carrying insects breed in warm weather, which is why there are more wart-ridden deer in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said: "Papillomas are most frequently seen during the late summer and into the fall, probably due to increased biting insect activity during this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer are not the only mutated animals that have been startling Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6376889967112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="JZ81AsHszB"

the lesions or saliva on those that are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus affecting the deer is from the same broad family as one that can infect humans - known as papillomaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can suffer from similar growths on their skin if infected by the human version of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't any danger of a person

First, researchers tested nasal swabs, which can paint a partial picture of infection, but not a full one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always have to remember when we look at things like the levels of the COVID virus in a nasal swab ... that’s not the level of the virus in the lung or in the person’s body,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re using the nasal swab as a surrogate, a placeholder, a peek at what might be happening in the body, but it’s not a true picture of that, so we have to be a little cautious about interpreting it,” Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, since nasal swabs were collected every two weeks, participants may have gotten sick and then recovered from viruses like COVID-19 and rhinovirus in that time frame. Meaning, there may have been infections and subsequent virus protections that weren’t accounted for by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This does not mean that you’re totally protected from COVID-19 if you’ve had a recent cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, t&lt;span&gt;his is not reason enough to expose yourself to someone with a cold. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you didn’t get SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t mean you’re healthier,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having repeated infections and becoming more resistant to other viruses isn’t necessarily a good thing, Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could develop asthma as a result of these infections, he noted, along with other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know in the long term whether this kind of immunity might be a good thing because you’re protected or whether it might have a downside as well,” Ray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing to note is, while this is exciting and interesting, the immune system and immune function is very complex, so I would hesitate to make any strong generalizations,” added Mieses Malchuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about your immune system and your virus exposure, you should talk to your doctor, Mieses Malchuk noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, there are things you can do that actually can protect you from getting COVID.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned a lot of things during the last few years, and we’re still learning, but there are recommendations for the use of vaccines that we should follow, and vaccines are still a safer way to gain immunity to a virus than infection with that virus,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Updated COVID shots for 2025-2026 are expected to be available soon.

The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs’ — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping cortical plasticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain’s map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven’t had for decades,’” Schone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map’ showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01312-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02686-5/d41586-025-02686-5_25418070.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Famous ‘homunculus’ brain map redrawn to include complex movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the brain’s representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain’s in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Aging can bring changes to people's bodies, minds and relationships — changes that many are often not prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Erlene Rosowsky, a clinical psychologist who &lt;a href="https://erlenepsyd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;specializes in aging&lt;/a&gt;, says many people don't see these changes coming because society is obsessed with youth. The emphasis is on all things "anti-aging," she says — not the realities of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of ageism in society, which bolsters the illusion of control and avoiding it," Rosowsky says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But once people begin to experience some of the realities of aging, they may find that younger folks don't really get it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, my mom, then in her early 80s, was given a slate of knee exercises to do to keep her mobile. "I've realized I'll have to do these exercises for the rest of my life!" she announced. "I didn't know being old would be so much &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Aging was work? I'd never thought about it that way. Then I realized that if, like her, I'd never much enjoyed exercise to begin with, and someone told me I had to start a daily regimen when I was already stiff and in pain, I'd dread it too. But she applied herself and is still doing the exercises today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky, who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;herself is 82, says it's not just that changes to health, cognitive abilities and mobility crop up as people age. One's sense of self often changes as people leave a longtime career and relationships alter as friends move away or die. But, she says, people can adjust. Rosowsky says her body "doesn't look the way I remember it because I'm an older person," but she doesn't get hung up on it. She used to love cross-country skiing but no longer takes to the trails. She retired from teaching at a university but still researches and writes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83513" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Arielou Marcy is 86 and has weathered some major changes recently. She lives in Lynchburg, Va., and lost her husband of 62 years a couple of years ago. Living without him has been a huge adjustment. However, Marcy lives with one of her daughters, two dogs and four cats, and she says she also has good neighbors and friends. These humans and animals keep her motivated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The most aggravating change she deals with on a daily basis is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15837-scoliosis" target="_blank"&gt;scoliosis&lt;/a&gt; — curvature of the spine. Instead of standing upright, "I go east to west," says Marcy. The condition alters her gait, and sometimes it just hurts. "It's driving me nuts," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, she doesn't want scoliosis to define her life. She takes a few over-the-counter painkillers a day, goes to physical therapy twice a week and continues to attend the yoga classes she has been going to for years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also stays focused on the things she has, not those she lacks. "Be ever grateful for the things you can do," she says. "Don't keep thinking, 'Oh, I used to be able to do that.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says living with one of her children helps keep her positive. "I have purpose," she says, in being there for her daughter when she gets home from work and helping to keep the house and pets cared for. The two of them are close.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But adult child-older parent relationships can be riddled with exasperation on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It can be hard for adult children to understand what their parents are going through as they age, because they haven't gone through it themselves. Parents may feel that lack of empathy keenly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How adult children can help parents adjust to change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky says there are several ways adult children can help aging parents adjust to life's vicissitudes. This may involve an attitude tweak on the child's part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, slow down and listen, Rosowsky says. Listening is the most important thing an adult child can do for an older parent, but middle-aged offspring are busy and rushed. For anyone on a short visit, she says, why not ask your parent how you can best spend your time with them? And if a parent is struggling with a change to their health, for instance, she suggests saying something like, "I'm seeing this might be hard for you. Is that what you're feeling?" She says there is often a gap between what the adult child thinks a parent needs and what that parent feels they need.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another thing children may try to oversee is a parent's diet. Many people end up having to alter their diets as they get older. But there's a difference between helping a parent stay on track with a new regime and bludgeoning them with reminders. Rosowsky says by all means make sure Mom or Dad has the information they need about whatever they're supposed to consume and avoid. But if they keep returning to a bag of Cheetos, curb your exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As long as a parent is competent to make decisions, they're competent to make lousy decisions or decisions you wouldn't make," she says. She adds that the mission of the child is to keep their parent safe and healthy. The older adult, though, "doesn't want to be wrapped up." Rather, they want to maintain their sense of autonomy and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, Rosowsky says, ask your parent to tell stories. In some of her past work in nursing homes, she saw a lot of physically frail people receiving intimate care from staff — the kind of care that felt humiliating to the recipient. It was a big, unwelcome change to their daily existence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when the staff member asked the older adult to tell them a story about their life, it altered the dynamic. "The communication went much better," she says, as the older person wasn't a helpless resident being tended to. By telling a story, she says — by giving something — the older adult became an equal part of the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes knowing what "should" be done collides with the reality of what one actually gets around to doing. Arielou Marcy is resisting the pressure she feels to make changes to her longtime home — to purge the house of clutter because doing so will, she's told, make things easier for her children after she's gone.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Why should I get rid of all the things I love that I've had throughout my life?" she asks, pointing out an old rocking horse that used to belong to her husband as a child, a teacup from her grandmother and artwork made by her daughters, who are now in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Much of the time she's happy to adjust, she says. But sometimes, she's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to follow suit, limiting its recommendation on who should get the shots to the same groups. (The CDC currently recommends Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change, experts say, could affect what insurers are willing to cover for everyone else &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/updated-covid-vaccines-fall-may-jeopardy-rfk-jrs-new-rules-rcna204242" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:who doesn’t fall under a high-risk group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;who doesn’t fall under a high-risk group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By law, most health insurance plans are required to fully cover vaccines recommended by the CDC and its outside advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t fall under the CDC’s new recommendations, experts say coverage would depend entirely on their insurance — with some deciding to fully cover the shot, others requiring a copay and some not covering it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without insurance, a Covid shot can cost up to $140, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC’s vaccine price list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the CDC’s vaccine price list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could very well get confusing,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and an adviser to ACIP. Whether you’re able to get a free shot “may greatly depend on which company with which you have your insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who can get a Covid vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the expected recommendations from the CDC, healthy children and adults won’t be barred from getting the Covid vaccine, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at UC Law San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s legal to give a vaccine off-label,” Reiss said, referring to when a doctor prescribes a drug for something different than what the FDA approved it for, “and insurance companies can choose to cover them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for AHIP, a health insurance industry trade group, said that every individual insurer will come up with its own policy following the CDC’s final guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:list of conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;list of conditions&lt;/a&gt; that put a person at high risk for severe illness from Covid is extensive, and includes cancer, heart disease and lung conditions as well as physical inactivity and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers also take into account clinical recommendations from outside medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the AAP, which has expressed its disapproval for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s vaccine decisions, released its own recommendations supporting Covid vaccinations for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are also unlikely to notice changes to their insurance coverage overnight — if there are any, according to the AHIP spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For private plans — including Obamacare plans — any changes stemming from ACIP meetings could likely only be implemented in the next benefit year, typically Jan. 1, the spokesperson said. That means it’s possible that people who get a shot before then might be covered. Medicare and Medicaid plans are required to follow ACIP recommendations immediately upon the CDC director’s signature. Covid vaccines have also already been factored into insurers’ plans for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Blue Cross and Blue Shield said that “each independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan will make their own coverage decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Aetna said pregnant women and children will be able to get the new Covid booster this fall and winter with no copay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults who get Aetna coverage through their jobs might have different coverage, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if that means they’ll have to pay or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Covid and flu shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes could affect people planning to get their Covid and flu vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said some people choose to get their Covid and flu shots at the same time, but there are concerns that some could be turned away due to the anticpated change in recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that misinformation about who is able to get the Covid shots may also discourage people from getting either vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we have to reassure people, particularly those at high risk, that the vaccine will be available to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick Gates, Walgreens’ chief pharmacy officer, said its pharmacists usually determine whether a patient has coverage before a vaccine is administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it’s unlikely anyone would be hit with a surprise bill due to new CDC recommendations, he said, adding that the patient would first be told whether the vaccine is fully covered, a copay is required or the patient must pay entirely out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said that people are already coming in for their flu shot, but many seem to be holding off on the Covid shot until the updated version is available. During last year’s respiratory virus season peak, he said, more than 50% of patients got both shots at once — a number that has grown over the past two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:14:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5XMlAxNGZfM3JIdmZKS2ZTVXV0a2tsVThKc3dWRDZyMjhxT0ttdkdzRlczRGpRSUIzZ0MyM3NzcFdFV2NQNW5PNFh0dHplNHhSRXcxb3JoRXdNaXNrZ1RXanNvWERhRlgxWE0wQg</guid></item><item><title>对于某些人来说，秋季新冠肺炎疫苗注射可能会自付—或者根本没有报道- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOWgwR29Kb1BpN2VMQmlaeEdYQko5M0IwejZXRUZsa1VCVGNudHlHUjU1SkVnWjRvclQyRkp1cE9ISXphSHNvNk96OVRLNWlobXpDb0h3VWVfRGh6ZDFOY3B6T0FYZy00a3JmbTlSc0phdUdnVl8yeG9NZnpQbGZoUGtVSGFRUEdQbTh4enEyMGtLcTgzS2tveTgtanBFNkhh0gFWQVVfeXFMUFFkXzlCcGZTUkZNWUFQQ2prU1pJU250R2FSNXZNYUJOc3preXpLQTRoX25ULWpTdFdDSzJacDFNT2liVFpIbDQxUWlHbU5LNXROYlRxakE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-61cbef" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re in good health and plan to get a Covid shot this fall, you might end up with an unwelcome surprise: a bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b1267" class="body-graf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the next round of Covid shots soon, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccines-fda-trials-delay-kids-adults-fall-rcna207718"&gt;but only for a smaller, high-risk group&lt;/a&gt; — adults 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions.

During last year’s respiratory virus season peak, he said, more than 50% of patients got both shots at once — a number that has grown over the past two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOWgwR29Kb1BpN2VMQmlaeEdYQko5M0IwejZXRUZsa1VCVGNudHlHUjU1SkVnWjRvclQyRkp1cE9ISXphSHNvNk96OVRLNWlobXpDb0h3VWVfRGh6ZDFOY3B6T0FYZy00a3JmbTlSc0phdUdnVl8yeG9NZnpQbGZoUGtVSGFRUEdQbTh4enEyMGtLcTgzS2tveTgtanBFNkhh0gFWQVVfeXFMUFFkXzlCcGZTUkZNWUFQQ2prU1pJU250R2FSNXZNYUJOc3preXpLQTRoX25ULWpTdFdDSzJacDFNT2liVFpIbDQxUWlHbU5LNXROYlRxakE</guid></item><item><title>长跑可以降低患结肠癌的风险；了解研究结果-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigJBVV95cUxPa29zai1pZGFiaHBCYzZfal9SY0xMQWxHN3FCemdwSHpRcUhCOW44T05DdDZPNWNyNjdxMXpBQ2NyWXZ3SF8xVFpQOUNoRHRiZnlVbmVTZnRPWWNzdkFmTmNrVVFxZmJqQmFha3U5X1ZHYVBhMFNnbm1MVGpSbHhPTFNOZE9EcjlaWnotMVdwVWZhbmR5YWttM1hsTGI0ZHlUb2w2ZE85UU54SE1yanJaQldKZTk5R1l5cDZPV2NoX1JUcWJDYnd1dzNtZ1o0alVjcXJMeHR0YjZia1JXSmxVLXEwRnZzaWpwU0JxLUtGSzI3TGdybWZJS0I3V3plQkZXZWtmMUx0UUZmdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running is widely celebrated for its numerous health benefits, including boosting cardiovascular fitness, enhancing mental well-being, and supporting weight management. Beyond these advantages, regular running plays a vital role in lowering the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and notably, colon cancer. By promoting healthy digestion, reducing inflammation, improving gut motility, supporting immune function, and aiding in weight control, running helps protect the colon from harmful changes that can lead to cancer. Incorporating consistent running or jogging into your lifestyle is a powerful, natural way to improve overall health and significantly reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marathon running may influence colon cancer development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/press-release/2025/08/groundbreaking-inova-study-finds-potential-link-between-long-distance-running-and-colon-cancer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Inova Schar Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found a possible link between long-distance running and a higher risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults. The study looked at 100 runners aged 35 to 50 who had completed multiple marathons or ultramarathons. Results showed that 15% had advanced adenomas ( a type of colon polyp that has a higher risk of turning into colon cancer if left untreated), which is much higher than the usual 1-2% seen in the general population. This suggests that intense long-distance running might increase the risk of colorectal cancer, emphasising the need for more research and earlier cancer screening for endurance athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Running as a protective factor against colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous large-scale studies have confirmed that regular physical activity, including running, significantly reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise improves digestive health by enhancing gut motility, which helps prevent the buildup of carcinogens in the colon. Furthermore, running boosts the immune system and reduces chronic inflammation, both important factors in cancer prevention. Marathon training may also regulate hormone levels, reduce insulin resistance, and promote beneficial gut bacteria, contributing further to long-term colon health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How marathon running lowers colon cancer risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved digestion: Running stimulates bowel movements, reducing the time harmful substances stay in contact with the colon lining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced inflammation: Chronic inflammation is a key driver of cancer development. Running lowers inflammatory markers in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight through regular running decreases obesity-related cancer risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormonal balance: Physical activity helps regulate hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors, which, when imbalanced, can promote tumour growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="25627620" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="exercise-and-colon-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Exercise and colon cancer&lt;/keyword&gt; survivors: Enhancing recovery and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is equally beneficial for those who have been diagnosed with colon cancer.

A recent small study suggested an increased risk in extreme endurance runners, but broader research strongly supports exercise as protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2: Should I stop running if I’m worried about colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Exercise remains vital for overall health. Discuss your concerns and screening options with a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3: What are colon polyps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon polyps are growths on the lining of the colon that can sometimes develop into cancer if left untreated. Regular screening can detect and remove them early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4: How often should I get screened for colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening recommendations vary by age, family history, and risk factors.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOISE, Idaho — Idaho Health officials confirmed a third case of measles in an Idaho resident Wednesday, raising concerns about community transmission of the highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case of confirmed infection was in an unvaccinated child in Bonner County, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Panhandle Health District. Officials said there is no known connection between this case and the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/idaho-panhandle-health-district-first-measles-1991/293-6ad73a7a-88bf-4c30-8f4e-4bf16494cf63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;first reported case in Kootenai County&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, the second case was reported in &lt;a href="/article/news/local/bonneville-county-first-measles-case-since-1991/277-caf92ef1-eb2f-429c-8922-297193e0d0cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Bonneville County last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it's reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating," said Dr. Christine Hahn, state epidemiologist and Division of Public Health medical director, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three confirmed cases involve an unvaccinated child.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hahn warned that cases could multiply quickly, as seen in other states nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. Patients remain contagious from four days before until four days after the characteristic rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/local/an-international-traveler-with-measles-visited-multiple-idaho-locations-during-infectious-period-outbreak/277-78f9f25d-bece-4303-9218-0ddc22204e8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Symptoms include &lt;/a&gt;fever, runny nose, cough and rash. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panhandle Health District states that while many recover without complications, "measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Among measles cases, typically 13% will need hospitalization, and among young children that percent jumps to 21%," Dr. Hahn said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging the public to check their vaccination records through their primary health provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, have had a confirmed case of measles or were born before 1957 are considered immune to the measles virus. Idaho health officials said the MMR vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, people who may have been exposed should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider. Those experiencing measles symptoms should call ahead before visiting medical facilities to allow staff to prepare isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

And yet, deficiencies are not uncommon: 35% of adults in the United States are deficient in vitamin D, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, while even more are likely getting some but still less than they should. Despite everything that vitamin D does and the benefits it provides, it can be hard to tell if you're actually deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most symptoms are vague and can be easily overlooked,” said &lt;a href="https://heathermangieri.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports and wellness dietitian in Pittsburgh. “As a sports dietitian, I get concerned about a vitamin D deficiency when I see an athlete complaining of fatigue, bone pain, muscle aches, or presenting with multiple bone fractures or injuries.” Other common symptoms of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt; including muscle weakness and mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://heathermangieri.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports and wellness dietitian in Pittsburgh; &lt;a href="https://www.knsdietitians.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Kidney Nutrition Specialists in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do you need adequate amounts of vitamin D to avoid these symptoms, but getting enough can also help you reap all the health benefits this powerful vitamin has to offer. Here, dietitians shared how vitamin D works in the body, plus the benefits it delivers and how to make sure you're getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does vitamin D work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is both a nutrient and acts as a hormone,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.knsdietitians.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Kidney Nutrition Specialists in Seattle. Its main function is to help the body absorb and regulate calcium and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002424.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phosphorous;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phosphorous&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring they’re available to strengthen bones and teeth, she added. It also aids in the absorption of magnesium, which supports muscle and nerve function as well as energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D boosts the immune system, too, by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, a molecule that signals inflammation, explained Mangieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of vitamin D—vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 naturally occurs in some plants, whereas vitamin D3 is found in some animals and produced by human skin via sunlight exposure, per the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. Mangieri explained that D3 is considered the more potent form of the vitamin because it “has been shown to raise levels higher and for a longer period of time than D2.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research continues to uncover how crucial vitamin D is to overall health. “It’s involved in many metabolic pathways and scientists continue to investigate its role in heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a37271432/depression-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple sclerosis, among others,” added Mangieri. With that being said, here are some of the ways proper vitamin D levels can improve your overall well-being:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong bones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vitamin D deficiency, especially in older people, increases the risk of fractures and fosters overall weak and soft bones, Prest explained. “This condition is called osteomalacia and can cause bone deformities, pain, seizures from low blood calcium levels, muscle spasms, and dental abnormalities,” she added. A review published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8396272/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Molecular Sciences;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that vitamin D deficiency can induce osteomalacia plus increase your risk of developing osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its ability to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164284/#:~:text=It%20is%20widely%20thought%20that,of%20many%20immune%2Drelated%20diseases." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D has been found to help the immune system overcome bacterial and viral infections like pneumonia and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120305311" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:even COVID-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;even COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, according to research in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7281985/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, data has linked vitamin D deficiency to defective functioning of the immune system, an increased risk of infections, and a predisposition to developing autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with heart disease and cardiovascular disease-related mortality. Researchers writing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(20)30700-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;explain that vitamin D helps to regulate blood pressure, plus acts on several mechanisms that keep heart disease risk low. So far, studies have not found an explicit benefit of taking high doses of vitamin D to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/vitamin-d-heart-health-where-benefits-begin-and-end" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;, but experts say it's still important to make sure you're getting the recommended daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D has been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970300/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientifically linked to depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientifically linked to depression&lt;/a&gt;, and vitamin D supplements are sometimes used to treat it. A 2022 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9376678/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that use of vitamin D reduced the incidence of depression and improved the results of depression treatment, especially for women and people who were previously deficient in the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is ongoing, but one recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002604952500109X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Metabolism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that people who took vitamin D had increased muscle mass and muscle strength compared to a control group. The researchers suspect that vitamin D helps regulate protein synthesis and block the pathways that prompt sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get enough vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to get vitamin D: From food, from the sun, and from supplements. “Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, and trout, as well as fish liver oils, are among the best natural sources of vitamin D,” said Mangieri. “Cheese, egg yolks, beef liver, and mushrooms also have small amounts.” Other foods like milk, yogurt, cereal, and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin D, meaning the nutrient is added in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to get enough vitamin D from foods alone,” Prest admitted. “We need to consume vitamin D and get some exposure to the sun to make sure we have an adequate supply available for our body to use.” With that being said, soaking up the sun isn’t always easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cloud coverage, season, distance from the equator, pollution, skin pigmentation, age, and wearing sunblock can all impact how much vitamin D your body is able to produce,” explained Mangieri. Plus, there’s the danger of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangieri added that the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily vitamin D intake for children and adults of 600 to 800 international units (IU). “While I fully encourage a food-first approach,” she said, “when it comes to Vitamin D, a dietary supplement is often needed.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 in supplement form. Vitamin D2 supplements are made by exposing the ergosterol in yeast to UV radiation, explained Prest, and vitamin D3 supplements come from the exposure of 7-dehydrocholesterol—obtained from lanolin in the wool of sheep—to UV radiation. “There is also an animal-free version of vitamin D3 made from lichen,” she added, which comes from algae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people following a vegan diet or avoiding certain animal products, they can contact the dietary supplement manufacturer to ask about the product’s ingredients, and how it was sourced and processed,” said Prest. It’s also important to note that vitamins and supplements aren’t FDA-regulated. If you need one, Prest recommended looking for a standalone vitamin D supplement versus a multi-vitamin to ensure you get enough of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for brands with the USP verification mark on the label or that have been third-party tested through programs like &lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=861943c2f1d2a67ad6ecc4583&amp;amp;id=0c85598e47&amp;amp;e=53e1cbc321" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SF Certified for Sport;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt; or Informed Choice,” Mangieri added. “By choosing supplements with these labels, you know that what is on the label is actually present in the product in the amounts stated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Mangieri suggested having a conversation with your doctor or a registered dietitian before starting the supplement. A professional, she said, can help determine how much you should take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:47:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9QY0xQc3l6cU9XTzNfNGZ6S3NRSy1PdE1NUDItR3pDdEc0MkE0TDN5YlVLN25zZEx2cDdmY0FZdDJIbkVlYzJKc2FveVZzb216ZXBZSGxqSWtoWU91bkQ0Y00wU19lTXg5VjRBSnJ3</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性，可能来自跳蚤叮咬：卫生官员- ABC7洛杉矶</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPd01KSjhVcVlJenBqNlMyZnFtbGpTcTVZU25iSE9HNXBoekhMNndQOU8yM042VlVEREpMRXg3SlBlZEhZNGljWFhnb2NPTzI0U0ExNnRUZnJILWswaXM1azZXbUJUaWlZeURUS1VCVi1UMVFxcGxWWUFxX201WjM3cHhvNGs0UlJjNGNBRklBV3Q1RUhDeEdEbWZYdkFZQ1J6RlFhYzlKT2o4Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxNcUlqNFI2V2ozWnlrVjB2ZTVuVmF1RU5GVWROTHZoUVlfbTl5SVZteWJMUHNPWUFfMUNBYUJhWWdzRmxrSnpsRVZ0TkJhVHJCY3JZcExrQlVvT0oxQnp2ZXR2RmpVUXBkM1VRaGVVTHRwWGtlNjJONl9ydjlZVTJLQU42bEw0LUQ2Z3BKNk5QVU1HMkdRaTVsT1htb0dhLXZiWG8xNUc5Wm5IdVdfYUhJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="theme-e FITT_Article_main__body oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"&gt;&lt;div class="dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv "&gt;&lt;p class="kCTVx qtHut lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="vMjAx eeTZd tntuS eHrJ "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;South Lake Tahoe resident tests positive for plague, likely from flea bite: health officials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="QHblV nkdHX mHUQ kvZxL hTosT whbOj " data-testid="prism-byline"&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH BQWr OcxMG oJce "&gt;&lt;div class="kKfXc ubAkB VZTD rEPuv "&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH gpiba "&gt;&lt;p class="jTKbV zIIsP ZdbeE xAPpq QtiLO JQYD "&gt;Wednesday, August 20, 2025 8:15PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="LeadVideoWrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="ScrollSpy_container"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague, health officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="XQpSH " data-testid="prism-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;SAN FRANCISCO -- &lt;/span&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.kcra.com/article/south-lake-tahoe-resident-tests-positive-for-plague/65824589" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;tested positive for the plague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Obviously, it's nowhere near as dangerous as it was centuries ago, but officials warn it still needs to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/post/south-lake-tahoe-resident-tests-positive-bubonic-plague-infectious-disease-experts-explain-what-know/17599568/"&gt;What to know about plague after South Lake Tahoe resident tests positive for disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials in El Dorado County believe the person got it from a flea bite while camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Human plague cases are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC says an average of seven people a year catch the plague across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials say the person in El Dorado County is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 KGO-TV.

			&lt;p&gt;Protein is having its moment: From grocery store shelves to Instagram feeds, high-protein foods are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food labels shout their protein content in bold, oversized fonts, while social media overflows with recipes promising to pack more protein into your favourite dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to the International Food Information Council's &lt;a href="https://ific.org/research/2024-food-health-survey/"&gt;Food and Health Survey&lt;/a&gt;, "high protein" topped the list of popular eating patterns in 2024. But does the hype match the science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-protein-and-fiber-diet-linked-to-longer-better-sleep-study-finds"&gt;High-Protein And Fiber Diet Linked to Longer, Better Sleep, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential to good health and boosting protein intake can &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nutrition-and-healthy-aging-the-role-of-protein-quality-in-combatting-muscle-loss-237112"&gt;support healthy aging and fitness goals&lt;/a&gt;, but the rush to pile on grams – often driven by marketing more than medical need – raises questions. How much do you really need? Can you overdo it? What's the best source of protein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article breaks down the facts, debunks common myths and answers the most pressing questions about protein today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is dietary protein and why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is one of the three essential macronutrients your body needs in large amounts, alongside carbohydrates and fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While carbs and fats are primarily used for energy, protein plays a more structural and functional role. It helps build and repair tissues, supports immune health and produces enzymes, hormones and other vital molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are made of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22243-amino-acids"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Your body can make some amino acids, but nine must come from food. These are called essential amino acids. That's why protein is a daily dietary requirement, not just a delicious post-workout bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike fat and carbohydrates, which the body can store for later use, protein doesn't have a dedicated storage system. That means you need to replenish it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In extreme situations – like prolonged fasting or severe illness – your body will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-017-0845-5"&gt;break down its own muscle&lt;/a&gt; to release amino acids for energy and repair. It's a last-resort mechanism that underscores just how essential protein is for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170332" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins.jpg" alt="Healthy Bowl of Salad with Plant-Based Protein" class="wp-image-170332 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170332" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plant-based options include legumes, soy products, whole grains, nuts, seeds and even some vegetables. (Aflo Images/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much protein do people need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of protein an individual needs to consume each day may vary based on age, physical activity levels and the presence of health conditions. However, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for daily protein intake is the same for almost everyone: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/77.1.109"&gt;0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/d)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a woman weighing 65 kilograms should aim to consume approximately 52 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat is that the RDA is set to prevent protein deficiency, not to promote optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy003"&gt;Older adults&lt;/a&gt; who have a reduced ability to utilize the nutrients they consume, &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt; whose bodies need more substrate for tissue growth and repair, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/an.115.011817"&gt;pregnant or breastfeeding individuals&lt;/a&gt; whose protein intake is shared with another being, often need more protein. Sometimes as much as 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, an older person of the same body mass (65 kilograms) might need between 78 g and 130 g of protein daily, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2013.05.021"&gt;far exceeding the RDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is there such a thing as too much protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several expert groups agree that consuming more protein can be beneficial in certain situations – &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2014.04.007"&gt;particularly for older adults&lt;/a&gt; – there is probably little to no advantage in consuming protein amounts exceeding two grams per kilogram per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that if you are generally healthy, increasing your protein intake will not shorten your lifespan, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy197"&gt;cause your kidneys to fail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2412"&gt;give you cancer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.145110"&gt;lead to bone loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should I consume my protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent social media influencer recently claimed that post-menopausal women must consume protein within a very short window (~45 minutes) after exercise, or any benefits from exercise will quickly dissipate and they will lose all their muscle. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-10-53"&gt;This is absolutely not the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of an "anabolic window" – a brief period after exercise when recovering muscles make the best use of protein – has long been debunked. Perhaps more accurately described as a &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/10.2519/jospt.2018.0615"&gt;garage door rather than an anabolic window&lt;/a&gt;, there is a generous period of at least 24 hours to consume protein after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means your muscles remain sensitive to the muscle-building effects of protein for a long time after exercise. So, focusing your efforts on consuming enough protein each day is much more important than stressing about guzzling your protein shake in the changing room immediately following your workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you're eating enough protein each day, feel free to consume it on a schedule that fits your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if increasing the amount of protein that you eat at each meal helps you feel fuller and curb your appetite, you may be a little less likely to overeat or indulge in sweet treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the increasing off-label use of Type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; medications such as GLP-1 agonists, which significantly reduce appetite, putting protein on your plate first might – and it's a considerable might – help slow muscle loss that accompanies this drastic weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is rather speculative, and resistance exercise will probably be your best option for slowing muscle loss while on these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are all proteins created equal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is found in a wide variety of foods, from animal sources such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy to plant-based options like legumes, soy products, whole grains, nuts, seeds and even some vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is also widely available as a nutritional supplement, with whey, casein and collagen being among some of the most popular options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal-based proteins are often touted by many online as superior, especially when it comes to supporting muscle growth, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.07.005"&gt;but the reality of protein quality is more nuanced.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal proteins often contain more of the essential amino acids and are more bioavailable, meaning they are easier for the body to absorb and use. However, a well-planned plant-based diet can also supply all the essential amino acids the body needs – it just takes a bit more variety and intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't enough, and you find yourself trying to wrap your head around food labelling, you're not the only one.

Most of these, like diets promoted by influencers, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/health-halo-food-marketing-labels.html"&gt;unnecessary "health halo" gimmicks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to follow a varied, whole-food, protein-forward diet – &lt;a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/"&gt;much like the dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. And whatever your preferred protein source – animal- or plant-based – fill about a quarter of your plate or bowl at breakfast, lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach will greatly support your overall health, especially when combined with a diverse diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, along with &lt;a href="https://csepguidelines.ca/"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that protein is an essential nutrient, and consuming enough of it daily is crucial for maintaining good health. But meeting your body's protein needs doesn't need to be complicated.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259984/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

There also was a case in Bonneville County earlier this month. “Without any link between these two confirmed cases in North Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Dr. Christine Hahn, the state epidemiologist, said in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/news/measles-circulating-among-idaho-communities-health-officials-urge-consultation-healthcare"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311584836.html"&gt;first found&lt;/a&gt; in the city of Coeur d’Alene’s wastewater in late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 6, public health officials &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311628436.html"&gt;in Eastern Idaho&lt;/a&gt; reported that a person traveling internationally had tested positive in Bonneville County. Then, on Aug. 12, the health district serving North Idaho &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311677969.html"&gt;confirmed a case&lt;/a&gt; in Kootenai County — the first known case of measles in the state’s panhandle since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three cases have been in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly,” Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932"&gt;have seen outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;highly contagious disease&lt;/a&gt; that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can survive in the air for two hours after an infected person has left the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 13% of adults and 21% of children with measles are hospitalized for the disease, according to Hahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Welfare and the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://panhandlehealthdistrict.org/news-release/08-12-2025-first-confirmed-measles-case-in-panhandle-since-1991/"&gt;Panhandle Health Distric&lt;/a&gt;t encouraged residents to verify their family’s vaccination records. Children are recommended to get two doses, once when they turn 1 and once before they start kindergarten, at about age 4 or 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosters aren’t needed, but if you can’t remember whether you were previously vaccinated, it causes no harm to get the two doses again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, two childhood doses of vaccine is all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime,” the news release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80% of kindergarteners in Idaho in the 2023-24 school year were vaccinated, leaving about 20% unprotected, according to the annual &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;National Immunization Survey&lt;/a&gt;.

Then came the pandemic. The once obscure molecule was celebrated as our salvation, as it served as the basis for vaccines to fight Covid-19. The once-unknown scientists who had advanced mRNA technology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/" rel&gt;won the Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2023 for saving millions of lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mRNA, vaccines were just supposed to be the beginning. The technology was supposed to be the holy grail, the thing that would turn our bodies into factories for making the medicines that could cure us of—well, anything, from rare diseases to cancer. “Out of the horror of Covid will come remarkable advances,” said Jeremy Farrar, the then-director of Wellcome, a charitable trust dedicated to healthcare, in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast-forward to today, with mRNA now facing an implacable foe: Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In 2021 RFK Jr. claimed that the Covid shot was “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” Two weeks ago he announced that the federal government was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/05/nation/rfk-vaccine-funding/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" rel&gt;canceling nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in government-funded mRNA research projects. Entrepreneurs who have founded companies to develop mRNA-based therapeutics say the government’s antipathy is causing investors to pull out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US" rel&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the 15-year-old biotech company that was founded to exploit mRNA—its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US/about-us/our-story" rel&gt;very name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a play on the molecule—has lost 95 percent of market value, and it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/07/31/business/moderna-layoffs-cost-cutting-vaccines/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" rel&gt;plans to lay off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 percent of its workforce. Even before Kennedy’s latest salvo, the government had canceled a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-vaccine-funding-cut-virus-h5n1-biosecurity-next-pandemic/" rel&gt;$766 million contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; between Moderna and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop several flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For mRNA &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" rel&gt;true believers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—and there are still plenty of them—these attacks on a molecule with such lifesaving potential is akin to Galileo’s trial in the seventeenth century for the heretical claim that the earth revolves around the sun, shutting down science and preventing progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that the truth, as is so often the case, is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Free Press</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 23:18:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQYnhHcTdJY3pVOHZ4SXZuanNmLW85bG1FdGhXOWhLdktTcXFEcUpDTXVxYzJWMkY4dlQwNTBZbnpTLUF0NldneXFyUVNIMVU4WHphRUpTWUQ2SlpFQ19zOGNueHZacWJxU0R0dFNINFc4UXZEa2hVTkx2TnZSMDlsTg</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，食用这些食物可以将胃肠道癌风险降低36 ％ - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5lNWNzSll1SFZkMDZwMEJVdnlyM2ZsWlF0VHNCeERhbDhBMGhtYnp2TjAtYlhnQnlWU05aWGg3cEVjYkk2aE1GSC1nTlAzc2V3VGpQS2lzYVBMZEdxNDFyOTRhUXlpNDM0VjRubkt1cEQtU1VHOEFEbmVMOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there is a lot of evidence regarding the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;role fruits and vegetables can play&lt;/a&gt; in reducing cancer risk, researchers from Korea wanted to see if certain colors of produce made a bigger difference than others. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break them down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers enrolled more than 11,000 participants who were attending health check-ups at the National Cancer Center (NCC) in Korea between October 2007 and December 2021. Participants were followed for an average of eight years, during which time 214 gastrointestinal cancers were diagnosed; researchers gathered diagnosis data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and NCC electronic medical records.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers collected data via two baseline questionnaires. One gathered demographic information, including age, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, household income, occupation, marital status, physical activity and family history of cancer. The other one was a food frequency questionnaire that asked about consumption of 106 culturally-relavant foods, including frequency and amounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8071224/how-to-choose-the-healthiest-canned-fruits-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;classified fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; according to their colors. But instead of going by the exterior color, they went by the color of the flesh. So where some might consider apples as falling into red fruits, pears into green or yellow and bananas as yellow, those examples were categorized as being white for this study, since their flesh is white. This is partly because people in Korea tend to remove the peel of fruits like apples and pears, so researchers felt this was more applicable to real life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, including adjusting for demographics, researchers found the following major findings:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also point out several limitations to this study. First, because it was specifically done with a Korean population, it is unknown if these results extend to other populations. Also, a follow-up of eight years is relatively short for cancer development, so a longer follow-up may offer more accurate results. Lastly, all gastrointestinal cancers were lumped together, so researchers can’t say if certain colors are more effective for certain types of gastrointestinal cancers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we can’t perfectly convert the 188 g/day of white fruits and veggies into cups, we can get close by offering examples. For instance, 188 grams would be about 1 ¾ cups chopped cauliflower, a large golden delicious apple or two small bananas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As for the red and purple fruits and veggies, 34 grams would be about two medium slices of tomato or a couple of large strawberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These amounts can all contribute to the USDAs recommendation of 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;There is good news from Virginia when it comes to the deadly infection sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is truly a groundbreaking discovery,” said Jianjie Ma, a professor in the department of surgery at the University of Virginia. “Sepsis is a very challenging disease to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma is part of the team at U.Va., along with the University of Michigan, that has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/08/15/new-monoclonal-antibody-targets-deadly-sepsis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;developed a monoclonal antibody to stop sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. The deadly infection impacts up to 50 million people worldwide every year, killing about 11 million people, according to researchers. It’s the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really urgent matter in the hospital, because when patients are admitted to the hospital, they have to be treated right away,” he said. “Any delay, one hour delay will cost 5% to 10% chance of people dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.Va. has received $800,000 from the research company Virginia Catalyst to launch a clinical trial of the antibody at U.Va. Health and Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our technology will, can stop the dying process by targeting the very innate immune defense of our body,” Ma said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the antibody has the potential to treat a range of inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are ready, and we have a lot of goals ahead of us,” Ma said. “It’s a really urgent matter in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said applications could include deadly acute respiratory distress syndrome, which came to public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is tissue damage caused when blood flow is cut off and restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have now made the antibody drug product available to start the clinical trial as soon as we can,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling out a yoga mat and flowing with your breath could be one of the best exercises for improving sleep in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meta-analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials has revealed that regular, high-intensity yoga is more strongly associated with improved sleep than walking, resistance training, combination exercise, aerobic exercise, or traditional Chinese exercises, like qi gong and tai chi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trials included in the analysis came from more than a dozen countries and involved over 2,500 participants with sleep disturbances across all age groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;b&gt;These 4 Simple Exercises Could Help Break Your Insomnia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When researchers at the Harbin Sport University in China crunched the numbers, they found that high-intensity yoga for less than 30 minutes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;twice a week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was the best exercise antidote for poor sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking was the next best form of physical activity, followed by resistance exercise. &lt;span&gt; Positive results were seen in as few as 8 to 10 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings are somewhat inconsistent with a 2023 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.43595"&gt;&lt;span&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that aerobic exercise or mid-intensity exercise three times a week is the most effective way to improve sleep quality in individuals with sleep disturbances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; One of the studies included in that trial, however, did find that yoga had more significant effects on sleep outcomes than other exercise types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, yoga can be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/well/move/does-yoga-qualify-as-an-aerobic-workout.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;difficult to categorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; as either aerobic or anaerobic, and its intensity can vary depending on the technique used. Perhaps these differences in practice can explain why the outcomes differ from trial to trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most recent meta-analysis cannot explain why yoga may be particularly beneficial for sleep, but several possibilities exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only can yoga raise the heart rate and push the muscles, it can also regulate breathing. Research &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-2788-6.ch005"&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that breath control can activate the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in 'rest and digestion'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/hm.hm_78_19"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; even suggest yoga regulates brainwave activity patterns, which could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.33745/ijzi.2023.v09ispl2.006"&gt;&lt;span&gt;promote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deeper sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;&lt;span&gt;robust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bad-night-of-sleep-this-20-minute-fix-can-do-wonders"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that exercise in general is beneficial for sleep, studies that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;compare specific exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and their long-term effects are lacking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caution should be exercised when interpreting findings from studies on sleep disturbances, given the limited number of studies included and the unique characteristics of the sleep disturbances population," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; researchers at Harbin Sport University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our bodies and brains are all different, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution to insomnia or other sleep disturbances.

And, at least for those of us whose brains have probably melted from spending too much time on an app where said arguments take place, it turns out it's pretty sound advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/well/mind/nature-brain-attention.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York Times &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, there's a growing body of evidence suggesting that simply spending time in nature can instantly boost your algorithm-addled brain's attention span. It's part of what's called "attention restoration theory," and while its premise may not be totally surprising, since going outside to "clear your head" or "get some fresh air" are clichés, the fascinating thing is that scientists can't agree on exactly why &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;it's happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The evidence is accumulating that, yes, something about walking in nature is benefiting our attention," Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Mark emphasized that it's a theory: "We don't know if that's the real explanation for what's going on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attention restoration theory was first developed in the 1980s by two married University of Michigan psychologists, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, and posits that our attention spans are a limited resource that needs to be recharged, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYT &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains. And for one reason or another, being in nature helps accomplish just that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19121124/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2008 experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with several dozen University of Michigan students, half were made to take a walk through an arboretum, a type of park or garden dedicated to trees. The other half took a walk through the local city streets. Later, the groups traded places. Attention and memory tests administered before and after their brief excursions showed that when students ambled among the trees, their scores surged by nearly 20 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You didn't even need to like or enjoy the nature walk to get these cognitive benefits," Marc Berman, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago who conducted the test, told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Walking on a cold winter day provided the same boost as a walk in the summer, the newspaper noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the Kaplans' central arguments was how nature is "softly fascinating," capturing our attention without overworking it. A city, by contrast, imposes on us its oppressive, busy geometry. Building on this, Berman tries to ground the theory in some tangible properties of nature, like soft, curved lines, and fractals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"That might give our brains a rest, and that's why we might see these benefits," he told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07850-5" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eye-tracking study&lt;/a&gt; backs up the idea. In an experiment, the researchers found that when participants were shown images of nature scenes, they exhibited significantly less eye movement than when viewing urban ones. But an analysis of the images couldn't determine what could be causing the difference in eye movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amy McDonnell, a researcher at the University of Utah, repeated a version of Berman's experiment, but used electroencephalogram, or EEG, to scan the participants' brain activity. Per the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, the brain scans showed that the nature group had less brain activity after their stroll, and bounced back with more activity when asked to do an attention task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McDonnell's work and the eye-tracking study are compelling empirical evidence that something real is taking place — but what that something is won't be easy to untangle. Some of the science can be a little "hand-wavy," McDonnell admits, which is a fair criticism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a tendency to treat nature as something romantic with almost magical properties. In reality, maybe it's a change in environment that's mostly responsible. Or maybe this is a byproduct of our urban-rural dichotomy, rather than something inherent to "nature" itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever's going on, we recommend mulling it over during a nice jaunt through the woods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on mental health: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/teen-hospitalized-ai-chatbot" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Teens Keep Being Hospitalized After Talking to AI Chatbots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:16:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBKQXNGZ0QwTkFPcWs1Q2ZYYzBIS2dVV3NCV2VNNUxoR2xDcXNSTDl2STI4cjdIS05FQUVCUWdJam90N1RkQkZqblNQRGRfZ2pfUFdvbzBnLU1EQQ</guid></item><item><title>新型疟疾病例促使新泽西州对蚊子进行检测-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOQVdKazhEdUs4S2dwMno2eGZlanJoTWJ1a0x2bHdXMHpLQmQ1dVpLSTl1ZDd3UUlMLVdNQ01icU92NXYycW51VWx1ZDNsR2dnVFBodnVuYTlyeWFZZ21McHB1Y2xzcENPS3VEZ29qTEhpazVGcFl5czgwak95V2trdHIzZC0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 20:53:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOQVdKazhEdUs4S2dwMno2eGZlanJoTWJ1a0x2bHdXMHpLQmQ1dVpLSTl1ZDd3UUlMLVdNQ01icU92NXYycW51VWx1ZDNsR2dnVFBodnVuYTlyeWFZZ21McHB1Y2xzcENPS3VEZ29qTEhpazVGcFl5czgwak95V2trdHIzZC0</guid></item><item><title>卫生部发布杜瓦尔县蚊媒疾病咨询- firstcoastnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9AFBVV95cUxOS05tblJ5aHYyOWxwS2dDZllzNkFBY1NuZ3J4OHVmREZnSm02U0tvMWpnTlpnc3FrM3c1QlZnbFBpX0VvbkRoT0ZTNFhjQTB3V04ydzhzUzYySWhteVpZeW5XdXZ1X0FVMC1sV3NuWmNVMU9ZM3BHWUlTemdIbkdGMkU5clBTMkF0M1N6Mll1elJWcUFmWGhFQk5kRWVqNmJGZzdqa1kySFpnU1EtTDhxck9nTWgxd3VYRVQ2M1pvbnlPOHJwOGJGRGRocm9KR3BXcmUzY25RbUN0anA2ejQxd3l3Um91TEZXQzJ3VTdvSG5GdFlC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;DOH-Duval aims to spread awareness of the virus to avoid risks of further infections.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Florida Department of Health in Duval County (DOH-Duval) is advising the community to be aware of an increase in mosquito-borne activity in parts of the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press release by the DOH states that several chickens have tested positive for the West Nile virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Center of Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; says the following about the West Nile virus:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;West Nile virus can result in mild illness with flu-like symptoms or severe illness that affects the central nervous system or results in hospitalization or death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC also states that there is no treatment for the virus; however, there are ways of relieving symptoms, such as rest, fluid and pain medication.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christopher Bazzoli with Cleveland Clinic explains the best way to relieve symptoms from any level of mosquito bite is resting and taking fluid and pain medication. He mentions these warning signs to tell the difference between a normal bite and one that could lead to West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's important to monitor yourself after any bug bite," Bazzoli said. "And things that we're looking out for as reasons that we should reach out to your primary care doctor or seek medical care are aches and pains. This can be belly pains, headaches, fevers and chills, feeling like you're coming down with a cold, or a systemic illness."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bazzoli adds to watch out for rashes, especially those that crop up in other areas of the body away from the bite site. If you have any of these symptoms, check in with your doctor as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DOH and the Jacksonville Mosquito Center, the two will continue to monitor mosquito-borne illnesses throughout the state. These illnesses include West Nile virus infections, Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria, chikungunya and dengue.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/mosquito-prev-poster-eng-8.5x11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;DOH recommends&lt;/a&gt; applying mosquito repellent while outdoors and emptying or covering anything that can hold water to avoid mosquito breeding.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Since mosquitoes can travel several miles, county health officials urge everyone in the region to take precautions and prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement says symptoms of the St. Louis encephalitis virus are similar to those of the West Nile virus, and most people who contract it will not have symptoms. Those who do have symptoms can experience fever, headache, vomiting and tiredness, and some can develop a neuroinvasive form of the virus that can lead to tremors, disorientation and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus can — in some rare cases — cause long-term disability or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Hill, epidemiology bureau manager with the county health department, encouraged providers to consider a St. Louis encephalitis virus diagnosis for patients with matching symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis encephalitis virus is not transmitted from person to person outside of blood transfusion, according to health officials; it is spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. There are currently no vaccines or medications for the virus, and the only way to prevent it is to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some suggestions from the county health department on how to avoid mosquito bites include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-registered repellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves and pants after dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drain any standing water in your yard, making sure to also clear debris from the roof gutters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut weeds and tall grass short, as "adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during the hot daylight hours."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department urges county residents to be cautious until the first frost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported that St. Louis encephalitis virus was detected in three mosquito pools —  0.36% of pools tested across the state — while West Nile virus was detected in 64 pools, or 7.55% of pools tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statewide report says there have been three human cases of West Nile virus reported in Utah this year: two in the Bear River health district and one in Salt Lake County. There have also been three cases of West Nile virus in horses, two in Utah County and one in the Bear River health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

This brain region, which gates sensory information, was found to be overactive during stimuli and social interactions, leading to seizures, repetitive behaviors, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By suppressing this activity with drugs, including one already under investigation for epilepsy, researchers were able to reverse these symptoms. The findings suggest a shared brain mechanism between autism and epilepsy and highlight a promising new target for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Hyperactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus linked to autism behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs that suppressed this activity reversed autism-like symptoms in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings explain overlap between autism and epilepsy, with potential for new therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Medicine scientists investigating the neurological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have found that hyperactivity in a specific brain region could drive behaviors commonly associated with the disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of the disease, the researchers identified the reticular thalamic nucleus — which serves as a gatekeeper of sensory information between the thalamus and cortex — as a potential target for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112357"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/autism-reversed-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were able to reverse symptoms similar to those of autism — including susceptibility to seizures, heightened sensitivity to stimulus, increased motor activity, repetitive behaviors and decreased social interactions — by giving the mice drugs that suppressed this area of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same drugs are being studied for the treatment of epilepsy, highlighting where the processes underlying autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may overlap in the brain and why they often occur in the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be published Aug. 20 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neural circuitry connecting the thalamus and cortex has been implicated in autism in both humans and animal models, but the role of the reticular thalamic nucleus was not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recorded the neural activity of this brain region in mice while observing the animals’ behavior. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population — 30% versus 1% — though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cdaaa2a1a9a0aca3af8dbeb9aca3aba2bfa9e3a8a9b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bruce Goldman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce Goldman – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adw4682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reticular Thalamic Hyperexcitability Drives Autism Spectrum Disorder Behaviors in the Cntnap2 Model of Autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Sung-Soo Jang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reticular Thalamic Hyperexcitability Drives Autism Spectrum Disorder Behaviors in the Cntnap2 Model of Autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and comorbidities such as sensory abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in these symptoms, its precise roles in ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examine the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key modulator of thalamocortical activity, to ASD-related behavioral deficits using a &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt; knockout mouse model. &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed increased seizure susceptibility, locomotor activity, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced intrathalamic oscillations and burst firing in RT neurons, accompanied by elevated T-type calcium currents. In vivo fiber photometry confirmed behavior-associated increases in RT population activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, pharmacological and chemogenetic suppression of RT excitability via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 activation of the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di significantly improved ASD-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings identify RT hyperexcitability as a mechanistic driver of ASD and highlight RT as a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:41:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBWY3ktQXlhLURQYnhoLTVZWlBrZFFLc1VwRWdPSF9MRUNRQ2lWNmhrT2F1ZzFoQ3VxSTJES3JodS1Lb1EwUnhVc3hHNkZ0X19PR2lkSzhhakduUGE1OE0xQlQzRTFjMnYtRklWZGs1ZXpVWmo0QmNidw</guid></item><item><title>癌症诱导的神经损伤促进对抗PD-1治疗的耐药性-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1sRlRnUTlHUC1yRk9UYjNUcVk0U19vc3VvRC1XaW83UEVkdjN1bm1SU1hON2czYnB5RjE2VGl4ZXN0OEZQbFJ5Vk84d05ULUhEQWtkNUtHNm5QVENIUlRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;Clinical samples and cohorts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the different clinical cohorts used in this Article, and presents the results of their relevant analysis.

All patients provided written informed consent. The authors had unrestricted access to the data and were responsible for all content. Patients older than 18 were eligible if they had resectable stage II–IV (M0) CSCC, for which primary surgery would be recommended in routine clinical practice. Patients with stage II CSCC should have a primary tumour ≥3 cm in longest diameter to be eligible.

After a screening period of up to 28 days, the patients received the neoadjuvant cemiplimab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Imaging assessments were performed at the baseline and at weeks 6 and 12. After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, the protocol window for surgery was study days 75–100. If the patient met the criteria for early discontinuation of cemiplimab during the neoadjuvant period, the treating physician could divert the patient to surgery earlier. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were subjected to histopathological assessment for confirmation of diagnosis and to permit morphologic comparison between tumour tissue before treatment and any residual tumour following therapy.

Staining was performed using antibodies against CD8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS-457s), PD-1 (Abcam, ab137132) and PD-L1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 13684S) using a BOND-RX instrument with a Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems, DS9800). Stained slides were scanned and digitalized using a Scan Scope XT system (Aperio/Leica Biosystems). Single-stain annotations were performed by a pathologist, and staining quantification was done using HALO software (v.2.3.2089.70; Indica Labs). The number of marker-positive cells was calculated and expressed as positive-cell density (number of positive cells per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-tests using Prism (v.9). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec11"&gt;High-plex, high-dimensional IF staining and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Lunaphore Comet to stain and image the FFPE tissue samples. In brief, FFPE slides were placed in tanks containing BioGenex EZ Elegans AR 2 buffer, enclosed inside a BioGenex EZ Retriever microwave system. The samples were heated in the microwave to 107 °C for 15 min to dewax, rehydrate and retrieve the antigens. After heating, the slides were cooled to room temperature, loaded into the Comet system, and covered and sealed by a fast-fluidic exchange microfluidics chip for staining and imaging in the instrument. The Comet system performs a sequential IF-based staining and imaging followed by an elution of the primary and secondary antibodies. Optimal staining conditions for each antibody panel were determined using the ‘Characterization Part 2’ instrument protocol, in which antibodies are titrated for optimal signal and the elution efficiency is verified by an iterative procedure comprised of staining, imaging, elution and re-imaging for elution confirmation for all antibodies. This study used four mIF panels, described in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; (neuroimmune panel 1; myelin degradation panel; neuroimmune panel 2; and neuroimmune panel 3) for patient-derived tissues. Two panels (m-neuroimmune panel; and m-myelin degradation panel) were used for mouse-derived tissues (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM11"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;).

A deep learning classifier was trained using specific tissue features from annotated reference images to guide the identification of ROIs. In brief, a tissue ROI was created after training two variables (tissue and non-tissue regions). Tissue and ROI boundaries were then delineated using image analysis smoothing. Aberrant signals, such as those caused by dust particles, tissue folds or air bubbles, were excluded manually from the ROIs. Another deep learner classifier was developed and trained for nerve identification following two training variables (nerve and non-nerve structure) within the delineated tissue ROI regions. Staining for the nerve markers NFH and B3T delineated the nerve within the tissue ROIs. The following training parameters were used to develop the nerve identification app: input: NFH and B3T; learning parameters: learning rate-1.0e-05; Mini-batch size-2; loss function: cross-entropy; iteration: 300,000. Cells in non-nerve areas (NFH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) were identified by watershed desegmentation of the nuclear DAPI signal and removal of incomplete nuclei by size exclusion. The resulting nuclear mask was enlarged by 1.25 μm (5 pixels) to capture nuclear and adjacent cytoplasmic fluorescence signals. A further estimation of the cytoplasm was generated using a dilation of the nuclear mask to a maximum of 3.75 μm (15 pixels). Cell types were identified using a hierarchical decision tree with empirically determined thresholds visually verified across the tissues. NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nerves were segmented using the NFH/B3T signal intensity. Nerve nuclei were excluded a priori from the initial cell classification strategy, and only those that exceeded the threshold for NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were incorporated into the nerve mask. Neural niches were determined to have a 150-μm ROI diameter around each nerve (NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B3T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). All object-based phenotyping resulting tables were exported as CSV files for downstream analyses. Staining was performed 4–8 min per cycle for primary antibodies, diluted 1:50–1:2000 in a Multistaining Buffer (Lunaphore). Secondary antibodies, AlexaFluor 555 and AlexaFluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted 1:200 and 1:400, respectively, in a multistaining buffer. Tissues were counterstained with DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at every cycle. Imaging was performed on the Comet at 80 ms for DAPI, 400 ms for AlexaFluor 555, and 200 ms for AlexaFluor 647 at each cycle. Elution was performed for 4 min using an elution buffer (Lunaphore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec12"&gt;GeoMx DSP experimental design&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;cSCC anti-PD-1 clinical trial FFPE tumour samples were used for DSP of the neural and immune protein expression (see below the description of assays and markers used). First, we mapped the neural niches using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E)-stained tissue sections, including the tumour and surrounding tissue. These slides were scanned using a Scan Scope digital pathology system (Aperio) in SVS format at a 40× magnification and visualized using Image Scope software (Aperio). All nerve profiles in the specimen were annotated, including PNI. The extent of viable tumour or tumour bed and uninvolved tissue was drawn or designated on whole-slide scans. The respective tumour and surrounding tissue were obtained using the annotations in Aperio files. The nerve density was calculated as the ratio between total number of nerves and the tumour or normal area (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the nerve invasion index was calculated as the number of invaded nerves divided by the tumour area (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, two consecutive 5-μm-thick tissue sections from samples obtained before and after anti-PD-1 therapy were stained according to the semiautomated GeoMx DSP standard protein protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="NanoString.

Both sections were stained for the following morphology biomarkers: panCK, SYTO 13 (GeoMx Solid Tumour TME Morphology Kit, NanoString, 121300301), β-III-tubulin (EP1569Y, AF, Abcam, ab52623; 1:2,000 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and neurofilament (EPR20020, AF, Abcam, ab207176; 1:1,000 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig11"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). Optimization of IF biomarkers was previously performed with different antibody dilutions using normal colon tissue to achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio. One tumour section was used to profile TANs with the DSP neural cell profiling core (GMX-PROCO-NCT-HNCP-12) and GeoMx Parkinson’s pathology panel (GMX-PROMOD-NCT-HPDP-12). A serial tissue section was used to profile the perineural microenvironment with the following DSP human immuno-oncology protein core panel and modules: GeoMx Immune Cell Profiling (121300101), GeoMx IO Drug Target Assay (121300102), GeoMx Immune Activation Status Assay (121300103) and GeoMx Immune Cell Typing Assay (121300104; 49 protein targets).

ROIs were selected after pathological evaluation of sequential sections of H&amp;amp;E-stained nerve fibres in tumour tissue and tumour bed tissue identified by an expert pathologist (P.N.). Using a two-step strategy, a polygon and rectangle selection tool was applied to select ROIs of up to 660 × 785 mm. (1) Nerve profiling: a slide labelled with a DSP neuroprotein panel was used to select up to 12 intratumoural ROIs containing tumour-associated nerve fibres. Neural niches were identified and segmented using the β-III-tubulin (+), Neurofilament Heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype. (2) Perineural niche immune profiling: a consecutive section labelled with a DSP human immuno-oncology protein panel was used to select up to 12 matching ROIs with TANs. The matching perineural microenvironment compartment, that is, neural niches, were identified using the same morphology markers (β-III-tubulin (+), neurofilament heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype). Segmented areas (also known as areas of illumination) were illuminated individually using ultraviolet light with the GeoMx DSP device. Oligonucleotide tags conjugated with antibodies present within each area of illumination were photocleaved. Released tags were quantified using nCounter, and tag counts of the various markers were mapped back to their corresponding tissue locations, yielding a spatially resolved digital profile of analyte abundance. Digital counts were normalized using background correction.

The initial dataset consisted of DEGs from tumours lacking PNI compared with those exhibiting incidental PNI, identified solely through histopathological evaluation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2,412). The second dataset included DEGs from tumours with no PNI versus those with clinical PNI, detected using imaging techniques (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7,793). To curate a gene list that captures the molecular features associated with any form of PNI (both incidental and clinical), we focused on DEGs that were upregulated in both datasets. Further refinement involved excluding genes exhibiting a fold change &amp;lt; 2 and a FDR &amp;gt; 0.001 across both comparisons (no PNI versus incidental PNI and no PNI versus clinical PNI). In our analysis, DEGs represented by multiple microarray probes were excluded if one or more probes failed to satisfy our inclusion criteria. Specifically, cases in which one probe suggested significant upregulation of a gene in PNI-positive cases, while another indicated either downregulation in PNI or no significant difference, were not considered. Ultimately, the final gene set consisted of 46 genes enriched in PNI-positive cases of cSCC of the head and neck (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM2"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 46-gene PNI/nerve injury signature was first tested on our anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant cSCC clinical trial bulk RNA-seq data using GSEA.

Hwang (see above for a description of the clinical cohort). FFPE tissue sections (5 µm) were prepared and mounted onto Superfrost Plus Micro Slides (VWR) under RNase-free conditions. The samples underwent deparaffinization, proteinase K digestion and heat-induced epitope retrieval using the Leica Bond RX system. After preparation, Nanostring CosMx spatial transcriptomics imaging was performed on the sections. TANs were categorized into three groups based on &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt; expression (healthy: no &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt; expression; intermediated: &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt; expression; injured: &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt; concomitant expression). Perineural niches were defined as regions within 150 μm of TANs in the TME. RNA in situ hybridization probes targeting a 960-plex base panel, along with 30 additional custom-selected probes, were hybridized overnight at 37 °C. After hybridization, the samples were washed and blocked and protein staining was performed using a fluorophore-conjugated antibody cocktail targeting CD298, B2M, PanCK, CD45 and CD3 proteins, along with DAPI for nuclear staining.

RealDRG cryopreserved hPS-cell-derived sensory neurons (nociceptors). Using the Senso-DM directed differentiation process on internal hiPS cell lines, we can generate billions of neurons at scale and at 99% purity—without the need for mitotic inhibitors. Principal component analysis shows that RealDRG neurons mature in the shortest time and are closer to primary human DRG tissue compared with other hiPS-cell-derived sensory neurons (&lt;a href="https://www.anatomic.com/realdrg"&gt;https://www.anatomic.com/realdrg&lt;/a&gt;). Donors provided written informed consent to donate tissue samples for the study, for which the protocol was reviewed and approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. In brief, each donor was undergoing surgical treatment that necessitated ligation of spinal nerve roots to facilitate tumour resection or spinal reconstruction. Spinal roots were ligated proximal to the DRG, spinal roots were sharply cut both proximal and distal to the DRG and excised DRGs were transferred immediately into a cold (&lt;span class="stix"&gt;∼&lt;/span&gt;4 °C) and sterile balanced salt solution containing nutrients. DRGs were transported to the laboratory on ice in a sterile, sealed 50 ml centrifuge tube. After arrival at the laboratory, each ganglion was carefully dissected from the surrounding connective tissues and sectioned into several 1–2 mm pieces, digested in 2 ml of a mixed enzyme solution (0.1% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T9201), 0.1% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C1764; w/v, final concentration) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025) diluted in DMEM/F-12), and transferred to a 37 °C rotator to shake at a speed of 124–128 rpm. Every 20 min, tissue fragments were allowed to settle, and the supernatant/dissociated cells were collected and transferred to DMEM/F-12 with an enzyme inhibitor. The supernatant was replaced with 2 ml of fresh digestion solution. The tissue was returned to the 37 °C rotator, and this process was repeated until tissue fragments were completely digested. Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 180 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and the cells were gently resuspended in culture medium with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with EV-free 10% serum and 2 mM glutamine. Cells were plated onto laminin-coated µ-Slide 8 Well (Ibidi) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 24–72 h. hIPS-cell-derived motor (RealMOTO) and sensory neurons (RealDRG) were purchased from Anatomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Mouse neurons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary sensory neurons were isolated from the TG dissected from 6–8-week-old mice as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Malin, S.

Mouse neurons were co-cultured with the mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma MOC1 cell line (Sigma-Aldrich, scc469) and B6-10K (obtained from the laboratory of K.Y.T.). Sensory or motor neurons were cultured to assess the impact of nerves’ degenerative/regenerative status on immunotherapy in vitro. Neurons were plated on laminin-coated (Life Technologies, 23017015) round glass coverslips set in 12-well plates. Then, 2 h after plating, the wells were flooded with 1 ml of warm (37 °C) Ham’s F12 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 95% air. The carcinoma cells were plated (1:10 neuron: cancer cells ratio), and cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum in 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubation conditions, for 72 h, with or without anti-PD-1 antibody (cemiplimab, 1,000 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, or RMP1-14, 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, InVivoMAb Antibodies, BioXCell, for human and mouse, respectively), before neuron sorting and RNA extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Neuron viability assay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TG neurons were obtained from C57BL/6J mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), processed using the above protocol, seeded to 12-well culture plates (3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; total cells per well) and cultured for 72 h. The cultured neurons were then divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) in which each group was exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 72 h. The first group (control) received no medium change; the second group received fresh medium (20% FBS in Ham’s 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin); the third group received conditioned medium from the MOC1 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line previously cultured (10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; seeded cells in 20% FBS in Ham’s 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin) for 3 days. The fourth group of neurons was co-cultured with the MOC1 (10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cells. After 72 h of exposure, neurons were collected by trypsinization, medium was added (F-15 + 30% FBS) and then live neuro cells were stained with NeuO (membrane-permeable fluorescent dye) dye for 1 h and washed. NeuO-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using the CytoFLEX SRT Cell Sorter. RealDRG cryopreserved hPS-cell-derived sensory neurons were obtained from Anatomic. RealDRG neurons were seeded on 0.01% poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine-coated (Millipore Sigma, A-004-C) µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates (80827) at a density of 0.15 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; total cells per well. The poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine coating was performed overnight at room temperature in the tissue culture hood, followed by three washes with sterile water. Subsequently, iMatrix-511 silk (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in Dulbecco’s PBS (dPBS) was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after washing off the poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine. The RealDRG cells were cultured for 10 days to allow for maturation, with half of the Senso MM medium (Anatomic) being replaced every alternate day. After the initial 10-day culture period, the neurons were divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) and exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 4 days (96 h), aligning with the timeline in the provided PDF. The experimental groups were as follows: fresh medium: cells received fresh Senso MM medium (Anatomic). No medium change: cells were cultured for the entire 14-day period without any medium change. Conditioned medium: cells received conditioned media from B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells. To obtain conditioned medium, B16-F10 and Mia PaCa2 cells were seeded at 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cells in Senso MM medium and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced, and the supernatant was collected after another 24 h, filtered with a 0.22 µm filter and stored at 4 °C. This process was repeated, and the two collections were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Co-culture: cells were co-cultured with 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; seeded B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining and imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 4-day exposure period, the mature neurons from µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates were fixed with 4% buffered formalin. Neurons were then stained with NFH antibody (ab4680, Abcam) followed by a secondary Texas Red-conjugated antibody. Images were acquired using the Cytation 7 imaging reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell counts and neurite morphology were assessed using the neurite outgrowth module of the Gen5 Cytation 7 software. The experiment included four conditions (fresh medium, no medium change, conditioned medium and co-culture), with two wells per condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Neurite quantification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rDRGs were plated in duplicate wells in an 8-well Ibidi plate and assigned to one of four conditions: (1) fresh medium; (2) no medium change; (3) conditioned medium; or (4) direct co-culture with either B16-F10 or Mia PaCa-2 cells. Cell viability was confirmed using NeuO staining in the GFP channel before fixation. Cells were then fixed and stained with neurofilament heavy chain (NFH, Texas Red channel) to assess neuronal morphology and with DAPI to label nuclei. Using a ×20 magnification, multichannel fluorescence images were taken as a 12 × 12 image montage from the centre of each well in an 8-well Ibidi plate. The Agilent BioTek Cytation 5 cell imaging multimode reader was used for all image acquisition. A minimum of ten ROIs per condition was selected based on consistent cell density. ROIs were excluded if they exhibited low cell density or imaging artifacts. Morphological analysis and thresholding for the selection of neurons and assessment of neuronal morphology were completed using the neurite outgrowth module in Gen5 Cytation 7 software. We assessed neurite length and thickness across the four conditions, with two wells per condition. The Gen5 neurite outgrowth module analysis automatically provides results for both image-level metrics, such as total outgrowth length per image and cell-level average values, like the per-cell average neurite length. Default thresholding for soma selection was applied to exclude weak NFH signal in the TexasRed channel, and neurons were selected and distinguished from cancer cells by using the ‘optimize soma using nuclear signal’ setting for DAPI staining and by selecting for cells with NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; protrusions extending more than 20 µm from the cell, which represent neurites (dendrites and axons). ‘Only keep neurites connected to a soma’, ‘Discard short neurites’ and ‘Discard short ending branches’ were selected in the ‘Neurite’ settings window, with short neurites under 20 µm excluded and short ending branches under 5 µm excluded to ensure that only the true intact neurite signal was studied. From these 8–10 final ROIs, we exported morphology data from the manually programmed neurite outgrowth module. The metrics reported from each ROI were the average neurite length (µm) and the average neurite thickness (calculated as NFH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; area divided by neurite length in µm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;MEA for cell lines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-well CytoView MEA plate (Axion, M384-tMEA-24W) electrodes were prepared for culturing realDRG according to the Anatomic protocol (&lt;a href="https://www.anatomic.com/_files/ugd/a239f4_97800271c1964458aa21c9a9008849a3.pdf"&gt;https://www.anatomic.com/_files/ugd/a239f4_97800271c1964458aa21c9a9008849a3.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, around 7 ml cell-culture-grade water with penicillin–streptomycin was added to the outer rim of the plate. Then, electrodes were coated with 50 μl per well of 0.01% PLO for 1 h at room temperature. PLO was washed off four times with 500 μl cell-culture-grade water, ensuring complete removal between washes. Then, 50 μl of iMatrix-511 SILK (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in dPBS per well was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The human realDRG cells were quickly thawed in a water bath, collected in fresh F12 medium (20% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin), centrifuged at 300 rpm for 4 min and resuspended in Senso MM media (Anatomic). The realDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well. Basal spontaneous firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons assessed by MEA. After 10 days in normal culture, mature, firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in MOC1 conditioned medium or in MOC1-co-culture. Spontaneous firing rates were recorded at the baseline, 24 and 72 h. The mean firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons co-cultured with MIA PaCa-2 cells (20,000 or 50,000 cells per well) over 5 days was measured by MEA. RealDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well on 24-well CytoView MEA plates, with medium changes every 48 h. After 8–9 days in culture, mature neurons started firing spontaneously and, at day 10, all neurons established stable spontaneous activity. After 10 days in normal culture, mature firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in Mia-PaCa2-conditioned medium or in Mia-PaCa2 co-culture. The spontaneous functional activity of the realDRGs was recorded for a minimum of 10 min and every 24 h for 6 days (days 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Error bars in the figures represent the s.e.m. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple -comparisons test was used to determine statistical significance between groups, with a significance level of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Neuron mRNA library preparation and sequencing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was isolated from cultured neurons using total RNA was extracted using the RecoverALL Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced at the University of Houston Sequencing and Editing Core according to standard protocols. Enrichment for mRNA from total RNA was performed by coding-region-specific biotinylated capture probes, which were selected using streptavidin magnetic beads. mRNA-enriched libraries were prepared using the QIAseq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Qiagen) with 200 ng of input RNA. RNA was fragmented, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, ligated with sequence adaptors and amplified by PCR. Size selection for libraries was performed using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). The library purity was analysed using the DNA HS1000 tape with a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and the Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina), using an S4 flow cell at paired-end 150 bp configuration at 20–30 million read depth for each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Neuron transcriptome analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) were imported into Qiagen CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4. Initial quality control of the sequencing reads was performed using the built-in tools, including the Quality Control function, to evaluate read quality metrics, such as read length distribution, quality scores and potential adapter contamination. Low-quality reads and contaminants were trimmed or filtered out. The cleaned sequencing reads were mapped to the GRCh38.p14 reference genome using the Map Reads to Reference tool in the CLC Genomics Workbench. Gene expression levels were quantified using the Count Features tool. This step involved counting the number of reads mapped to each gene based on the annotation file corresponding to the reference genome. The output generated a count table indicating the raw read counts for each gene across all samples. Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; method implemented in the R Bioconductor package edgeR (v.4.2.1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="Chen, Y., Chen, L., Lun, A.

Skin tumours (minimum 5 mm in diameter and persistent for at least 2 weeks) started to develop 9 months after the end of the UV-exposure protocol. Each tumour was split in half. One section was processed for FFPE, H&amp;amp;E stained and IF staining with anti-pan-keratin (type I) was performed for confirmation of cSCC diagnosis. The remaining tissue section was macrodissected and incubated in cell culture medium for 7–10 days. The cultured cells were sorted using the CD326 (EPCAM) antibody, and the resulting isolated epithelial cells were again incubated in cell culture medium, IF stained with anti-pan-keratin (type I) (E6S1S) antibody and DAPI to confirm their epithelial origin. The isolated malignant keratinocytes were injected intradermally (200,000 cells per 60 μl) into C57BL/6 WT mice, and their tumorigenicity was recorded. The newly developed tumours were assessed using H&amp;amp;E staining to confirm the histopathological diagnosis of cSCC. This process resulted in five distinct UVSCC cell lines (M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6) (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig8"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;In vivo nerve injury modulation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used denervation and surgical axotomy to assess in vivo nerve injury modulation of the immune response.

All procedures were approved by the New York University Institutional Animal Care. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled, pathogen-free room under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle (06:00–18:00) with ad libitum access to food and water. The MOC2 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Sigma Chemicals) were cultured in IMDM/F12 (2:1 mixture) with 5% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% amphotericin, 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; EGF (Millipore), 400 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; hydrocortisone and 5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; insulin. Under 3% isoflurane anaesthesia, 20 μl of MOC2 cells (5,000 cells total) in serum-free culture medium was injected into the left whisker pad using a 10 μl Hamilton syringe. The mice were randomly allocated to four groups. The experimental groups were defined by the interval between cancer cell injection and the subsequent euthanasia of the animals, resulting in tumour development periods of 7, 9, 11 and 13 days. The tumours were processed for histological assessment and mIF staining, focusing on identifying PNI by tumour cells and characterizing the perineural immune infiltrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;MEA analysis of mouse tissue&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tumours were quickly dissected from euthanized animals (orthotopic B610K intradermal model in SKH1-Elite animals and normal skin controls) and analysed by P.D.V.’s laboratory, as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 77" title="Restaino, A.

One tumour slice/sample was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and processed for histological staining (H&amp;amp;E) to assess tumour presence. Electrical recordings were captured using a MEA1060-Inv-BC microelectrode array system (Multichannel Systems) with a perforated microelectrode array, 60pMEA100/30iR-Ti MEAs (890335, Harvard Apparatus). The MEAs used contained 60 electrodes, of which one is a reference electrode. These electrodes are spaced 100 µm apart in a 6 × 10 grid (ten electrodes per row arranged in six columns generating a rectangle of electrodes onto which tissue slice is placed); each electrode is 30 µm in diameter. The titanium nitride electrodes are contained within a glass ring, enabling us to maintain tissue slices under oxygenated (95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26.2 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 11 mM glucose, 1.3 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.5 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); this buffer preserves neuronal functions. The perforated MEAs allow for a gentle suction (applied by a vacuum pump) to keep the tissue slice in contact with electrodes for the duration of recordings. This enables us to capture the electrical activity from every electrode for every second of each recording. As such, recordings from 59 electrodes per second per slice were collected (one electrode is a reference electrode). Recordings occurred at room temperature using a 25-kHz sampling frequency and a Butterworth second-order digital filter set to high-pass with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz (to eliminate slow FPs). A STG4000 stimulus generator (Multichannel Systems) was used for stimulation, which consisted of biphasic voltage, −0.5 V and +0.5 V each for 100 µs and repeated after a 23 ms interval. Stimulation was applied to selected electrodes; evoked spike responses were recorded. Two independent types of stimulations were used on each slice. The first consisted of 14 electrodes while the second consisted of 20 electrodes. The same electrode sets were stimulated for all slices analysed and the stimulation parameters were identical. Recordings continued after electrical stimulations were turned off to allow for capturing of activity back to baseline. In all cases, continuous electrical activity per second per electrode recordings were captured and analysed using the MC_Rach4.6.2 software (Multichannel Systems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;TEM analysis of mouse samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEM analysis was conducted on mouse tissue samples from a previously established model of PNI in the sciatic nerve&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 78" title="Salvo, E. et al.

In brief, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Sciatic nerves were dissected and fixed for 2 h. Fixation was performed using a modified reduced osmium impregnation method. The samples were embedded in fresh 100% durcupan. The processed samples were sectioned (1 µm) and stained with 1% toluidine blue to identify the areas of interest. Thinner sections (70 nm) were mounted onto slot grids and loaded onto the Zeiss grid holder for EM imaging. Images were taken with a beam acceleration of 20.0 kV and a working distance of approximately 2.0 mm, capturing 6,144 px by 4,608 px images with a pixel size of 100 nm to 200 nm. A Talos120C transmission electron microscope with the Gatan (4k × 4k) OneView Camera was used for high-resolution EM imaging.

Then, 2 weeks later, the mice were euthanized, and lung metastases were visually confirmed in the B16F10-eGFP-inoculated group. Jugular nodose ganglia (JNC) were dissected into ice-cold HEPES-buffered DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12430062). For each biological replicate, JNC from four mice (two male, two female) were pooled and transferred into HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 2.4 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dispase II (Sigma-Aldrich, 04942078001), then incubated at 37 °C for 70 min. After washing with DMEM, ganglia were gently triturated using glass Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. Cells were centrifuged at 200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; over a 15% BSA gradient in PBS to remove debris, stained with SYTO 40 (10 μM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris, washed with PBS and resuspended in sterile flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA).

Library preparation was conducted at the Institut de Recherche en Cancérologie et en Immunologie (IRIC), Université de Montréal. The RNA quality was confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with all samples achieving an RNA integrity number of ≥7.5. Libraries were prepared using a poly(A)-enrichment, single-stranded RNA-seq method (KapaBiosystems, KAPA RNA Hyperprep Kit, KR1352) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with 75-cycle single-end reads. Basecalling was performed using Illumina RTA v.2.4.11, and demultiplexing was done using bcl2fastq v.2.20 (allowing for one mismatch in the index). Trimmomatic was used to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the 3′ end of each read, and the resulting high-quality reads were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse genome using STAR v.2.5.11, which also generated gene-level read counts. Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR. The generalized linear model likelihood ratio test from edgeR was used to identify significant DEGs between groups. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they had an FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold changes and −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated from the normalized data, and additional data analysis and visualization were carried out in RStudio.

Then, 7 days later, tumour-infiltrating neurons (or neurons in MPEK-injected skin) were retrogradely labelled by an acute intratumour injection of AAV9-CAG-mCherry-WPRE-SV40p (10 µl, 5.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;). Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were euthanized, and the L3–L5 DRG was collected and digested. Most CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were depleted using the MagniSort mouse CD45 depletion kit (Invitrogen, 8804-6864). The remaining neurons were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, nuclei were stained with SYTO 40 (10 µM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris. Cells were then purified by FACS on the BD FACSAria IIu cell sorter and subjected to single-cell barcoding using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library and Gene Expression v3.1 system (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X platform, generating 120 million total reads. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics) and analysed with Seurat. Low-RNA-content and dead cells were excluded (nFeature_RNA &amp;gt; 100, percent.mt &amp;lt; 5%). AAV9 expression was not detected and therefore subsequent analysis was performed using principal component analysis, which identified 19 clusters, which were assigned cell types using known markers and the Tabula Muris reference atlas. Clusters were grouped into major cell types, and cells that were not classified as neurons were excluded from the analysis. Four biological replicates per group were analysed to compare B16F10-injected mice and keratinocyte-injected mice.

Then, 10 days after tumour inoculation, the tumours were excised, minced with a razor blade and digested for 30 min in DMEM containing 10 mM HEPES, 1.6 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, 4942078001). The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm mesh, and samples from two mice were pooled for each experiment. After red blood cell lysis (Gibco, A10492-01), cells were stained with Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend, 423105) and a FITC anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BioLegend, 103107). Approximately 500,000 live immune cells, which included around 80% CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, were sorted on the BD FACSAria III cell sorter into a collection buffer (PBS, 0.04% BSA and 50% FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, F4135), then fixed and prepared for single-cell library construction using the Chromium 10x Fixed RNA kits (PN-1000414 and PN-1000497). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X system and reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). Count matrices were generated and analysed in Seurat. Next, low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were removed. Batch effect was corrected using canonical correlation analysis in Seurat. The threshold for dead cells was percent.mt &amp;lt; 10. The threshold to remove low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were nFeature_RNA &amp;gt; 200 and nFeature_RNA &amp;lt; 2500. Identification of the major immune phenotypes was performed based on the expression of key phenotypical markers (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#Fig14"&gt;9i&lt;/a&gt;).

Tumours were harvested and enzymatically digested in DMEM + 5% FBS (Seradigm, 3100) + 2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase D (Sigma, 11088866001) + 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Collagenase IV (Sigma, C5138-1G) + 40 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNAse I (Sigma, 10104159001) under constant shaking (40 min, 37 °C). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 70% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare), overlaid with 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at room temperature with acceleration and deceleration at 1. The cells were aspirated from the Percoll interface and passed through a 70-μm cell strainer. Single-cell suspensions were prepared in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with either Zombie Aqua (BioLegend, 423102) for 15 min at room temperature or Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Fc Block (0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; BD Biosciences, 553141) for 20 min at 4 °C, then stained for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-CD45-FITC (1:100; BioLegend, 103107) and anti-CD8-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (1:100; BioLegend, 100733). For cytokine expression analysis, cells were stimulated in vitro for 3 h with PMA (50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sigma-Aldrich, P1585), ionomycin (1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sigma-Aldrich, I3909) and GolgiStop (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554724). They were then fixed and permeabilized (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554714), stained with anti-IFN-γ-APC (1:100; BioLegend, 505810) and analysed on a Cytoflex (Beckman) flow cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;Immunofluorescence analysis of &lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt; expression in melanoma-innervating neurons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; B16F10-OVA-mCherry melanoma cells were injected intradermally into the right hindpaw of C57BL/6 mice or &lt;i&gt;Atf3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were anaesthetized with urethane (Sigma-Aldrich, U2500, 20%, 250 μl, i.p.) and perfused with 10 ml of PBS followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, 158127). The ipsilateral (tumour-bearing paw) and contralateral (control paw) L3–L5 DRGs were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C and then immersed sequentially in 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S8501) for 24 h each. The tissues were embedded in Fisher Healthcare Tissue-Plus O.C.T. Compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23-730-571), frozen at –80 °C and cryosectioned into 15–30 μm sections. The sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% BSA and 5% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, G9023) for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated at 4 °C for 48 h with rabbit anti-mouse ATF3 (1:100, Abcam, ab207434) and chicken anti-mouse TUBB3 (1:500, Abcam, ab41489) in staining solution (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum). After three 15-minute washes in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with AF488 anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ab150169) and AF647 anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Invitrogen, A-21245) antibodies. The samples were then washed and stained with DAPI (2 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Invitrogen, D1306) for 10 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Nikon Ti2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Prime 95B camera. Using ImageJ or Nikon Elements software, circular ROIs were drawn around each neuron and nucleus. The mean grey values for ATF3 and TUBB3 fluorescence (in a.u.) within each ROI were exported for further analysis in Microsoft Excel. The ratio of ATF3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to TUBB3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons was determined, indicating increased ATF3 expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs compared with the contralateral side. In parallel, a threshold-based method was also applied to define the relative number of ATF3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei, which also show increased relative expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs neurons. Values from &lt;i&gt;Atf3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;GFP/GFP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice independently validated these findings and are not shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were conducted to analyse immunohistochemical, in vitro and mouse data. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate nominal statistical significance. Owing to the variance of xenograft growth in control mice, we used at least three mice per genotype to give 80% power to detect an effect size of 20% with a significance level of 0.05. The number of independent mice used is listed in the figure legend for all mouse experiments. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. To assess differences in cytokine levels between groups, we used a nested one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to account for both technical and biological replicates, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. The cytokine levels were standardized by calculating &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scores based on the mean for plotting purposes. To compare tumour growth in mouse models under different interventions, tumour volume was recorded at multiple timepoints. In this way, we used a mixed-effects model (REML) to compare tumour growth curves and account for repeated tumour measures. Intervention groups, time and their interaction were considered to be fixed effects, and individual animals were considered to be random factors. Differences among growth curves were considered to be significant if the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value from the fixed-effects test for the interaction between the intervention group and time was lower than 0.05. Moreover, post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison test was conducted for pairwise comparisons between groups at specific timepoints. Analyses were performed using JMP Pro v.17.0 software and R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec51"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09370-8#MOESM1"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1sRlRnUTlHUC1yRk9UYjNUcVk0U19vc3VvRC1XaW83UEVkdjN1bm1SU1hON2czYnB5RjE2VGl4ZXN0OEZQbFJ5Vk84d05ULUhEQWtkNUtHNm5QVENIUlRn</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员首次在盐湖县蚊子中检测到罕见病毒- KUTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOZTFSNVNQUXkxRkhUWlNTNmktR3diMzJISFpPSXZzeHFHQlNYckNMQ0djdWRmd0ZESU1PemJYTkFUUTJDbjJWSjNyOFI5MExOWjlCTTBqUVZSOU0xX3I0bnB6Vzd5cHJnU1hZSURGajk1bU42VmxnMnl5V09VRmFDeG1rWVNYTl8zWEFodjA2elJMT1pUd05SQg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — &lt;/span&gt;Salt Lake County health officials detected a rare virus within the county mosquitos for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) has symptoms and transmits similarly to West Nile virus, according to the Salt Lake County Health Department officials, but is less common in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, very few people who have been infected have died from the virus. Since record-keeping of the mosquito-borne virus began in 2003, the CDC recorded a total of 307 cases.  Only 20 patients developed a fatal neuroinvasive disease from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who contract SLEV may not even show symptoms, according to the Salt Lake County Health Department. Those who do may experience fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Extreme symptoms include high fever, neck stiffness, tremors, disorientation, paralysis. In rare cases, the virus can lead to long-term disability or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we've confirmed St. Louis encephalitis virus is in our local mosquito population, Salt Lake County health care providers should consider it in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with compatible symptoms," said Mary Hill, Salt Lake County Health Department epidemiology bureau manager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is the first time SLEV has been found in Salt Lake County mosquitos, the virus was detected in the Beehive State before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022 and 2023, the virus was found in southwestern Utah mosquitos. Health officials found the virus in mosquitos in Millard County in 2024, and, in 2005, the virus was detected in birds in Utah County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Salt Lake County resident was infected with SLEV in 2016, but health officials said the source of the infection was never determined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no reported fatalities related to SLEV in Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials said there are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat St. Louis encephalitis. Utahns can reduce the risk of being infected by preventing mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KUTV</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:37:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOZTFSNVNQUXkxRkhUWlNTNmktR3diMzJISFpPSXZzeHFHQlNYckNMQ0djdWRmd0ZESU1PemJYTkFUUTJDbjJWSjNyOFI5MExOWjlCTTBqUVZSOU0xX3I0bnB6Vzd5cHJnU1hZSURGajk1bU42VmxnMnl5V09VRmFDeG1rWVNYTl8zWEFodjA2elJMT1pUd05SQg</guid></item><item><title>随着致命真菌在美国传播的速度比以往任何时候都快，专家警告新的“流行病” -每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOaVppQ2dvaXlLbWFCbDJaZENLYzBtTXA1MlJrdmo1azBCTWhMeHhOdmpxMXZ3ZFJ3ck9qbUtxN09uYzBPbXJRNnVCdDFZU3pwNzByUWx4ZWdBNXo5RU9FVXNreGtoNlN0czZRZ0pOeFFsUVJUMnpndnpKb21VQVozaGx0Z3o0YXZtOVFzNnk2cHlFQVJXV1FieUlTSGxHWG9WblVMYUlpVWd1RXVI0gGyAUFVX3lxTE8yZTNGQnJBQnB4eWJXWlJqSEVHWEVBUjdUSGdnSUNJY3JOc05wenBYdng0cVMxcEhXLUdTbU1aNWhHanY0Y2hkYnh5RmVfX1l6REpOWklCV2RNNmdacGVtMElZSmFwWEg0Sm96NUN4MEtGRlMxajQwR1hod1JEcDJoaTFpZlBBNkRKUHVuUFBsbTgwVXR6TEVpWlBqbWY0LU53NlkwYUNOa19UczB3V3hWcHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of Americans have contracted an incurable fungus on the West Coast being dubbed a new 'epidemic'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever, which got its name because a majority of cases are found in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-ba44dbe0-a8fa-11ef-8ae9-cbfe30a1657c"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-ba452a00-a8fa-11ef-8ae9-cbfe30a1657c" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, is a deadly lung infection that kills one in 100 people that contract it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In just 25 years, cases have climbed more than 1,200 percent in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first six months of 2025, there were more than 5,500 provisional cases reported in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts say if cases continue at the same rate, they will surpass last year's high of nearly 12,500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Arizona, there were more than 14,000 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14109511/Warning-young-men-infected-RINGWORM-barbers.html"&gt;reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of Valley Fever in 2024, up from 10,990 cases in 2023, marking an uptick of more than 27 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, Valley Fever cases are now at a record high and set to reach almost 30,000 for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which releases spores into the air when soil is disturbed. Health experts are warning people to avoid dusty outdoor environments as they could breathe in the coccidioides spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thousands of Californians have been struck down by incurable fungus on the West Coast dubbed 'new American epidemic'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Valley Fever cases peaked for the first time in a decade in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 20,970 recorded instances were the most on record for a single year since the last peak in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instances declined in 2022 but picked back up last year, and experts are concerned over an expected surge of the fungus in the coming decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates Valley Fever could infect more than half a million Americans each year in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency said that due to rising temperatures across the globe, the endemic region of the disease will spread north to include dry western areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts fear that it could be endemic in 17 states by 2100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California Department of Public Health director Dr Erica Pan said: 'California had a record year for Valley fever in 2024 and, so far, case counts are high in 2025. Valley fever is a serious illness that's here to stay in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to remind Californians, travelers to California, and their healthcare providers to watch for signs and symptoms of Valley fever to help detect it early.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no person-to-person transmission of the disease, for which there is currently no preventative vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever can often resolve on its own without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For more severe or persistent cases, antifungal medications are used to manage symptoms and prevent the infection from worsening or spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that Valley Fever can often be missed by doctors or misdiagnosed as pneumonia as it presents similar symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, aching muscles and breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include night sweats, joint aches and a red rash, usually on the legs but occasionally on the chest, arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease is often underdiagnosed due to mild symptoms, the CDC estimates that the true burden is around 206,000 to 360,000 cases per year - 10 to 18 times more than reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fungus spore is whipped up into the air when the soil is disturbed by the wind or digging. When humans or animals breathe in the spores, they travel through the respiratory tract and into the lungs where they reproduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But up to 10 percent of infections become severe and take months to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these cases, known as disseminated coccidioidomycosis, the disease can spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, including the brain, skin and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it infects the membranes and fluid around the brain it can cause life-threatening meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the disease from reaching advanced stages, Dr Pan advises: 'If you have been sick with symptoms like cough, fever, trouble breathing, and tiredness for more than seven to ten days, please talk to a healthcare provider about Valley fever, especially if you've been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, there were approximately 200 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths each year from 1999 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests the rise and spread of Valley fever may be linked to changes in climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wet winters after droughts help the fungus grow, and dry, windy weather in the following summer and fall can help the fungus get into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shaun Yang, the director for molecular microbiology and pathogen genomics at the UCLA Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, told SFGate: 'I think climate change is the main reason to explain this type of dramatic explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The infection was dubbed Valley Fever because 97 percent of cases are found in Arizona and California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think anything else can explain this type of phenomenon. This kind of very wet and dry pattern definitely is perfect for this fungus to grow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no proven treatment for Valley Fever and patients are usually prescribed rest and given therapies to manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe antifungal medications, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that show these treatments are effective - and antifungal drugs come with the potential for serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1996, the Valley Fever Center for Excellence at the University of Arizona, was established in order to address the problems caused by the coccidioides fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two-thirds of all Valley Fever infections in the US occur in Arizona, mostly in the urban areas surrounding Phoenix and Tucson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the University of Arizona &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14106151/cdc-report-pet-dogs-spread-rare-disease.html"&gt;Valley Fever &lt;/a&gt;Center for Excellence secured $33 million from the National Institute of Health to pursue a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its director, Dr John Galgiani, helped develop one for dogs THAT is still undergoing licensing for commercial marketing. But it is hoped the VACCINE could translate to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been thinking about a human vaccine all along but taking this through the dog is really a very useful step to show proof of the concept, making the idea of taking it to humans that much more attractive,' Mr Galgiani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOaVppQ2dvaXlLbWFCbDJaZENLYzBtTXA1MlJrdmo1azBCTWhMeHhOdmpxMXZ3ZFJ3ck9qbUtxN09uYzBPbXJRNnVCdDFZU3pwNzByUWx4ZWdBNXo5RU9FVXNreGtoNlN0czZRZ0pOeFFsUVJUMnpndnpKb21VQVozaGx0Z3o0YXZtOVFzNnk2cHlFQVJXV1FieUlTSGxHWG9WblVMYUlpVWd1RXVI0gGyAUFVX3lxTE8yZTNGQnJBQnB4eWJXWlJqSEVHWEVBUjdUSGdnSUNJY3JOc05wenBYdng0cVMxcEhXLUdTbU1aNWhHanY0Y2hkYnh5RmVfX1l6REpOWklCV2RNNmdacGVtMElZSmFwWEg0Sm96NUN4MEtGRlMxajQwR1hod1JEcDJoaTFpZlBBNkRKUHVuUFBsbTgwVXR6TEVpWlBqbWY0LU53NlkwYUNOa19UczB3V3hWcHc</guid></item><item><title>试图重新定义死亡的医生-新闻自由</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1YUTE1LTlTSk82T21HeFRYVl9GdVZnMWFrRDNzRVRmU1RyRlNWeUVPeXRES0RYc1dtXzZ4bzRLRFp5WUlkTGI1Z09odldRckJyWC1wb0Z1QUNxNDdRSXJEN2NpM3RFN1JWbXUyZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the old days, a person was considered dead when the heart stopped. Then, in 1968, a group of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oG8JSsQhb602k-vRAPOE5xcST3ZVPYrZ/view?usp=sharing" rel&gt;Harvard professors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; decided that people could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be considered dead when the brain stopped. Now, three doctors from New York are advocating that we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/opinion/organ-donors-death-definition.html" rel&gt;expand the definition of death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to include what they call “irreversibly comatose patients on life support.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does this mean? And what’s with the drive to label more people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;deceased&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this sounds like an academic concern—the kind of subject reserved for philosophers and priests or even medical ethicists like me. But don’t be fooled. This is a profoundly relevant debate for anyone with a healthy kidney, heart, lung, or liver that could be transplanted to save the life of someone else. In other words: The question of when a person is dead affects almost everyone alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For as long as we humans have walked the earth, we have, like all animals, died. And for millennia, this was fairly straightforward. To the observer keeping watch at the sickbed, granddad would breathe his last and his skin would start to turn ashen and cold. Within a couple of hours his body would go stiff, signaling certain death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From Homer to Tolstoy, historian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/93116/9780394751566" rel&gt;Philippe Ariès&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; argues, death’s debut was obvious and followed a predictable pattern. “The common, ordinary death does not come as a surprise,” he writes, “even when it is the accidental result of a wound or the effect of too great an emotion.” But this wasn’t true for everyone, Ariès notes. The educated and the elite had trouble recognizing death for what it was and dismissed signs of death as mere superstition. On that point, perhaps little has changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us moderns, the traditional understanding of death has been the irreversible stoppage of heart and lung function. Why both? Because the heart and lungs work together to pump oxygen-rich blood all around the body, including the brain. If the heart stops, the lungs are certain to follow suit, and vice versa. This is probably the way your great-grandparents died. This is the way most people have died for most of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When breathing machines—called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.4187/respcare.01420?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed" rel&gt;mechanical ventilators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—came into widespread usage in the 1960s, doctors faced a new dilemma. What happened if you put a patient who had stopped breathing on a ventilator, only to find out the patient had such severe brain damage from a lack of oxygen that she could never possibly breathe again on her own? What if you scanned the head and discovered that there was zero blood flow to the brain, and the brain was starting to decompose? Were such patients dead? Near dead?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Free Press</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:23:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1YUTE1LTlTSk82T21HeFRYVl9GdVZnMWFrRDNzRVRmU1RyRlNWeUVPeXRES0RYc1dtXzZ4bzRLRFp5WUlkTGI1Z09odldRckJyWC1wb0Z1QUNxNDdRSXJEN2NpM3RFN1JWbXUyZA</guid></item><item><title>随着对美国动物爆发的担忧加剧， “变异鹿”身上出现了可怕的肉泡- UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOUm5NdXZZMzVxZm5HSTRnVXl2ZV9lMDNoNU8tUXZnbjc4RzJMdjBlTEpHRmtHZ0hSemQ3LVNjM3RPQkZfR294ZVZSbnRCRmtKejFSeXQtZUE5QTFiZzFjNy0xTFhJcU5KNzZ4eTE1SzhUVk5RVC1mRnVLZjFxTU1oTnNlbWFfSklvZ0R1UlZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 'mutant species' trend across America continues with 'black-bubbled' deer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Even though we've all only just recovered from Colorado's poor &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/news/animals/expert-issues-warning-pet-owners-frankenstein-rabbits-951639-20250813"&gt;'Frankenstein rabbits'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/news/animals/squirrel-warts-disease-reddit-usa-253592-20250818"&gt;'zombie' squirrels&lt;/a&gt;, now it's time to introduce some other growth-ravaged mammals over in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Pictures spreading - for lack of a better word - through &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; showcase several warty deer going about their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One person took to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to share a deer that they'd spotted in their backyard a month ago, writing: "Not sure what’s wrong with her or how we can help.

They vary in size (though most are just a few centimeters in diameter), are typically dark in color and bare of fur, and often appear fissured or lumpy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They add that most infected deers 'have just a small number of small fibromas, but cases of large fibromas and fibromas widespread about the hide are not uncommon'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is deer fibroma contagious to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Similar to CRPV, deer fibroma cannot be spread to humans or other animals outside of other deer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Kristin Mansfield, a wildlife veterinarian in Washington state, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/lumps-growths-washington-deer"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; FOX13 that deer can spread the virus to one another by sharing either the same feeding ground, sleeping spot, or rubbing posts - typically a tree bucks use to mark their territory during mating season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They can, however, initiate illnesses such as Lyme disease in populated areas, which crosses species through the ticks they carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mercifully, the animals' immune system beats away the virus, and the warts eventually shrink and disappear after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can deer fibroma be treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The virus cannot cross over to humans, thankfully (Reddit)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So far, there is no effective treatment for the condition, with it being possible for lumps on captive animals to be removed surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the best course of action is to leave the infected deer be. In worst-case scenarios, if the warts are rendering the deer unable to eat, move or see, then euthanasia is considered as a possible option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is possibly causing the rise in 'animal mutations'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One of the possible reasons why these conditions are spreading is climate change, as warmer weather is allowing mosquitoes and ticks to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alluding to the ramifications of climate change, Dr. Omer Awan of the University of Maryland School of Medicine &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15017759/Mutant-deer-horrifying-flesh-bubbles-US-outbreak.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Daily Mail: "These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:21:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOUm5NdXZZMzVxZm5HSTRnVXl2ZV9lMDNoNU8tUXZnbjc4RzJMdjBlTEpHRmtHZ0hSemQ3LVNjM3RPQkZfR294ZVZSbnRCRmtKejFSeXQtZUE5QTFiZzFjNy0xTFhJcU5KNzZ4eTE1SzhUVk5RVC1mRnVLZjFxTU1oTnNlbWFfSklvZ0R1UlZB</guid></item><item><title>欧洲创纪录的蚊媒疾病活动可能标志着新常态- CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPX3prd1dBV0wzQmpfbHVZaGtWWE9vckZMdUxUZXdoaFV2RXpVdVBkMlkyZU53MFZiT2NneWdsMEhEZUdXRkpmUXp3dUoyTlp2OFEyTktqa2tyUzRTVHVBNjUtamgtQTJnVS1PY0xGOHhZZjVlWjZuMHhPX29vemQyUHdhR1dacHgwejYtYm5TRndNeHh6aTcwNFhNbURrWmJFR00xTWFRN2owS25vakxacUpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Record activity this summer involving two mosquito-borne diseases—chikungunya and West Nile virus (WNV)—suggests the European region is entering a new normal, driven by climate shifts, officials from the &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/world-mosquito-day-2025-europe-sets-new-records-mosquito-borne-diseases-ecdc-supporting"&gt;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)&lt;/a&gt; said today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with its disease updates, the agency urged countries to mount robust and coordinated responses to protect the public. The ECDC's latest assessment comes on the 125th annual observance of World Mosquito Day, an event designed to raise awareness about the threat of diseases from mosquitoes and ways people can protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australia-based &lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/world-mosquito-day"&gt;World Mosquito Program&lt;/a&gt; estimates that mosquito-borne diseases kill 1 million people each year and infect as many as 700 million. For dengue alone this year, 3.6 million cases with more than 1,900 deaths have been reported across 94 countries and territories, with a notable surge in countries in the Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Record chikungunya outbreaks; disease expands north&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the World Health Organization issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chikungunya/quick-takes-who-chikungunya-warning-mpox-gambia-more-h5n1-california-dairy-cows"&gt;chikungunya alert&lt;/a&gt; amid new outbreaks in the Indian Ocean and Europe, urging countries to avoid a repeat of a surge two decades ago.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;An ongoing chikungunya outbreak in Foshan, China, has sickened at least 8,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECDC said the &lt;em&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes that can spread chikungunya now have a foothold in 16 European countries and 369 regions, up sharply from just 114 regions a decade ago. Officials said mosquito presence and travel-related cases make outbreaks more likely. Rising temperatures, longer summer seasons, milder winters, and changing rainfall patterns are creating more favorable conditions for the mosquito populations to thrive, the group added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Rendi-Wagner, MD, ECDC's director, said, "Europe is entering a new phase—where longer, more widespread and more intense transmission of mosquito-borne diseases is becoming the new normal. ECDC is working closely with all Member States to provide tailored support and timely public health guidance to strengthen Europe's response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 27 outbreaks have been reported in Europe, which the ECDC said is a record for the region. France has confirmed 111 infections, with 7 in Italy. Though most outbreaks are in the south and southeast, the first locally acquired chikungunya case has been reported in France's Alsace region, which officials said is an exceptional occurrence at that latitude and is signaling a northward expansion of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WNV at 3-year high, with 8 countries affected&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the distribution of WNV cases in Europe has shifted over the past 10 years, with illnesses reported in new areas every year. Regions of Italy and Romania this year have reported their first WNV cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European officials have recorded the most WNV cases in 3 years, and ECDC officials expect infections to keep rising until a seasonal peak this month or next. So far, eight counties have reported 335 locally acquired WNV cases, 19 of them fatal. Most of the cases are in Italy, with Greece also reporting illnesses in the double digits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a fact of life: Some people age better than others. Some ease into their 90s with mind and body intact, while others battle diabetes, Alzheimer's or mobility issues decades earlier. Some can withstand a bad fall or bout of the flu with ease, while others never leave the hospital again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;New University of Colorado Boulder-led research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02269-0" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/i&gt;, sheds light on why that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, an international team of co-authors identifies more than 400 genes associated with accelerated aging across seven different sub-types. The study reveals that different groups of genes underlie different kinds of disordered aging, a.k.a. frailty, ranging from cognitive decline to mobility issues to social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings lend support to what is known as the "geroscience hypothesis"—the idea that to treat the multiple chronic illnesses that come with aging, we must treat aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To be able to identify treatments to stop or reverse accelerated biological aging, you need to know what the underlying biology is," said Isabelle Foote, first author on the paper and a postdoctoral researcher at CU's Institute for Behavioral Genetics. "This is the largest study yet to use genetics to try to do that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Redefining 'frailty'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study centers around "frailty," a catch-all term for the "multisystem physiological decline" that often comes with aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40% of U.S. adults over age 65 are considered frail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically assess frailty using a 30-point index that measures things like walking speed, grip strength, number of diagnosed illnesses and amount of social activity. The problem, said Foote, is that two people can get the same high frailty score even though one is cognitively sharp but can't walk and another is in good physical health but has a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/poor+memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;poor memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This lack of distinction has made it hard for doctors to make recommendations and for scientists to pinpoint the underlying causes of unhealthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aging is not just one thing. There are many ways to be frail," said Dr. Kenneth Rockwood, a leading expert in frailty, based at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada and co-author on the study. "The question then becomes: What genes are involved?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, the team conducted a "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genome-wide+association+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genome-wide association study&lt;/a&gt;," analyzing DNA and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health information&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank and other public datasets to see which genes were associated with 30 frailty symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They identified 408 genes associated with accelerated aging/frailty, a significant increase from the 37 genes previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some genes, they found, were strongly linked to certain subtypes of unhealthy aging, including: disability; poor cognition; &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic problems&lt;/a&gt;; multiple diseases; generally unhealthy lifestyle; and limited social support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the SP1 gene, associated with immune function and Alzheimer's disease, was strongly associated with the broad "poor cognition" subtype, whereas the FTO gene, a gene known to be associated with obesity, seemed to underlie several different categories of unhealthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What this paper does is not only identify sub-facets of disordered aging but also demonstrate that there is very different biology underlying them," said senior author Andrew Grotzinger, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at CU Boulder. "The tangible next step is to figure out how to treat this underlying biology."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;An anti-aging pill?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the authors suggest that clinical measurements of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/frailty/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;—which often show up long before specific diseases—be expanded to include the six subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way, someone diagnosed as cognitively frail could be guided toward therapies to prevent dementia, while someone frail in the metabolic domain might take steps to prevent diabetes or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foote envisions a day when people could get a "polygenic risk score," offering more detailed insight into what kind of unhealthy aging they are prone to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the holy grail, she says, would be to identify the molecular pathways that drive aging itself and develop therapies to put the brakes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a single anti-aging pill on the horizon? Not likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could there one day be a pill to treat a package of age-related metabolic issues, and another to address numerous cognitive issues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a tantalizing idea, said Grotzinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This paper suggests that it's probably not going to be a single magic pill to address all the diseases that come with aging, but maybe it doesn't need to be hundreds anymore."&lt;/p&gt;

However, the infection is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MU Health Care infectious disease specialist Christian Rojas Moreno said there are &lt;a href="https://www.komu.com/news/midmissourinews/brain-eating-infection-is-extremely-rare-despite-billions-of-amoeba-exposures-expert-says/article_0b7ff4f5-79fd-42b9-96ad-5bb771511a7c.html" target="_blank"&gt;billions of exposures to the amoeba every year&lt;/a&gt;, but those exposures result in 10 or fewer cases annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key risk factor is exposure to warm, fresh water, which patients have typically encountered during recreational water activities. The state health department said the man who died had been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks in the days before he became ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".modal-25ffdb05-26eb-4a03-861f-5dac77916ca0"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department did not indicate there is reason to avoid any particular body of water, though — and Rojas Moreno said the amoeba is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This amoeba is present pretty much everywhere, especially in warm, fresh water," Rojas Moreno said. "So, it is there, especially during summertime in high temperatures. There is a risk, but it is a low risk — very low risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of 'brain-eating' amoeba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1070106" class="tncms-block"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1070106" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

                                &lt;p class="tnt-summary"&gt;A Missouri adult is in intensive care after contracting a "brain-eating" amoeba, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rojas Moreno said symptoms of the "brain-eating" infection typically start as a headache and progress. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said people who experience the following symptoms after swimming in a warm body of water should seek medical attention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stiff neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altered mental status&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hallucinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically start between one and 12 days after the exposure, Rojas Moreno said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with these symptoms will likely be checked for other, more common causes of brain infections before a physician checks for the amoeba, Rojas Moreno said. Because the infection is so rare, Rojas Moreno said physicians likely won't check for the amoeba first unless the patient has a clear history of exposure to it in warm, fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rojas Moreno emphasized that people can prevent the infection by avoiding bodies of warm, fresh water. If exposure to a body of water like this is unavoidable, Rojas Moreno said people should hold their nose or use nose clips to try and prevent water from entering the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection cannot be caused by swallowing water that contains the amoeba, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult to predict when it will happen again, but potentially there is amoeba in any body of warm, fresh water," Rojas Moreno said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient was infected with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt;, which is naturally present in warm freshwater and is often found during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms get worse pretty rapidly and most people actually pass away within about five days," Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Epidemiologist Nathan Koffarnus previously told 5 On Your Side.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human infection has historically been extremely rare, with only 167 reported cases of the infection in the United States between 1962-2024. The last time a Naegleria fowleri infection was &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/ea19a071-5c03-495c-9b62-69db69078d4e/missouri-dhss-confirms-case-of-rare-brain-infection#:~:text=Naegleria%2520fowleri%2520is%2520a%2520microscopic,care%2520unit%2520of%2520a%2520hospital." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;confirmed in Missouri was in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The only other confirmed case in the state was in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Naegleria fowleri infections have historically been rare, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; warns that warming temperatures and increasingly frequent floods caused by human-induced climate change are making infections occur more often.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, which is outside the livable range of competing microorganisms, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; research published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in the waterways through flooding, creating the perfect storm for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

While this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; predominantly affects older individuals (aged 50 and above), it is increasingly being diagnosed in younger people. A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggests that compared to people born in 1950, those born in 1990 have twice the risk of developing colon cancer. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption play a crucial role in the early onset. Early diagnosis is crucial for treatment outcomes and survival. This is why awareness around the disease, its symptoms, and prevention is crucial. Here are some of the warning symptoms of colon cancer you should not ignore. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any changes in your poop, do not ignore them. Yes, that's right. How you poop really matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7079267/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have consistently shown that colorectal patients complain of changes in bowel habits. Any changes, such as constipation, diarrhea, narrowing, or frequency of your poop, should not be dismissed. If these symptoms persist lasts more than a few weeks, you should consult your healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Blood in your poop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal bleeding is a hallmark sign of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1920716/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that rectal bleeding, along with other factors, is predictive of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice blood in the poop on toilet paper, consult your doctor right away. The presence of blood can appear as dark or bright red patches in the poop. Though other conditions, such as hemorrhoids, too, could lead to rectal bleeding, it is important to find out the cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Belly pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ache in your abdominal area is another significant sign of colon cancer. If you experience pain in the belly, with no known cause, talk to your doctor. A 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that abdominal pain was the most common symptom (63%) in young patients with colorectal cancer. The pain may feel like cramps or bloating, and won't go away, and hurt a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is a common and often early symptom of colon cancer. If you notice sudden weight loss without a known reason, it should not be dismissed. Weight loss, without even changing your diet or fitness levels, should be a cause of concern. This sign is noticeable, and you shouldn't ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Foods that help you poop better and relieve constipation in the morning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Constant fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience persistent tiredness, it's a red flag. Feeling tired, even after a good night's sleep, is a common symptom in people with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4999562/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is not normal.

              &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. is officially waging a war against pediatricians. This week, he went after the American Academy of Pediatrics for rebuffing the federal government and continuing to endorse covid-19 vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1957914911415153107"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday afternoon, the health secretary and longtime anti-vaxxer accused the AAP of bowing to corporate pressure in making the recommendations. He also claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recent decision to oppose pediatric covid-19 shots represented a return to “gold-standard science.” The AAP, by contrast, has maintained that covid-19 remains a serious health threat to children, particularly younger kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The CDC’s about-face on covid vaccines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would remove its recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women to receive the covid-19 vaccine, including annual booster shots. Though Kennedy was flanked by NIH director Jay Bhattacharya and FDA chief Marty Makary, the announcement featured no actual CDC staff. Several days later, the CDC officially &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; its language to state that these groups may get these vaccines in consultation with their doctors (the previous guidance said they should).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some countries have started to ease off their covid-19 vaccine recommendations for children. And the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel (outside experts who guide vaccine policy in the U.S.) was set to discuss their recommendations for the fall vaccination schedule in June, which would have included the covid-19 shots. Kennedy rushed ahead of the panel, however, and he provided no evidence at the time to justify the change. The next month, he unilaterally removed all members of the advisory panel and replaced them with members more supportive of his anti-vaccination views.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why the AAP still supports covid shots for kids&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, the AAP issued its own vaccine guidance, which, for the first time in 30 years, differs significantly from the CDC’s stance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;strongly recommends &lt;/a&gt;that all children ages 6 through 23 months old receive at least one covid-19 shot, citing their generally higher risk of having a severe infection. Older children are also recommended to get vaccinated if they fall into certain groups, including children at higher risk of severe covid-19 (such as those with weaker immune systems), children who have never been vaccinated at all, and children living with other people at high risk of severe covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP also took another swipe at HHS for its &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;recent decision&lt;/a&gt; to recommend against vaccines containing thimerosal, a preservative that anti-vaxxers have long alleged causes autism despite many studies finding otherwise. It continued to endorse the small minority of vaccines made with the ingredient and &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/pediatrics/20250819/pediatricians-split-with-cdc-recommend-covid-shots-for-kids#:~:text=After%20the%20ACIP%20said%20in%20June%20that%20the%20U.S.%20should%20not%20administer%20influenza%20vaccines%20containing%20thimerosal%2C%20a%20safe%20preservative%2C%20the%20AAP%20added%20a%20recommendation%20that%20%E2%80%9Cinfluenza%20vaccination%20...%20not%20be%20delayed%20to%20obtain%20a%20specific%20product%2C%20including%20a%20thimerosal%2Dfree%20product.%E2%80%9D"&gt;recommended against&lt;/a&gt; delaying this year’s flu shots to remove these products from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We extensively reviewed the most recently available data about covid-19 risks in kids, as well as safety and effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines. It’s clear they are very safe for all populations,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP’s Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the AAP. “Among the reasons we decided to move to a risk-based recommendation for healthy older children is the fact that the hospitalization rate for young children and children with underlying medical conditions remains high, in line with rates for many of the other vaccine-preventable diseases for which we vaccinate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy, however, alleged in his X post that the AAP’s decision was possibly a part of a “pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP’s Big Pharma benefactors.” And he called for the AAP to disclose any potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For starters, the AAP does disclose its funders, some of which do include vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer. These funders don’t change the reality that while covid-19 is generally less dangerous to children than older adults, it isn’t harmless. Covid-19 has sickened children, sometimes severely, and in rare cases, has even been &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/154/Supplement%203/e2024067043K/199735/Characteristics-of-Children-Ages-1-17-Who-Died-of?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;fatal&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, reams of scientific data have consistently shown that covid-19 vaccines greatly reduce the risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is also hardly one to talk about financial conflicts of interest, given that he has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care/397452/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-elizabeth-warren"&gt;greatly profited&lt;/a&gt; from crusading against vaccine makers. And in fact, many of RFK’s ideological allies and anti-vaccination proponents &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/05/12/993615185/for-some-anti-vaccine-advocates-misinformation-is-part-of-a-business"&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; their own, often unregulated, health products and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/rfk-jr-aide-attacks-u-s-health-system-as-corrupt-while-running-company-that-promotes-alternatives"&gt;alternative treatments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the battle between the AAP and the revamped HHS under RFK. Jr, I’d much rather back the side that doesn’t demonize vaccines every chance it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Updating the vaccine means it will more closely match the variants of the coronavirus currently circulating and causing infections. Last year’s COVID vaccine was updated to target the KP.2 strain (also from the JN.1 lineage), which is no longer in circulation in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Nashville, Tennessee’s Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says the newly reformulated vaccines for 2025-2026 are expected to provide good protection against the virus for the upcoming respiratory illness season.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;A key reason: “All the currently circulating variants are children, if you will, of the omicron strain,” he says. The updated vaccines “should cover the strains that are circulating now and that we anticipate will be circulating this winter.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the vaccines are best at preventing severe disease that leads to hospitalizations, and not necessarily infections, Schaffner adds.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“So we can still get milder illnesses, but particularly for people in high-risk groups, it’s very important to be vaccinated, because high-risk people are those who are at risk of getting more severe disease and requiring hospitalization, and that’s exactly what it is that the vaccines are designed to prevent,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Older adults are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People 65 and older have accounted for roughly &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/covid-pandemic-5-year-anniversary/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/updated-seasonal-covid-vaccines.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="covid 5 year anniversary"&gt;94 percent of COVID-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. Also at increased risk are individuals with underlying health conditions, such as asthma, &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/heart-disease/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/updated-seasonal-covid-vaccines.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="heart disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and many more.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;When will the COVID-19 vaccines be available?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Public health experts expect the vaccines to be available in the fall, as in previous years, though an exact date is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Schaffner says a mid- to late-September launch is “entirely appropriate,” because you don’t want to get the vaccine too far ahead of the typical winter peak.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“You want that protection to last throughout the entire winter season,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Last winter’s peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations was in early January, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Officials say a traveler from out of state who visited two Wisconsin gas stations may have exposed others to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said the potential exposures affect those who were at the Flying J Travel Center in Roberts and the Pilot Travel Center in Beloit on Aug. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposure window for Flying J was 7:15 a.m. to 10 a.m., while those at Pilot may have been exposed between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge anyone who may have been exposed to confirm their immunization status. Symptoms of the disease include a runny nose, high fever, tiredness, cough, irritation and discoloration of the eyes and a red rash with raised bumps. Anyone exposed on Aug. 4 would likely see symptoms by Aug. 25, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with symptoms is asked to avoid public places and notify their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials in that state say declining vaccination rates are leading to a rise in measles cases. In 2019, more than 92% of Minnesota kindergarteners were fully vaccinated. In 2024, that number had decreased to 87%. Last year, there were 70 cases in Minnesota, about one-third of the total cases in the state since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

No other information about the person or the person's condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-720455" class="body-graf"&gt;Officials believe the sick person was bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, the release said. Officials are investigating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9824f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Plague is caused by bacteria that are most often transmitted via bites from fleas that were already carrying the bacteria after picking it up from squirrels, chipmunks and other rodents, according to health officials. Dogs and cats could also bring plague-infected fleas into homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8fcae" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of plague usually include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, and show up within two weeks of exposure. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it's diagnosed early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffefad" class="body-graf"&gt;Public health officials in California monitor rodents in the area to determine if they carry plague, the release said. From 2021 to 2024, 41 rodents were found to have been exposed to the plague bacteria. Four additional rodents tested positive in 2025, all identified in the Tahoe Basin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e984" class="body-graf"&gt;El Dorado County officials noted how rare human cases of plague are, with the last reported case in the South Lake Tahoe area in 2020. Prior to that, two people tested positive for plague in 2015 after exposure in Yosemite National Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bfc80" class="body-graf"&gt;"Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County," said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County's Acting Director of Public Health. "It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bbdfc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In order to prevent contracting plague, officials warned that people and pets should not touch squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents, especially those that are dead or injured. People should not camp near where dead rodents were observed and should wear long pants tucked into boots and spray bug repellant to reduce flea exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:53:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNR3dUbExBbXBSMnJzNGczQVRQbXg1bVZxcHV5dlBPTFctVTgyZ1JqZG1wNEpjMzFTVFlvZU14dm5IR0g1V2pMaDJXT0c3UjFHV3FJdENzaGpuX21PdFFYSzhkQ01OX2I2N2VsV0w1Y0t0TktsRFhYeVlmWWNydmFOaVF0VlI3a0tzTTl5UGl2c09lVE5iZkt0RXBVdDNkZHN5THFhVy03aWkwMjlyUl9qRGtDM3JCOXZBMUHSAVZBVV95cUxNQktDdG5ibnhoZkpkVHBxY3IzbXZuaEFQMllFOWpHMjdpSnBrT0dNT2x1dnYwamgtMnBOS1pRRXhqa3VBT2hpX3dEdF8yYVdqR3VoSy03dw</guid></item><item><title>1990年麻疹爆发表明疾病如何咆哮-纽约时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOb2UzNlNDMkxFQ3k1NnptM3I3QkE3c2RaTVNBb243Z2NMbnVDQ2ZNTjRlS1hLSjJnVkJoZFRmMy1IVjFqd2F5aUVqdWZIQlJiSDllSFU1RXVGR0xWNzFmejJPMEt3enQzQmZ6RFhKamZqQmNsdDUtS0FobXptMjE4ZWR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:50:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOb2UzNlNDMkxFQ3k1NnptM3I3QkE3c2RaTVNBb243Z2NMbnVDQ2ZNTjRlS1hLSjJnVkJoZFRmMy1IVjFqd2F5aUVqdWZIQlJiSDllSFU1RXVGR0xWNzFmejJPMEt3enQzQmZ6RFhKamZqQmNsdDUtS0FobXptMjE4ZWR3</guid></item><item><title>根据神经科学家的说法， 7种日常习惯会让你悄无声息地变得不那么聪明- VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOUVFqaExBN2M4TjJJaHNYSzVKQVdweURvRG9ZUkd6RHdKc0R6enFvcV84emVLdUE0eXRIQnVGVXlUdzVPU0p0bzN6eGROMUZoa2tyQ3lrV1pZWWN3MTZ1Y2ptLXRGVHN4ZEg5TngyaWNNX0FRejBydWNFQkVnWF9tdDlzbXlIdlVFY0hmUjJKYi14UTF6aGM0OWEtMkNyQUpzLTJ4X2RjekVyXzVwZl9vMHFua1hwejFt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="107"&gt;Crafting a sharp mind isn’t just about what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="107"&gt;It’s about what you do—every day—without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="109" data-end="228"&gt;Here are seven daily habits that can quietly dull your thinking (and what to do instead), according to neuroscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="230" data-end="261"&gt;1. Chronic sleep restriction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="336"&gt;Cutting sleep to “make time” is like siphoning fuel from your own engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;When you regularly sleep less than you need, attention, reaction time, and decision-making all take a hit—effects that stack up day after day. In a classic dose–response study, people limited to 6 hours a night for two weeks &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/uep/assets/user-content/documents/VanDongen_etal_Sleep_26_2_2003.pdf?.com"&gt;performed as poorly on vigilance tasks&lt;/a&gt; as those who went a full night without sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;Sleep also helps your brain file memories. During both slow-wave and REM sleep, the brain consolidates and reorganizes new information—think of it like saving work before your laptop dies. Skip good sleep and you don’t just feel foggy; you remember less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="338" data-end="685"&gt;As sleep scientist Matthew Walker puts it, “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.” I’ve learned the hard way that no hack beats a stable sleep window. Aim for a consistent 7–9 hours and a regular bedtime/waketime—even on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1309" data-end="1333"&gt;2. Media multitasking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1335" data-end="1443"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but your brain doesn’t truly multitask—it switches. And every switch has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Heavy media multitaskers tend to show poorer performance on tasks that require filtering distractions and maintaining focus. In one well-known study, people who juggled lots of media streams were &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0903620106?.com"&gt;worse at ignoring irrelevant information&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a hit to cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley sums it up: our “brains &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534437/the-distracted-mind/?.com"&gt;aren’t built for multitasking&lt;/a&gt;.” Translation: constant tab-hopping trains you to be distractible. Try batching similar tasks and using do-not-disturb blocks for 25–50 minutes. Your working memory will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1445" data-end="1759"&gt;Quick fix I use when I catch myself ping-ponging: write the one thing I’m doing on a sticky note and keep it in view until it’s done. Low-tech, high yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2221" data-end="2241"&gt;3. Sedentary days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2243" data-end="2312"&gt;Long sits aren’t just hard on your back. They’re rough on your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2314" data-end="2677"&gt;Regular aerobic activity increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—fertilizer for neurons—and is linked to better memory. In a randomized trial, a year of moderate walking increased hippocampal volume and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1015950108?.com"&gt;improved spatial memory&lt;/a&gt; in older adults. Movement remodels the very structure that supports learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2679" data-end="2921"&gt;You don’t need to morph into a marathoner. Sprinkle in brisk 10-minute walks, take calls standing, and chase a light sweat most days. On photo days, I build in a loop around the block between edits; creativity reliably loosens up right after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2923" data-end="2953"&gt;4. Ultra-processed snacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2955" data-end="3104"&gt;Ultra-processed foods—think packaged sweets, refined snacks, cured meats—are easy to reach for and easy to overdo. The problem isn’t just waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;A large Brazilian cohort study found that higher intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2799140?.com"&gt;faster cognitive decline over ~8 years&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for total calories and other factors. Experimental work also links diets high in sugar and saturated fat with impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;You don’t have to be perfect. Just protect your “default” choices: fruit or nuts visible on the counter, a prepped grain-and-veg bowl in the fridge, and a rule I use on busy edit days—eat “ingredients” first, snacks second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3106" data-end="3473"&gt;Harvard’s summary of the evidence puts it bluntly: the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/eating-ultra-processed-foods-tied-to-cognitive-decline?.com"&gt;less ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;, the better for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3842" data-end="3859"&gt;5. Dehydration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3861" data-end="3923"&gt;Mild dehydration can feel like “meh.” It also dents cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3925" data-end="4191"&gt;Reviews show that even ~2% body-water loss can &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22855911?.com"&gt;impair attention&lt;/a&gt;, executive function, and mood—even in healthy young adults. If your afternoon slump coincides with a dry mouth and a headache, it’s not just vibes; it’s physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4193" data-end="4462"&gt;What helps me: front-load water in the morning, sip with each coffee (one mug of water per mug of caffeine), and set a refill cue tied to natural breaks (after meetings, after a walk, before driving). Add a pinch of salt or a squeeze of citrus if plain water bores you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4464" data-end="4484"&gt;6. Chronic stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4486" data-end="4557"&gt;Short bursts of stress sharpen focus. Chronic stress does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4559" data-end="4884"&gt;Persistent elevations in stress hormones like cortisol can impair the hippocampus (memory) and prefrontal cortex (planning, attention). Over time, that means slower recall, more mental errors, and a hair-trigger distractibility. The neuroscience is clear across animal and human studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4559" data-end="4884"&gt;This doesn’t mean “be calm” on command. It means build daily off-ramps—10 nasal breaths before opening your inbox, a 15-minute walk after lunch, or a boundary that your evening news scroll stops an hour before bed. I also keep a “rumination pad” on my desk; dumping looping thoughts onto paper frees up bandwidth to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5210" data-end="5231"&gt;7. Nightly alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5233" data-end="5335"&gt;A glass of wine can feel like it smooths the edges. But nightly drinking is not a brain-neutral habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5337" data-end="5673"&gt;A massive UK Biobank imaging analysis (36,000+ adults) found a dose-dependent association between alcohol intake and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5.pdf?.com"&gt;reduced gray and white matter volume&lt;/a&gt;—even at light-to-moderate levels. The more frequent the intake, the more the brain changes. It’s correlational, but the pattern is consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5337" data-end="5673"&gt;If that sounds grim, here’s the move: pick your nights with intention and keep true off-days. I treat alcohol like dessert—occasional, deliberate, and not on autopilot. Your sleep (and next-day clarity) will likely improve immediately, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="0" data-end="19"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="21" data-end="110"&gt;You don’t need a brain implant to get smarter. You need fewer self-sabotaging defaults. Here’s a simple way to start: run a 14-day “clarity sprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="174" data-end="346"&gt;Pick one lever—sleep, focus, movement, food, water, stress, or alcohol. Define a tiny, boring rule for it. Think “lights out at 11 p.m.” not “fix my sleep forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="532"&gt;Decide the when, where, and how in advance. “When I close my laptop at 10:30, I set my phone to Do Not Disturb and plug it in across the room.” Clarity beats willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="534" data-end="778"&gt;Make your environment do the heavy lifting. Put the water bottle on your desk. Move snacks off the counter. Hide the distracting apps in a folder you never see. Reduce friction for the habit you want; add friction for the one you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="780" data-end="887"&gt;Track it with a single checkbox each day. No apps needed. Just a tiny streak on paper you can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="889" data-end="1033"&gt;At the end of two weeks, do a quick debrief. What felt easier? What still felt sticky? Did your recall, mood, or focus shift even a notch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1035" data-end="1152"&gt;Keep what worked. Then layer a second lever while keeping the first on autopilot. Stacking beats overhauling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1154" data-end="1323"&gt;Give yourself the “don’t miss twice” rule. Miss a night, a walk, or a water refill? Fine. Aim to catch the next rep. Consistency grows from rebounds, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1325" data-end="1535"&gt;Use identity language to lock it in. “I’m the kind of person who protects sleep.” “I’m the kind of person who finishes one task before opening another tab.” Brains follow stories. Write ones you can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1537" data-end="1811"&gt;Create if-then backups for real life. “If I feel the 3 p.m. slump, then I take a 5-minute walk and drink water before coffee.” “If I reach for a nightly drink out of habit, then I pour a sparkling water first and wait ten minutes. Default plans beat default impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1813" data-end="1913"&gt;Loop in one person you trust. Tell them your sprint goal. Public promises nudge private choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1915" data-end="2080"&gt;Traveling or slammed at work? Shrink the habit, don’t drop it. Five minutes of movement instead of thirty. One page read instead of ten. Keep the groove alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2082" data-end="2270"&gt;And remember why this matters. These aren’t moral choices; they’re bandwidth choices. Every good default you build buys you more clarity for the decisions that actually move your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2272" data-end="2429"&gt;Start tiny today. Protect one habit for two weeks. Then stack another. That’s how you quietly build a sharper mind—one small, repeatable win at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, deficiencies are not uncommon: 35% of adults in the United States are deficient in vitamin D, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, while even more are likely getting some but still less than they should.

So far, studies have not found an explicit benefit of taking high doses of vitamin D to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/vitamin-d-heart-health-where-benefits-begin-and-end" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/vitamin-d-heart-health-where-benefits-begin-and-end" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute" data-node-id="16.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;, but experts say it's still important to make sure you're getting the recommended daily dose.&lt;em data-node-id="16.5"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Boosted mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Low vitamin D has been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970300/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970300/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="scientifically linked to depression" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;scientifically linked to depression&lt;/a&gt;, and vitamin D supplements are sometimes used to treat it.

Plus, there’s the danger of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cancer" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Mangieri added that the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health (NIH)" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily vitamin D intake for children and adults of 600 to 800 international units (IU). “While I fully encourage a food-first approach,” she said, “when it comes to Vitamin D, a dietary supplement is often needed.” &lt;br data-node-id="25.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You can get both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 in supplement form. Vitamin D2 supplements are made by exposing the ergosterol in yeast to UV radiation, explained Prest, and vitamin D3 supplements come from the exposure of 7-dehydrocholesterol—obtained from lanolin in the wool of sheep—to UV radiation. “There is also an animal-free version of vitamin D3 made from lichen,” she added, which comes from algae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“For people following a vegan diet or avoiding certain animal products, they can contact the dietary supplement manufacturer to ask about the product’s ingredients, and how it was sourced and processed,” said Prest. It’s also important to note that vitamins and supplements aren’t FDA-regulated. If you need one, Prest recommended looking for a standalone vitamin D supplement versus a multi-vitamin to ensure you get enough of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Look for brands with the USP verification mark on the label or that have been third-party tested through programs like &lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=861943c2f1d2a67ad6ecc4583&amp;amp;id=0c85598e47&amp;amp;e=53e1cbc321" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=861943c2f1d2a67ad6ecc4583&amp;amp;id=0c85598e47&amp;amp;e=53e1cbc321" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="N" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SF Certified for Sport" data-node-id="28.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;SF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt; or Informed Choice,” Mangieri added. “By choosing supplements with these labels, you know that what is on the label is actually present in the product in the amounts stated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Most importantly, Mangieri suggested having a conversation with your doctor or a registered dietitian before starting the supplement.

Do mosquito-repelling plants really work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mosquitoes need standing water to lay their eggs. And they don't need much. Water in a bottle cap can provide an ideal breeding ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts repeatedly encourage residents to empty flower pots, bird baths and any outdoor item that holds standing water — including bromeliads — to stop mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some residents share ideas to make outdoor living more bearable by selecting mosquito-repelling plants for their landscape, especially citronella and lavendar. But do they really work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Certain plants do contain mosquito-repelling compounds,” says Liah Continentino, environmental horticulture agent with &lt;a href="https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/monroe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Florida/IFAS Extension Monroe County;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;University of Florida/IFAS Extension Monroe County&lt;/a&gt;. “But unless you’re extracting their oils and applying them like a spray, they’re not doing much just sitting in your garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Plants like eucalyptus, citronella, mint, basil, lavender and marigolds have oils that can deter mosquitoes. But the key word is ‘oils.’ These compounds need to be extracted and used in concentrated forms — like sprays — to be truly effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, mosquito-repelling plants are more myth than magic — at least when it comes to passive protection, UF said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;So what can Florida residents do to minimize mosquitoes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Don't give up when it comes to enjoy Florida outdoor living. There are some things you can do and some do involve plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reduce mosquito habitats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This includes regularly emptying plant saucers, bird baths, pet water bowls and bromeliads, as well as any other water-holding plants. Refreshing bird baths and pet bowls with clean water several times a week and flushing bromeliad cups with a hose can help prevent larvae from developing,” said Jennifer Pelham, UF/IFAS urban horticulture agent and director of UF/IFAS Extension Martin County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Use plants in your landscape to attract mosquito predators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For dragonflies, which are highly effective mosquito hunters, they are drawn to native aquatic plants.
