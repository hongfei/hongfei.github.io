"This is a supplementation in case of deficiency, and it is not intended to treat the virus. High doses of vitamin A can have serious consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Neither vitamin A nor cod liver oil will treat measles," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Poor diet linked to severe measles disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kennedy has claimed that poor nutrition plays a role in causing severe measles disease and that a healthy diet can lessen severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While malnutrition can be a factor in severe disease, malnutrition and nutritional deficits in measles patients have historically been seen in underdeveloped countries, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9651531/#:~:text=Undernutrition%20is%20a%20primary%20contributor,of%20childhood%20fatalities%20from%20measles.&amp;amp;text=Malnourished%20children%20are%20more%20likely,the%20nutritional%20status%20of%20children." target="_blank"&gt;studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that mass nutritional supplementation "followed by an increase in vaccination coverage" can reduce measles infection and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Certainly, good nutrition can promote a healthy immune system, and it's a good idea for everyone to try to maintain good nutrition, but it's certainly not a substitute for vaccination," Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told ABC News.

This is a surprise. They were once perfectly straight, thanks to braces that stayed on throughout three ungainly middle school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I asked a few friends in midlife whether they had noticed the same thing, and some reported that they, too, had newly crooked lower teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So I called Dr. Leila Jahangiri, chair of prosthodontics at New York University College of Dentistry, and asked her if this experience was common. It’s not unusual for teeth to “shift and drift” as you age, she said, and it tends to occur more in the bottom teeth than the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Not everyone’s teeth move as they age, she added, but if they do, common reasons include the loss of a tooth; gum disease, which can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/gum-periodontal-disease.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;make teeth unstable&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6018449/#:~:text=THE%20DIRECT%20CAUSES%20OF%20MANDIBULAR%20ANTERIOR%20CROWDING&amp;amp;text=The%20mandibular%20anterior%20crowding%20in%20adults%20can%20be%20explained%20as,with%20crowding%20of%20the%20incisors." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;wear on the teeth&lt;/a&gt; from things like grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But my conversation with Dr. Jahangiri got me wondering: Are there other surprising ways we change as we get older?

This can leave people extremely susceptible to other pathogens for weeks after an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The virus also attacks the immune system’s memory cells. These cells remember and recognize the pathogens you’ve encountered over the course of your life and protect against them, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has studied measles and immunity. Scientists call the phenomenon “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Everyone who gets sick from measles will experience some level of immune amnesia, Dr. Mina said. This happens on a spectrum. For some people, it might mean that coming down with the flu will keep them in bed for an extra day or two, he said. But others may lose far more immunity and wind up getting seriously sick from the viruses they encounter. This immune amnesia can last for around three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A real concern is you’re not just going to get measles and get sick, but within the next couple of years, your kid’s going to be really vulnerable to a lot of other stuff,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can also cause severe, long-term complications. About one in 1,000 children who develop measles will experience brain swelling, which can cause hearing and vision loss, intellectual disabilities and permanent brain damage. And people of any age &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/well/immunocompromised-disease.html" title=""&gt;who are immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt; are at greater risk for developing a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/114/5/e657/67706/A-New-Complication-of-Stem-Cell-Transplantation?redirectedFrom=PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specific type of brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; that can occur for up to a year after they recover, said Dr. Milstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, the newly minted health and human services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The families that I touch base with in Gaines County — they are fearful and concerned,” said Dr. Montanez, who practices at Texas Tech University Health Science Center.

Surgery and several grueling rounds of chemotherapy and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; had failed to stop the cancer, which had spread to other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m not a crying man, but my wife and I shed some tears on the couch that day,” said Story, now 53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There was one final option, however: He could join an unusual clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston that had just started recruiting patients. Highly experimental — and with no guarantee of success — the trial involved getting a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fecal-transplant-pill-fda-approval-rcna81779" target="_blank"&gt;fecal transplant&lt;/a&gt; from a patient with advanced cancer who had been completely cured by immunotherapy. The idea was that the unique populations of gut bacteria found within the stool might help kick-start the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/melanoma-new-immunotherapy-cancer-treatment-rcna60468" target="_blank"&gt; immune system&lt;/a&gt; to better recognize and fight the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It came with its own risks, but Story agreed to enroll in the trial. “I knew I was kind of a guinea pig, but the only other option was staying at home, and I wasn’t going to make it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250312-tim-story-mb-1004-21cb59.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-tim-story-mb-1004-21cb59.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250312-tim-story-mb-1004-21cb59.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-tim-story-mb-1004-21cb59.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-tim-story-mb-1004-21cb59.jpg" alt="Tim Story cancer microbiomes"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Story with his wife, Jenny. “I’m not a crying man, but my wife and I shed some tears on the couch that day,” he said of the day in 2022 he was told he had only months to live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Annie Flanagan for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Story didn’t know it at the time, but his participation in the trial would help advance a new frontier of cancer medicine: using the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gut-bacteria-may-trigger-binge-eating-weight-gain-rcna159043" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; to unleash the full potency of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The immune system and the microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early on in his treatment, Story was given an immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 inhibitor.

In June 2021, that number was 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Christopher Whaley, a health economist at Brown University, to help clarify how we should view the effectiveness of the shots and the estimated number of lives they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s really hard to think that President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is anything but that largest public health success in history,” Whaley said. “I think we sometimes lose appreciation for how important and how impactful getting access to vaccines was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whaley has published two studies on the number of lives saved by the COVID vaccines; one of them looked at the impact that the vaccine rollout in December 2020 had on the rate of deaths being recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the United States, we found that COVID vaccines averted nearly 140,000 deaths than would have otherwise happened [over the six months studied] if vaccines were not rolled out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Calculating &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00220-5/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excess mortality figures;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;excess mortality figures&lt;/a&gt;, or the increase in the number of deaths over a given time period versus a comparable period, Whaley then included factors such as the age of a state’s population and how individual states went about distributing the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Alaska, for example, was the first state to reach 20 COVID vaccine doses per 100 adults,’ he said. “Alabama was almost a month later to reach that same threshold in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While studies like Whaley’s are estimates, and figures can vary depending on the data set used by researchers, he stressed that the basic approach is scientifically sound and used to calculate outcomes for a variety of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s not just COVID vaccines or vaccines in general that we use these types of approaches. As researchers we use them across the board in many aspects of health care,” he said. “The same approach is used to look at what are the health effects of Medicaid expansion and getting access to Medicaid coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By Whaley’s calculation, COVID vaccines saved 2.4 million lives in 141 countries, when the threat of death from the virus was at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know that prior to vaccines, COVID was rampant and was leading to many, many deaths,” he said. “Without vaccines, it’s hard to think about a world in which there would have been such an immediate improvement in health and reductions in mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQdGxRd2RtLVBoU1R6elBrZExiZHlzQ2VHN19xUHAyZnVzMGhySGhNdUItczZNV2pTd3lZUzN5OFNJM0hVbTVHS1ZoLTZNV1hfZ0g3a3dpR1dlcnZwNUxOZjRta1VPY2ZMemNjeHFRcXN1dFNTTVFuMnprbFYzaWdRaFRlSGxMRkE0c0IwTnBSRmRhWjJLc01iN3hoSXlUQkhRc2J2eHlGVEQ4TzRZdU5acVZYSQ</guid></item><item><title>I tried this 2,000-step walking workout and I felt so energized afterwards - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE96bWlEcXVuVWM1dW5kenJwRnVBc3RKZGRBM1BMOFpOZGJJRjVGQ1JSY19HT3o5aVlYbDdNdmk4Z3RMNGlLYTQ3LWlXU3kwa2loOUc1N3hEazNmR3dqRWpQNGFuWkl2aHNRSlJGd0ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Walking is one of the most accessible, low-impact ways to get more active and improve your fitness. This underrated form of exercise can boost stamina, burn calories and improve heart health. Even a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/this-trainers-10-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-reach-your-step-goal-and-boost-your-mobility" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/this-trainers-10-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-reach-your-step-goal-and-boost-your-mobility"&gt;10-minute walking workout&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of benefits and counts towards your 150 minutes of weekly aerobic exercise, as recommended by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of online routines to help you increase your daily steps, but if you’re really short on time then this quick session by certified personal trainer Krya Pro is a fun way to get 2,000 steps closer to your step goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I love about this video is that it is low-impact but still gets the blood pumping. It features some challenging choreography too which keeps the mind alert, while developing coordination and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I discovered after giving it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-this-2-000-step-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do this 2,000-step workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need any equipment for this steps workout—just a bit of room to move around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

Even though this is only a short 10-minute workout, I found it easier to concentrate when I went back to my desk and things that I’d been putting off on my to-do list felt more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF) is released when walking and this stimulates the growth of new brain cells, which &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-boosted-my-immune-system-3"&gt;It boosted my immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that walking at a brisk pace can boost the number of white blood cells (the body’s natural defense against infection). So if you are looking for a way to improve your immunity, this indoor workout is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I credit regular exercise for keeping me healthy, and it’s rare that I succumb to a cold, or if I do it’s not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-was-the-active-recovery-session-i-needed-3"&gt;It was the active recovery session I needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After moving from using 8kg to 10kg weights in my strength sessions, this workout served as a great bit of active recovery to help ease my achy muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can ease joint pain by producing synovial fluid to lubricate the joints, and I felt like a lot of the post-workout stiffness and soreness had dissipated by the end of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881yx2w003y2cp41t2h77i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/influenza-vaccine-composition-2025-2026-us-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the composition of influenza shots for the upcoming respiratory virus season, but without input from its independent vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00063b6monos4s2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee had been scheduled to meet Thursday to weigh in on the composition of the flu shots, but that session was canceled without explanation in late February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00073b6mj73lth1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, experts from within the FDA, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Defense gathered Thursday to go over surveillance data from the US and around the world about flu viruses that are currently circulating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00083b6mjal37mb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA is recommending that flu vaccines for the 2025-26 season be trivalent, protecting against two strains of influenza A and one of influenza B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca00093b6mcrxmcgyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA anticipates that there will be an adequate and diverse supply of approved trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines” for the upcoming virus season, it said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000a3b6mdsc6i1j5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several ways to make flu vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the most common&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs, a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000b3b6mja09sjj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure manufacturers can deliver the shots to doctors’ offices and pharmacies in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000c3b6mku1p5ew8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000d3b6mnket2kvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system/who-collaboration-center-erl" target="_blank"&gt;a network of&lt;/a&gt; seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and the FDA are members.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000e3b6mt6ly34md@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. WHO’s own &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for 2025-26 generally parallel those of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000f3b6ml2uqttjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet next and publicly discuss the recommendation and make its own endorsement, and then the agency would make its final decision.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zfca000g3b6muwjlnz5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cancellation of the committee meeting had prompted concerns about the timing of and access to flu shots for this fall. “I’m glad that they’ve come out with the influenza recommendation in a timely manner,” Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the independent advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital, said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881zgti000k3b6mu991g95z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 2024-25 flu season – the worst in the US in more than a decade – is believed to have peaked in early February. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-09.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; in early March that there had been at least 40 million illnesses, 520,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths caused by flu this season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm881yyph00003b6m0vt715ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

Now she and her family are in danger again after the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx2401vn5ro" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;TB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We are poor people," she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now I have to go get the medicine myself," she says. "I am struggling a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The people here are quite vulnerable," says Dipa, 21. "I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Reports show thousands of cases of TB in Bangladesh have been cured thanks to USAID support &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control," said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia," says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. "In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least," says Mr Saleh. "It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of refugees at Cox's Bazar will be left with just enough to live and not much more&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Interim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts – but doesn't say how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: "It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Asif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Unable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have run out of soap," says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. "We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rehana Begum says she believes many people will die of hunger because of cuts in aid from countries including the US&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Patients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me," she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Inside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She looked shocked. Then she started to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. "Even now, it is difficult to manage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of "a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is an absolute disaster in the making," says Rana Flowers of Unicef. "Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns. If that escalates to the degree it could, we won't be able to go into the camps to help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:34:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBWNnVLZXF4NUtHMkQ5WUFlc3JnYUJBN0xQU2FUenR0bU9mdFBqUzAtX2lKcHdFYmRYQ1BKcjE2T1hGQjI3cEJFemxGcG5EMWoyVl9IZXRwbEpvd9IBX0FVX3lxTE11R0lwNmp1SElEX1BDQk9KTHZFYXp0RWtTOEhSV2J1WGRudWplVlhYTE1aSElKRDA0M2VVQ0V2Q1VENk1WbmVIeFFKczJCT0dvT3Rhb2p5TEdZR2JMMl84</guid></item><item><title>Kansas health officials confirm first measles case since 2018 - KMBC Kansas City</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPYWpxTmFfZVZWbnR4NldYaFNlQktQcnZuN1FtUzNkQWVqNV9RZkZiRzBnLWtpQ2lzaEtCNU1oemRsS2pMY3Y2SjZvSDctNmViVUxfeGhUUmdLZjVfbmVocVFBQ2VNaTZEaUNYUElRRGthZEt6aU11WGo4S0JnLThPazB5dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

It can result in serious health complications that, while rare, include respiratory failure, encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a rash that look like red spots or blotchy patches, which starts on the face and spreads down the body, arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While measles is often associated with a rash, it takes time for this to&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html" target="_blank"&gt; appear &lt;/a&gt;(usually about three to seven days after symptoms begin). This means the virus can often be mistaken for a cold or the flu. The rash typically lasts about four to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Individuals with measles are considered to be &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles/health-professionals-measles.html" target="_blank"&gt;infectious&lt;/a&gt; from four days before the onset of a rash until four days after its appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Most individuals recover from measles within two or three weeks. It is considered to be a vaccine-preventable disease. The first measles vaccine was licensed in Canada in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The virus is spread by air and through contact with respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth, such as when an infected person breathes, coughs, speaks or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Health Canada says it can persist on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the space.

A second dose is usually given before a child starts school (between ages 4 and 6).

A widespread immunization program for infants was introduced in 1983, when a single dose was given to children at one year of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A second dose was added to the program in 1996, and a large catch-up campaign was launched to give the second shot to all school-aged children, says Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;What should I do if my child is too young to be vaccinated against the measles or has only had one dose?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The answer depends on how widely measles is spreading in your area, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;In Southwestern Ontario, the epicentre of the province’s outbreak, public-health officials have set up special clinics that offer the measles shot to babies between six months and 11 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;They also encourage children who have only had one dose to get a second one as soon as possible, as long as at least four weeks have elapsed since their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Ninh Tran, the Medical Officer of Health for the Southwestern Public Health Unit, said he is recommending children in his region not wait for their second dose because of how quickly measles is spreading in his community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The same advice wouldn’t necessarily apply in parts of Canada with no measles cases, although there is no harm in receiving the two doses closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" class="text-pb-6 hl3 mt-40 mb-24 c-article-body__subheading-v2 c-article-body__subheading-v2--level3 c-article-body__subheading-v2--regular"&gt;What should I do if my child is under the age of 1?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29" data-fusion-component="raw-html-heading-f0fdQcVJBHGTaJ-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Health professionals say some protection is offered to young babies because of an antibody transfer that takes places during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Typically, children receive a dose of the MMR vaccine at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;12 to 15 months of age, but in some instances, such as during an outbreak, health officials may suggest a dose prior to their first birthday.

            Measles cases in the European region surged last year to reach their highest levels since 1997, the World Health Organization and the UN’s children agency, UNICEF, said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Measles is back, and it’s a wake-up call. Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security,” Dr. Hans P. Kluge, WHO’s regional director for Europe, said in a statement.

            The rise comes after a “backsliding in immunization coverage during the pandemic,” the report said. Vaccination rates in numerous countries have yet to return to pre-Covid levels, increasing the risk of further outbreaks, it warned.

The researchers looked at data from more than 86,000 adults and identified four types of exercisers: those who were more active in the morning; those in the evening; midday movers; and those who were continually active all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Dr Michael Leitzmann, who led the research, said: “Our study highlights that not only is physical activity important for reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, but the timing of peak activity throughout the day could play a crucial role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This study is not the only one to point to a particular time of day to exercise, each with its own benefits. “Exercise is the best medicine, whenever you do it,” says Damian Bailey, a professor of physiology and biochemistry and director of the Neurovascular Research Laboratory at the University of South Wales. “However, you can fine-tune the body’s metabolic responses to it depending on what time you exercise and what your health goals are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;For weight loss and concentration, exercise in the morning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Morning movement has several health benefits. “Exercise in the morning is the best for losing belly fat and good for the obese and those with high blood pressure and diabetes,” Bailey says. For example, a study from Skidmore College in New York found that women who exercised in the morning lost about 10 per cent of fat around their middle, compared with 3 per cent if they worked out in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another study in 2023 from Franklin Pierce University and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University studied 5,285 adults, who were divided into groups of morning, midday and evening exercisers. Those who were active between 7am and 9am had the lowest body mass indexes and smaller waists than those who exercised later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-avoid-getting-injured-exercise-2tj7ts5wf" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 10 exercise mistakes we all make and how to avoid them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Similarly, a 2018 study published in the International Journal of Obesity put 2,680 adults on a weekly exercise plan and found those who exercised in the morning made healthier food choices throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“With morning exercise your body starts burning energy earlier in the day,” says Matt Roberts, a personal trainer who has worked with David Cameron and the designer Tom Ford. “There is some evidence that exercising in the morning is best because it raises your metabolism early and lasts for longer in your waking day, producing greater overall energy usage. And as the 2018 study shows, a morning workout puts you in the mindset of choosing healthier food during the day, so you don’t ruin all your hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Weight loss aside, morning movement has also been shown to have cognitive benefits. A 2019 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that morning exercisers displayed better concentration and decision-making skills. “Morning workouts also have the edge because you’re less likely to put off exercising as your day gets busier and your motivation wanes,” Roberts says. “If you do your exercise in the morning, you’re done for the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.11"&gt;&lt;div id="c24b79a7-8aad-4dda-9564-11c0c305d17e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Gentle exercise after a light meal helps to “reset” your metabolism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;If you want to manage your blood sugar and reduce stress, work out at lunchtime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you don’t have time for any exercise during a busy working day, just make sure you take a short walk after your lunch. A 2022 study published in the health journal Sports Medicine found that walking between two to five minutes after eating can help lower blood sugar levels and keep insulin levels steady. If you can’t manage that, the researchers found that even standing for a short time after a meal helps. “The study found that even a short walk around the block or up the stairs after a meal can improve your digestion and blood sugar levels,” says the personal trainer Lee Mullins, founder of Workshop Gymnasium. “If you do it at lunchtime, you’ll also notice you’re less likely to have a post-lunch slump.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bailey agrees: “Gentle exercise after a light meal helps ‘reset’ your metabolism and counters the elevation in glucose, which can cause vascular complications, such as postprandial hyperglycaemia [also known as PPG, it’s a metabolic disorder where blood glucose levels are abnormally high after eating and can contribute to type 2 diabetes and heart disease].” However, keep it light. “Exercise straight after a heavy meal can cause digestive discomfort and decrease your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, so go gentle to optimise the benefits,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/health-guide-getting-fit-fat-science-g88g8wwwg" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to lose 6lb in 8 weeks: the science of getting fit fast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Exercising at lunchtime may also help your sleep. A study published in The Journal of Physiology found that exercising between 1pm and 4pm can shift your body clock forward, which makes you sleepier at bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Finally, a prelunch workout may also reap benefits. A study from Warwick University found that exercising at midday improved calmness by almost 30 per cent, with the study participants saying they felt more able to handle stress in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;If you want to boost your heart health, exercise in the evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise later on, between 4pm and 8pm, is best for high-intensity performance, and Olympic swimming records tend to be broken at 5.12pm exactly,” Bailey says. Research shows that athletes perform best in the afternoon because core body temperature tends to be at its highest between 2pm and 6pm, and exercising during this time leads to a better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So what about the rest of us? “Low to moderate intensity just before you sleep helps you sleep longer and deeper,” Bailey says. “However, high-intensity workouts will keep you awake, but if you enjoy high-intensity workouts then squeezing one in at least two hours before bed will be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study published in the journal Experimental Physiology also found that evening workouts don’t disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The impact of exercising at night varies person to person and it’s really a matter of understanding how you react,” Roberts says. “For many, moderate cardio work about an hour or two before bed allows the body to be more tired and to sleep better. But high-intensity activity may stimulate you more, so it’s worth tracking your responses because there is no need to focus on low-intensity exercises like yoga alone if you enjoy other exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Men in particular may benefit from an evening workout. Dr Paul Arciero, a professor at the Health and Human Physiological Sciences Department at Skidmore College, studied 56 men and women aged between 25 and 55. While his study showed there were benefits to both morning and evening exercise, he said: “For men, evening exercise lowers blood pressure, the risk of heart disease and feelings of fatigue, and burns more fat, compared to morning exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, the overall message is this: there is no bad time to exercise. “Exercise whenever you can to maximise the benefits,” Bailey says. “Busy people have busy schedules, so squeezing in exercise ‘snacks’ as and when throughout the day has been shown to optimise adherence. It’s the steady drip that wears away the stone, if you want to live a longer and healthier life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPTnZ2d0hZZmhBaWgxR0FxSV9BTUpyYkZUbE54OE5rRDhEM0RIZEtMbmZxT2lwUkRibElhaFFGNjBjX242VWVDQlhwdGY5b2JZSzFjbzBjRTFCV2JwLWY3N1czLWdrRG5VS0dza0ZMNl9ZZkZLcWhpbTl6VnVNelVGT3dBeVdmVDhXZlJIc1FIbVNTTUMxWEhDQg</guid></item><item><title>US FDA makes recommendations for influenza vaccines to manufacturers - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxONW0xWG9jQ2dfemVjNkM2NlFwUl8wT0daVU1uV3c4M2FqYy1SMEhISlppX0J5MUJJUU9GbjNDNW9kcG9UUUJGZkJ3VXNGR2o0dzdFbEFGdnRUZE5LTGRxckw5Z0lEVDA2WEM0bFNlMjdNeGpJLWZYMEhESDMyWjltRk83WlVSWEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-body"&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday made recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for the virus strains to be used in influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 flu season in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Traditionally the recommendations have been voted on by an advisory committee, but the agency made the decision on its own this year.

            When Pastor Landon Schott attended a school board meeting for Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy last week, he found the room filled with balloons and T-shirts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00023b5v9kkfw4ag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The celebratory shirts read: #1 school in Texas for least amount of vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00033b5vb3jmdggg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schott, who has more than 48,000 followers on Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG1I-g-xAPx/" target="_blank"&gt;posted a video&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate all the families at the school who have chosen to “embrace freedom of health and they are not allowing government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00043b5vl7p15fnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State Rep. Nate Schatzline also shared the news with his over 17,000 followers on X. &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727" target="_blank"&gt;His video&lt;/a&gt; says that the school is in his district and that his children attend there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Why haven’t we celebrated this sooner?” the Republican asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00063b5vk2s5sz2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Fort Worth-area school has the lowest measles vaccination rate in Texas: Just 14% of incoming kindergartners had measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) coverage last school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00073b5v8cnr4sf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But low vaccination rates across Texas are leaving many communities vulnerable amid a measles outbreak centered in the western part of the state, one of the largest the United States has seen since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00083b5v7264odc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In efforts to prevent even broader spread, public health officials in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma are working around the clock to raise vaccination rates and otherwise help protect vulnerable communities – work that is challenged by the spread of disinformation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00093b5vfhldhhnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They are stressed and stretched beyond belief,” Terri Burke, executive director of the Immunization Partnership, a nonprofit focused on improving vaccination coverage in Texas, said at a briefing Thursday. “The biggest thing I’m hearing is the need for more resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000a3b5vhpowuagh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One public health director in a county that has been hit by the outbreak told Burke she had been working more than a month straight without a day off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000b3b5votggy60c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We spoke at six o’clock at night, and she told me she had started at 4:30 that morning,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000c3b5vnpwbt7yp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners in Texas was 94.3% for the 2023-24 school year, just below the 95% target that federal agencies have set to prevent epidemics. But about half of all school districts in the state have coverage that falls below this threshold, including nearly a quarter that have a vaccination rate of less than 90%. And Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy is one of more than a dozen schools where coverage was less than 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87sjgtc00003b6m6frw4365@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The school did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on its vaccination coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000d3b5vpqfoqwkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tarrant County, home to Mercy Culture Preparatory, has not reported any measles cases this year, but local health officials there and in many parts of the state are preparing for what seems inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000e3b5vu5uriq0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re kind of a more high-risk area, if you will,” Russ Jones, chief epidemiologist with the Tarrant County Public Health Department, said at a county commissioners’ meeting Tuesday, referencing the county’s vaccination rate of 91.5%. “At this level, we’ll have some cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000f3b5vczg83b91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that there are pockets of the county where even larger shares are unvaccinated, including children at Mercy Culture Preparatory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000g3b5vk4js8e92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those would be particularly vulnerable if that network of cases crosses with our unvaccinated population,” he said. “If it doesn’t happen, there won’t be a problem. If it does, then we could have many cases, depending on the population it crosses with.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000h3b5vk2xiin2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To prepare, the county health department is communicating directly with schools and day cares and coordinating with hospitals and other local health care providers. Vaccines are available at community clinics, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000i3b5vuxnuhvhq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a heightened vigilance across our state because of this outbreak,” Burke said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000j3b5vhpquwben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health experts work to curb the spread, there’s concern about the ways anti-vaccine messaging can hinder their efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000k3b5voy45q308@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of misinformation [and] disinformation on social media,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “On social media, you can put some of that info out there without any fact checks, and incorrect information is just as readily available as correct information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000m3b5vy32o20n8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also attributed decreasing vaccination rates to a distrust in government and politicization over vaccinations in general.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000n3b5v1z866mfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are these pockets of communities that are anti-vax, and so you can get a lot of people together that aren’t vaccinated, and that’s the biggest … dangerous situation,” Huang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000p3b5v5ah0hdkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As in Tarrant County, Huang’s department has hosted informational sessions with school nurses, physicians and hospitals to make sure everyone is up to speed on measles. He has sent letters to public and private school officials who are in districts with low vaccination rates and offered to provide vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000q3b5v087c0uq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the state line in New Mexico, which has also seen dozens of measles cases, officials are providing vaccines through free clinics. Jimmy Masters, the Southeast regional director with the New Mexico Department of Public Health, says the driving message is “to be proactive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87svu8h00043b6mj6bjj5ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His region has set up clinics not only in Lea and Eddy counties, where there are current cases, but in neighboring Chaves County. Residents are encouraged to check their vaccination status if they are unsure whether they ever received a dose of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000r3b5vt9fnhcw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New Mexico has administered nearly twice as many MMR vaccines as last year. In the past six weeks, there have been nearly 10,000 doses given, compared with about 5,300 in the same time frame last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000s3b5veirnljiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Primary care physicians can also play a key role in getting ahead of the measles outbreak by addressing questions and concerns directly with patients and families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000t3b5v0elrurqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a number of parents today who have concerns about all the vaccines their children receive. We’d recommend they talk to their primary care physician,” Tarrant County’s Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000u3b5v953d73os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians – both in counties that have reported cases and in those that haven’t – are reaching out to families directly to raise their awareness of the ongoing outbreak and encourage them to get their children vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000v3b5v75b29yd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very important for all of us – and especially on an individual level – to continue to be the voice of truth, if you will, but also the voice of strength and endurance and commitment to our families and our children in Texas,” Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician in Lubbock, said at the briefing Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000w3b5v6rkbjd7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Learning about how many vaccinations had been administered in New Mexico bolstered her determination to continue the work she’s been doing to keep her patients and their families safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000x3b5vli1ai8tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That extra effort is being made, and there is a difference that is coming out from that, although it may be small and tied up in little experiences,” she said. “But it is making a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            When Pastor Landon Schott attended a school board meeting for Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy last week, he found the room filled with balloons and T-shirts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00023b5v9kkfw4ag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The celebratory shirts read: #1 school in Texas for least amount of vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00033b5vb3jmdggg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schott, who has more than 48,000 followers on Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG1I-g-xAPx/" target="_blank"&gt;posted a video&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate all the families at the school who have chosen to “embrace freedom of health and they are not allowing government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00043b5vl7p15fnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State Rep. Nate Schatzline also shared the news with his over 17,000 followers on X. &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727" target="_blank"&gt;His video&lt;/a&gt; says that the school is in his district and that his children attend there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00053b5vhvrbxu81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why haven’t we celebrated this sooner?” the Republican asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00063b5vk2s5sz2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Fort Worth-area school has the lowest measles vaccination rate in Texas: Just 14% of incoming kindergartners had measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) coverage last school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00073b5v8cnr4sf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But low vaccination rates across Texas are leaving many communities vulnerable amid a measles outbreak centered in the western part of the state, one of the largest the United States has seen since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00083b5v7264odc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In efforts to prevent even broader spread, public health officials in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma are working around the clock to raise vaccination rates and otherwise help protect vulnerable communities – work that is challenged by the spread of disinformation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn00093b5vfhldhhnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They are stressed and stretched beyond belief,” Terri Burke, executive director of the Immunization Partnership, a nonprofit focused on improving vaccination coverage in Texas, said at a briefing Thursday. “The biggest thing I’m hearing is the need for more resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000a3b5vhpowuagh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One public health director in a county that has been hit by the outbreak told Burke she had been working more than a month straight without a day off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000b3b5votggy60c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We spoke at six o’clock at night, and she told me she had started at 4:30 that morning,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000c3b5vnpwbt7yp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners in Texas was 94.3% for the 2023-24 school year, just below the 95% target that federal agencies have set to prevent epidemics. But about half of all school districts in the state have coverage that falls below this threshold, including nearly a quarter that have a vaccination rate of less than 90%. And Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy is one of more than a dozen schools where coverage was less than 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87sjgtc00003b6m6frw4365@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The school did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on its vaccination coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000d3b5vpqfoqwkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tarrant County, home to Mercy Culture Preparatory, has not reported any measles cases this year, but local health officials there and in many parts of the state are preparing for what seems inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000e3b5vu5uriq0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re kind of a more high-risk area, if you will,” Russ Jones, chief epidemiologist with the Tarrant County Public Health Department, said at a county commissioners’ meeting Tuesday, referencing the county’s vaccination rate of 91.5%. “At this level, we’ll have some cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000f3b5vczg83b91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that there are pockets of the county where even larger shares are unvaccinated, including children at Mercy Culture Preparatory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000g3b5vk4js8e92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those would be particularly vulnerable if that network of cases crosses with our unvaccinated population,” he said. “If it doesn’t happen, there won’t be a problem. If it does, then we could have many cases, depending on the population it crosses with.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000h3b5vk2xiin2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To prepare, the county health department is communicating directly with schools and day cares and coordinating with hospitals and other local health care providers. Vaccines are available at community clinics, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000i3b5vuxnuhvhq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a heightened vigilance across our state because of this outbreak,” Burke said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000j3b5vhpquwben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health experts work to curb the spread, there’s concern about the ways anti-vaccine messaging can hinder their efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000k3b5voy45q308@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of misinformation [and] disinformation on social media,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “On social media, you can put some of that info out there without any fact checks, and incorrect information is just as readily available as correct information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000m3b5vy32o20n8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also attributed decreasing vaccination rates to a distrust in government and politicization over vaccinations in general.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000n3b5v1z866mfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are these pockets of communities that are anti-vax, and so you can get a lot of people together that aren’t vaccinated, and that’s the biggest … dangerous situation,” Huang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000p3b5v5ah0hdkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As in Tarrant County, Huang’s department has hosted informational sessions with school nurses, physicians and hospitals to make sure everyone is up to speed on measles. He has sent letters to public and private school officials who are in districts with low vaccination rates and offered to provide vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000q3b5v087c0uq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the state line in New Mexico, which has also seen dozens of measles cases, officials are providing vaccines through free clinics. Jimmy Masters, the Southeast regional director with the New Mexico Department of Public Health, says the driving message is “to be proactive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87svu8h00043b6mj6bjj5ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His region has set up clinics not only in Lea and Eddy counties, where there are current cases, but in neighboring Chaves County. Residents are encouraged to check their vaccination status if they are unsure whether they ever received a dose of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000r3b5vt9fnhcw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New Mexico has administered nearly twice as many MMR vaccines as last year. In the past six weeks, there have been nearly 10,000 doses given, compared with about 5,300 in the same time frame last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000s3b5veirnljiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Primary care physicians can also play a key role in getting ahead of the measles outbreak by addressing questions and concerns directly with patients and families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000t3b5v0elrurqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a number of parents today who have concerns about all the vaccines their children receive. We’d recommend they talk to their primary care physician,” Tarrant County’s Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000u3b5v953d73os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians – both in counties that have reported cases and in those that haven’t – are reaching out to families directly to raise their awareness of the ongoing outbreak and encourage them to get their children vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000v3b5v75b29yd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very important for all of us – and especially on an individual level – to continue to be the voice of truth, if you will, but also the voice of strength and endurance and commitment to our families and our children in Texas,” Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician in Lubbock, said at the briefing Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000w3b5v6rkbjd7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Learning about how many vaccinations had been administered in New Mexico bolstered her determination to continue the work she’s been doing to keep her patients and their families safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm87s8xsn000x3b5vli1ai8tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That extra effort is being made, and there is a difference that is coming out from that, although it may be small and tied up in little experiences,” she said. “But it is making a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

As the infection got worse, a specialist was called where they gave the diagnosis that Juwan had herpes simplex virus (HSV), saying that perhaps someone with an active herpes cold sore in their mouth kissed the toddler on or around his eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="post-highlights"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A toddler contracted herpes in his eye due to an infected person's kiss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors diagnosed him with HSV, and a specialist was required for further treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the effective medication, Juwan's eye was beyond saving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;His parents are now pursuing a major surgery to save his sight in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="people-also-ask"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;People Also Ask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks of acquiring herpes by kissing someone who has it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing someone with active herpes lesions or via other oral secretions may transmit HSV-1. Studies show that 9% of adults have these particles in their saliva, even when they are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How likely are you to contract herpes through kissing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herpes can be contracted through kissing if the infected person has oral herpes. It can affect the genitals, mouth, eyes and other skin areas through cuts or burns, without any sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Juwan was at risk of losing his eye entirely after contracting herpes from someone’s kiss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="shareable-post-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="toddler-herpes-virus-67d33b1daf820-png__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/toddler-at-risk-of-losing-eye-after-kiss-herpes-virus/?image_id=toddler-herpes-virus-67d33b1daf820-png__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Horrific!: Toddler At Risk Of Losing His Eye After Being Kissed By Someone With Herpes Virus" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/toddler-at-risk-of-losing-eye-after-kiss-herpes-virus/?media_id=toddler-herpes-virus-67d33b1daf820-png__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/toddler-herpes-virus-67d33b1daf820-png__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/toddler-herpes-virus-67d33b1daf820-png__700.jpg" alt="Toddler with an eye patch, seated, wearing a yellow bib and holding a toy, affected by the herpes virus." title="Toddler with an eye patch, seated, wearing a yellow bib and holding a toy, affected by the herpes virus." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/michelle.d.rand.7/posts/pfbid037SFyciGQfPENC2nZjaCezt5gEsTW4DoWF6XmKuVi37SbDhvEu6Fw2D2BBVSnBdtXl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Michelle Saaiman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michelle told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/03/10/toddler-may-lose-eye-kissed-someone-herpes-virus-22702238/?fbclid=IwY2xjawI_6ZNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbUIKscmnBkziVx3W4KWXLkeASlRA-y-XqgGHAQRcHkKMIPknzDj_Sxa0Q_aem_1cg7OQ__VkCfztOlzhP3yA" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Metro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “The doctor was telling me there’s a fever blister growing in my child’s cornea.

I’ve never in my life heard of a fever blister growing on someone’s cornea.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a challenging procedure to get things under control, lasting weeks on end. Doctors had to contact experts in New York for the appropriate medicine, while Juwan’s parents, Michelle, and Neels, waited anxiously, afraid the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/stranger-drank-coffee-reddit/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;herpes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; would spread to his brain or other eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the medication proved to be effective, the virus was somewhat contained.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; found that women with diabetes following the MIND diet saw several health improvements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MIND diet is a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women who followed the MIND diet for 12 weeks experienced lower cortisol levels, reduced waist circumference and better sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern worldwide, with experts predicting that by 2045, more than 783 million people may be living with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For many people, diabetes doesn’t just mean keeping a close watch on their blood sugar and heart health—it can also mean dealing with other related conditions, like insomnia. In fact, a recent study found that people with type 2 diabetes were four times more likely to face insomnia than those without diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This lack of sleep can make managing diabetes even harder, creating a cycle of poor sleep and stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, what you eat can play a big role in improving sleep and overall mental health. Diets like the Mediterranean and DASH diets have been shown to help with sleep issues and reduce feelings of depression and anxiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These eating patterns focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats like olive oil. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A newer diet, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-recipes-for-beginners-8666682" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH diets, &lt;/a&gt;and includes foods that are especially good for brain health, like berries and leafy greens. Studies suggest that following the MIND diet &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;may improve sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; and support mental well-being in people with type 2 diabetes, but most research on this topic is based on observations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge the research gap surrounding this topic, researchers conducted a study to help understand how the MIND diet might influence body measurements, sleep quality, mood (including depression and anxiety) and levels of certain chemicals in the body among women with type 2 diabetes and insomnia, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was The Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study focused on understanding how different diets could impact sleep quality and overall health in women with type 2 diabetes and insomnia. The research was conducted in Sanandaj, Iran, and included 44 participants between the ages of 30 and 65. These women were selected based on specific criteria, such as having a moderate to severe level of insomnia and being diagnosed as overweight but not as having obesity. Those with certain medical conditions, using specific medications or with lifestyle factors like smoking or significant alcohol consumption were excluded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants were randomly divided into two groups. One group followed a standard low-calorie diet (LCD), while the other followed a modified version of the MIND diet, which is designed to support brain health through specific food choices. Both diets aimed to help with weight loss and were nutritionally balanced, though the MIND diet included additional guidelines tailored to local cultural practices. The MIND diet emphasizes consuming brain health-supporting foods like leafy greens, nuts and berries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the 12-week trial, participants kept detailed records of their food intake, and their adherence to the diets was closely monitored through weekly check-ins and monthly meetings with a dietitian. To track outcomes, researchers measured sleep quality using a questionnaire and also assessed physical health indicators like weight, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; and waist size. Additionally, mental health and stress levels were evaluated, and blood tests were carried out to measure levels of specific proteins and hormones related to brain function and stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After 12 weeks, both groups showed notable improvements in sleep quality, but the group following the MIND diet experienced greater benefits. For example, those in the MIND diet group fell asleep faster, slept longer and reported fewer disturbances during the night compared to the control group. Sleep onset time improved by around 20%, while sleep disturbances reduced significantly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding mental health, both groups saw reductions in depression and anxiety, but the MIND diet group had even greater decreases. Depression scores, for instance, dropped by approximately 25% among those who followed the MIND diet. Stress levels specifically lowered only in the MIND diet group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, weight and BMI lowered similarly among both groups. However, the MIND diet group showed more significant reductions in waist size, waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio, with waist circumference reducing by about 5%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People in the MIND group also had a significant increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (aka BDNF, which is a protein in the brain that helps support the growth and survival of nerve cells)  and a significant decrease in cortisol levels compared to the control group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study had a few key limitations that are important to consider. First, the sample size was relatively small, and the study only lasted for a short period, which may limit how broadly the results can apply. Additionally, the research focused specifically on women, so the findings might not necessarily be relevant to men or other groups. Another limitation was how sleep quality was measured — the study relied on self-reported information instead of more precise tools like polysomnography (PSG) or actigraphy, which are the gold standard methods for assessing sleep. Finally, the dietary information used was self-reported, which could have introduced some biases or inaccuracies in the results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on this data, following the MIND diet with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes may offer certain health benefits, specifically when it comes to sleep support, mental health and other similar factors.  The MIND diet's focus on nutrient-rich, whole foods like leafy greens, nuts and berries offers a sustainable way to support not only physical health but also mental well-being. By incorporating these foods alongside other healthy habits, you may enhance sleep quality, reduce stress and even stabilize mood, all important for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/multidisciplinary-diabetes-management-may-lead-to-28-percent-lower-dementia-risk-8580567" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing diabetes holistically&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes this approach so practical is that it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing commitment. Small shifts in everyday eating patterns can yield meaningful benefits. Instead of focusing on eliminating foods, think about adding more brain-boosting options, like a handful of walnuts as a snack, or swapping a refined side dish for a colorful salad rich in vegetables. Paying attention to portion sizes and using flavorful herbs and spices like turmeric or cinnamon can also make meals healthier and more enjoyable without feeling restrictive.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/leafy-green-packed-recipes-that-arent-salad-8619158" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; to your meals, such as spinach, kale, or Swiss chard. Aim for at least two servings each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy berries as a snack or dessert—blueberries, strawberries and blackberries are excellent options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use nuts and seeds as a topping for salads or oatmeal, or eat a small handful as a snack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-anti-inflammatory-whole-grains-for-diabetes-8694737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Choose whole grains&lt;/a&gt; like quinoa, barley or whole wheat bread. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Opt for olive oil&lt;/a&gt; rather than butter or other less-healthy fats when cooking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include fatty fish such as salmon or sardines at least twice a week for omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you adopt the principles of the MIND diet, it is important to continue to take your prescribed medications and follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study sheds light on the potential benefits of the MIND diet for individuals with type 2 diabetes, particularly in the areas of sleep, mental health and weight management. While the research was limited in scope and duration, the findings suggest that incorporating nutrient-dense, brain-health-supporting foods like leafy greens, nuts and berries into a balanced diet may lead to meaningful improvements in overall well-being. These results align with the growing body of evidence that highlights the profound impact of diet on both physical and mental health outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting the MIND diet doesn’t have to mean a complete overhaul of your eating habits. Small, gradual changes, like adding more vegetables to your plate or snacking on nuts and berries, may yield substantial benefits. By integrating the MIND diet alongside existing diabetes management strategies and maintaining regular communication with healthcare providers, you may be able to better manage their condition holistically. Ultimately, focusing on sustainable, healthful eating patterns can promote not only better diabetes care but also a greater quality of life.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 6 in 10 Americans who identify as Republican do not trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide reliable information on H5N1 bird flu, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-bird-flu/?utm_campaign=KFF-Polling-Surveys&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_lvjgur3yGTGOt51Js8YZSQ8Dj2tfZCvH0kOX2ra7gEHip5Fw95N7kn0iNin4Ia1Y9v0RS7okt8NvmPCDHtrN9RUM1qQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=351788104&amp;amp;utm_content=351788104&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new poll&lt;/a&gt; from health care nonprofit KFF.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed 70 cases of the virus in humans since 2022, with &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5136755-bird-flu-nevada-dairy-worker/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/5136755-bird-flu-nevada-dairy-worker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one person dying&lt;/a&gt; from a severe form of the disease in January.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Officials say the virus’s health risk to most people remains low, but public health researchers are concerned about the virus and its mutations  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 6 in 10 adults regardless of political affiliation said they trust the CDC is providing accurate information about the virus, the poll found. Democratic-leaning survey participants and those who identified as independents were more likely to trust the agency’s information, compared with Republicans.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked by the survey how much they trust the CDC to provide reliable information about bird flu, 18 percent of adults who identify as Republican said “not at all” and 39 percent replied “not much.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked the same thing, 9 percent of Democratic-leaning survey respondents said “not at all” and 19 percent said “not much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a combined 27 percent of American adults who identify as independents responded “not at all” or “not much” when asked how much they trust the CDC’s information on bird flu.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that most Americans are unaware of what the official recommendations are for preventing the spread of bird flu.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommends avoiding contact&lt;/a&gt; with sick or dead animals and not consuming raw milk or raw milk products, especially if they come from an animal that had or is suspected of having bird flu. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 4 in 10 adults know that they should avoid close contact with sick animals to minimize their risk of contracting bird flu, and 30 percent know they should not consume raw milk or raw milk products. But half of adults are unsure if these measures are official recommendations from the CDC, according to the poll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nearly 4,000-person survey was conducted Feb. 18-25 online and by telephone.  &lt;/p&gt;

It can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Vaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US declared measles eliminated in 2000, but outbreaks have continued to crop up in recent years as anti-vaccine sentiments have grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Health officials say cases have shown no signs of slowing down in western Texas, where two pregnant women recently reported infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Across the state's border, New Mexico now has more than 30 cases, while new infections have been confirmed in Oklahoma, New York and in Los Angeles this week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In several instances, unvaccinated Americans have spread measles to others after contracting the virus outside of the country, including on Long Island in New York, where a baby caught the virus while traveling with family, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cases are also on the rise in Canada, which has reported 146 infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy has so far offered mixed messages about the outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At first, he suggested the rising cases were "not unusual" for the US, before backtracking and calling the situation "serious".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Then, this week, in an interview with Fox News, Kennedy suggested cod liver oil and other alternative measles treatments had proven "miraculous". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The remarks are resonating with some residents in western Texas, said Ron Cook, a family physician and health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak in Lubbock, where a child died of measles this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There, a handful of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;physicians&lt;/a&gt; are handing out cod liver oil to parents of sick children who are sceptical of measles immunizations, Dr Cook said. One physician told NBC News he was just trying to help families with the alternative treatment "like Bobby Kennedy is trying to do". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Vitamin A - a nutrient found in cod liver oil - is sometimes offered as a part of a treatment for measles, especially if someone is deficient, Dr Cook said. But, he added, it is difficult to monitor the levels of the vitamin in cod liver oil, which could endanger children if they are given too much of the vitamin or other nutrients it contains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What disappoints me the most is that they're not talking about the vaccine," Dr Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said he believed that it was a missed opportunity to engage with vaccine-sceptical communities to help slow the spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy, this week, offered a conditional endorsement of the vaccine, telling Fox News it was "recommended" for the Texas Mennonite community - the origin of the outbreak - while also suggesting some of the children had been harmed by the vaccines, which have been thoroughly studied and found to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This week, the Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit that Kennedy founded, updated and re-promoted a 2021 book in which Kennedy called measles vaccines "risky". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to 'do something,'" he said, adding that benefits of the vaccine had been "exaggerated". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:55:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE85YXhaSkZjOUlvTUpQc0dpdGtRTEtxdVFmaGgtMjRibW5ZdXpEY2NTX3FnVzZBdTNaTTZYd01TZEI4TTluQjEwaVdhS0xxYngybEp0a284Tk5EZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBOdFBiUUV5SFh4OTQzLWptV1E2aDlaVmtSbVgwSVFsSWZIb3JKSlNWM092LXc4QkNOSUUyd0tvemZYdXIxRXRYY2F2bVBEZVh1S0pudDhGQUZpRElRNmNV</guid></item><item><title>The impact of kangaroo mother care on maternal and infant health - Church News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPTjd5RXpNckZNWVZHZWdpTlNLQ1FfNXY0UEktWk9OMWJ5eUZaRkxBZkxIaExmcTlQYmk2U0NjQUw5TU9LOERYb09YWGFDbGNqMENPT09Ha3Ffbkphc3VDUm1xV0RXNTREVkcyV0dqaXhjUVlVUU9tRlEtVEVuZ0xtOXY4TFdnaEJXdG4yclFfQ0c5NFU5ZllCTzNlT3pkWTdNN3BjbXRjZHZtZmZHbEg3MkNPQ2pwMkEySWJtc05YYjlLWmN6TVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Alaina Nickerl, a student at Georgia State University, has always loved babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“As the oldest grandchild, I was always in the hospital when my cousins and younger siblings were born, and I’ve always just wanted to work with babies,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Each time she walked into the hospital, an overwhelming feeling of joy and peace would come over her. This led her to pursue a doctorate degree in occupational therapy, with the goal to work in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where babies stay when they need extra care after birth, especially if they are born prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Nickerl, who is in the Canton Ward in the Marietta Georgia Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, learned about &lt;a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2024/06/19/relief-society-global-initiative-women-children-saviors-relief-covenants/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2024/06/19/relief-society-global-initiative-women-children-saviors-relief-covenants/"&gt;the Relief Society’s global initiative for women and children&lt;/a&gt;. One of its objectives is maternal and newborn care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In her studies, Nickerl had been learning about kangaroo mother care and its benefits for both mothers and newborns. The Relief Society’s global initiative resonated with Nickerel — particularly the aim of reducing maternal and infant mortality and increasing positive maternal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item cn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Alaina Nickerl, a graduate student at Georgia State University, presents research about kangaroo mother care, or skin-to-skin contact, at the Georgia Occupational Therapy Association in Atlanta, Georgia, on Oct. 19, 2024." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thechurchnews.com/resizer/v2/VRF72ISE5FHMLGARF46YHI523M.jpg?auth=7629d29bf9a3da5abf9b24f3db54992f4022bc264ed08f05729077406974dfaa&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.thechurchnews.com/resizer/v2/VRF72ISE5FHMLGARF46YHI523M.jpg?auth=7629d29bf9a3da5abf9b24f3db54992f4022bc264ed08f05729077406974dfaa&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Alaina Nickerl, a graduate student at Georgia State University, presents research about kangaroo mother care, or skin-to-skin contact, at the Georgia Occupational Therapy Association in Atlanta, Georgia, on Oct. 19, 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Provided by Alaina Nickerl &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“As kangaroo mother care or skin-to-skin contact is an intervention that can simultaneously address all of these areas of concern, I have decided to focus my capstone project in my doctoral program on kangaroo mother care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This care is an extremely effective intervention that improves outcomes for both babies and mothers. Babies wearing only a diaper are placed directly on the mother’s skin of her chest, with coverings then placed on top of both. This contact maintains temperature, lowers stress, regulates hormones, increases connection, promotes breastfeeding, improves sleep and many other benefits. But it is not always implemented in NICUs as a standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nickerl explained that approximately 15 million babies are born prematurely every year worldwide, and annually about 1 in 10 babies in the U.S. are born prematurely. Premature birth is the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In her capstone project, Nickerl is focused particularly on Atlanta, Georgia, where she now lives, because Georgia’s preterm birth rate, low birth weight rate and infant mortality rate are all higher than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She hopes to create an educational program so people are more aware of the benefits of kangaroo mother care or skin-to-skin contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For all NICU babies, even very fragile ones, it’s been shown that it helps them,” Nickerl said. “It doesn’t hinder them in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3264" data-height="2448"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item cn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="A mother does kangaroo care or skin-to-skin contact with her baby boy, at a Miami, Florida, hospital." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thechurchnews.com/resizer/v2/GI736WJF35BELCR7IQCCNFVJ6E.jpg?auth=5ebbd717aede6e34c40884b55d34725b485718201a0fea0b68d731a1cd48e400&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=600" srcset="https://www.thechurchnews.com/resizer/v2/GI736WJF35BELCR7IQCCNFVJ6E.jpg?auth=5ebbd717aede6e34c40884b55d34725b485718201a0fea0b68d731a1cd48e400&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1200 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;This photo taken April 20, 2009, shows Associated Press reporter Rasha Madkour, doing kangaroo care with her son, Yousef, at a Miami, Florida, hospital. Experts say the skin-to-skin contact helps premature babies sleep better, breathe better, and regulate their body temperature and heart rate better; all of this allows them to devote more energy to growing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Rasha Madkour, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Babies might be in an incubator connected to several machines with tubes and IVs. But NICU staff can safely transfer the baby to the mother’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The main benefit is bonding, “which can be really important, especially in the NICU, which can be a traumatic situation when a birth doesn’t go the way that you planned, and then all of a sudden your baby is in the NICU and you’re separated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nickerl is working with two NICU occupational therapists and a faculty advisor. Soon she will begin her clinical rotation in the NICU. In the coming months she will be speaking with expectant mothers and NICU staff in the area. Then her project will be implemented next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If women can go in feeling confident about the benefits of kangaroo care, that they want to do it, and how to go about it, then they can kind of advocate for themselves,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While she does not have children yet, she has been grateful for the opportunity to learn more about motherhood through this project. She and her husband serve as Sunday School teachers in their ward for the 11- and 12-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her research has felt very spiritual to her. What she has learned makes sense to her because of what she knows about Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation: “Reading the science about it and really learning our bodies are created to do these things,” Nickerl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And, she said, the gospel of Jesus Christ has taught her to seek to help others around her, which is what this project aims to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;All are invited to take part in the Relief Society’s global initiative by serving in their own spheres.

			&lt;p&gt;After a long, stressful day at work, or when pressed for time, the temptation to have a quick, satisfying snack – like crisps or a chocolate bar – can be strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2022.0214?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that these ultra-processed, high-calorie foods play a significant role in the development of obesity, but the lasting effects these foods have on the brain was not clear – until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, even short-term consumption of highly processed, unhealthy foods can significantly reduce insulin sensitivity in the brains of healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect persists even after returning to a normal diet, as shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01226-9"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted, highlighting the brain's important role in the development of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy fat distribution and ongoing weight gain are linked to the brain's response to insulin. In a healthy person, insulin helps control appetite in the brain. However, in people with obesity, insulin loses its ability to regulate eating habits, leading to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin plays many roles in the body, including helping sugar, or glucose, reach muscle cells to be used for energy after a meal. In the brain, insulin also signals the body to eat less by reducing food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not every brain responds the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not every brain responds equally to insulin. Many people have a weak or absent insulin response in the brain, known as "brain insulin resistance". People with brain insulin resistance experience more food cravings and have more belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat can promote obesity and so contribute significantly to insulin resistance. The more fat cells there are, especially in the belly, the less effective insulin is. Fat releases messenger substances that promote insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the signs of reduced insulin sensitivity in the brain can already be seen way before we speak of obesity, which is defined as a body mass index (BMI) above 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in metres), but has its &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/body-mass-index-why-practitioners-are-relying-on-it-less-when-looking-at-a-patients-health-207963"&gt;limitations&lt;/a&gt;. So it is recommended that excess obesity needs to be confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00316-4/fulltext"&gt;measuring body fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just five days of consuming an extra 1,500 calories consisting of chocolate bars and crisps, the insulin sensitivity in the brains of the study participants drastically dropped. Symptoms that, until now, have mostly been seen in obese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even one week after resuming a normal diet,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="154879" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans showed a persistently low insulin sensitivity in the brain. Although no significant weight gain was seen, the short period was long enough to let liver fat rise significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-154881" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;MRI brain scans showed persistent reduced insulin sensitivity. (Svitlana Hulko/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that obesity is not only a matter of poor diet and insufficient exercise. It also has a lot to do with the adaptation of the brain's insulin response to short-term changes in diet before any weight gain occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is insulin resistance in the brain a permanent issue? In the past, exercising regularly for a specific amount of time has been shown to restore brain insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese people. The assumption can be made that this also could apply to people of normal weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of obese people worldwide has more than &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02750-2/fulltext"&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; in the past two decades. And there is little evidence that this trend will shortly come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the role of the brain has to be taken into account since the mechanisms in the body that lead to obesity are more complex than just a poor diet and lack of exercise.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250939/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a March 13 investigation posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7408a1.htm?s_cid=mm7408a1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM145761&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%2520Week%2520in%2520MMWR%253A%2520Vol.%252074%252C%2520March%252013%252C%25202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM145761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; website, the California Department of Food and Agriculture was notified that most of these cases involved dairy farm workers exposed to infected cows.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first human cases in California were confirmed on October 3, 2024, in two workers from separate farms in the Central Valley region, where infected cows had been detected. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients experienced pink eye, while only one reported having a fever. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, 36 cases have been linked to exposure to dairy cows, with all patients showing mild symptoms such as eye irritation, muscle aches and fever. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hospitalizations or deaths have occurred and all patients have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the farm-related cases, one confirmed case was identified in a child under 18 with no known exposure to infected animals. This child had mild respiratory symptoms. The child's household members tested negative for HPAI A(H5N1), although they had symptoms consistent with other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials have been monitoring over 5,000 workers at affected farms and targeted surveillance has identified these cases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and local health departments have provided guidance on isolation and offered antiviral medication to patients and their household members.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the high number of cases, the CDC found no evidence of human-to-human virus transmission.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEHI researchers have made a huge leap forward in the fight against Parkinson's disease, solving a decades-long mystery that paves the way for the development of new drugs to treat the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;First discovered over 20 years ago, PINK1 is a protein directly linked to Parkinson's disease—the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition in the world. Until now, no one had seen what human PINK1 looks like, how PINK1 attaches to the surface of damaged mitochondria, or how it is switched on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a major breakthrough, researchers at the WEHI Parkinson's Disease Research Center have determined the first ever structure of human PINK1 bound to mitochondria, in findings &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu6445" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "Structure of human PINK1 at a mitochondrial TOM-VDAC array," could help find new treatments for the condition that currently has no cure or drug to stop its progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is insidious, often taking years, sometimes decades, to diagnose. Often associated with tremors, there are close to 40 symptoms, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, speech issues, body temperature regulation and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, over 200,000 people live with Parkinson's and between 10% and 20% have Young Onset Parkinson's Disease—meaning they are diagnosed under the age of fifty. The impact of Parkinson's on the Australian economy and health care systems is estimated to be over $10 billion each year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Breakthrough after decades of research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria produce energy at a cellular level in all living things, and cells that require a lot of energy can contain hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. The PARK6 gene encodes the PINK1 protein, which supports &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+survival/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell survival&lt;/a&gt; by detecting damaged mitochondria and tagging them for removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a healthy person, when mitochondria are damaged, PINK1 gathers on mitochondrial membranes and signals through a small protein called ubiquitin, that the broken mitochondria need to be removed. The PINK1 ubiquitin signal is unique to damaged mitochondria, and when PINK1 is mutated in patients, broken mitochondria accumulate in cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although PINK1 has been linked to Parkinson's, and in particular Young Onset Parkinson's Disease, researchers had been unable to visualize it and did not understand how it attaches to mitochondria and is switched on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author on the study and head of WEHI's Ubiquitin Signaling Division, Professor David Komander, said years of work by his team have unlocked the mystery of what human PINK1 looks like, and how it assembles on mitochondria to be switched on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant milestone for research into Parkinson's. It is incredible to finally see PINK1 and understand how it binds to mitochondria," said Prof Komander, who is a laboratory head in the WEHI Parkinson's Disease Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our structure reveals many new ways to change PINK1, essentially switching it on, which will be life-changing for people with Parkinson's."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Hope for future treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author of the study, WEHI senior researcher Dr. Sylvie Callegari, said PINK1 works in four distinct steps, with the first two steps not being seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, PINK1 senses mitochondrial damage. Then it attaches to damaged mitochondria. Once attached, it tags ubiquitin, which then links to a protein called Parkin so that the damaged mitochondria can be recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've seen human PINK1 docked to the surface of damaged mitochondria and it has uncovered a remarkable array of proteins that act as the docking site. We also saw, for the first time, how mutations present in people with Parkinson's disease affect human PINK1," said Dr. Callegari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of using PINK1 as a target for potential drug therapies has long been touted but not yet achieved because the structure of PINK1 and how it attaches to damaged mitochondria were unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team hope to use the knowledge to find a drug to slow or stop Parkinson's in people with a PINK1 mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The link between PINK1 and Parkinson's&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of Parkinson's is the death of brain cells. Around 50 million cells die and are replaced in the human body every minute. But unlike other cells in the body, when brain cells die, the rate at which they are replaced is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mitochondria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; are damaged, they stop making energy and release toxins into the cell. In a healthy person, the damaged cells are disposed of in a process called mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a person with Parkinson's and a PINK1 mutation, the mitophagy process no longer functions correctly and toxins accumulate in the cell, eventually killing it. Brain cells need a lot of energy and are especially sensitive to this damage.&lt;/p&gt;

On the ambulance ride, though, Minka’s condition took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of her eyes closed entirely, the other rolled back, and her tongue twitched uncontrollably, according to her mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time they reached the hospital, Minka, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-7bbe4b90-0039-11f0-b928-1b9facf74249"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, had stopped breathing, her mother remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her death the family learned the little girl had suffered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447909/Doctors-sound-alarm-children-die-frightening-brain-rotting-condition.html"&gt;severe brain inflammation caused by the flu &lt;/a&gt;that has killed more children than usual this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ten-year-old Minka Aisha Greene of Maryland died from flu-related encephalitis after multiple hospital visits, where doctors initially dismissed her illness as routine flu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Minka's mother said doctors didn't investigate Minka's condition further and urged others to press doctors to conduct more tests, such as an MRI or chest X-ray, to ensure it's not something more serious before sending the child home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is in the midst of a protracted &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-a6a80350-0039-11f0-b928-1b9facf74249" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic that has killed 13,000 people this season, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13354909/boy-dies-flu-infection-sepsis-maryland.html"&gt;including at least&lt;/a&gt; 60 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minka’s story of being dismissed at the emergency department is not unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other grieving parents have described similar experiences, including that of nine-year-old Alex Doom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, the flu causes fever or chills, cough, body and headaches, and fatigue. In some cases, flu may give way to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-d03684c0-0021-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, a potentially fatal condition in which the infection spreads to the lungs and fills it with fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu can also lead to sepsis – when the infection enters the blood – and respiratory failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-d02e6e70-0021-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recently revealed that nine children have died of IAE, or brain inflammation that can cause delirium, seizures, and, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14142023/Boy-dies-just-days-showing-signs-common-flu-symptom.html"&gt;in some cases, death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 13 percent of child flu deaths attributed to IAE this season is slightly above average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex Doom &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.staabfuneralhomes.com/obituaries/Alex-Doom?obId=34258591"&gt;passed away in December&lt;/a&gt;, two days after being sent home from the emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His mother had taken him to urgent care on December 23, where he was diagnosed with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors gave him Tamiflu, the antiviral medication, and sent them on their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family spent Christmas morning in the emergency room at a Sherman, Illinois hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex had a high fever and an elevated heart rate, but he was still allowed to go home and ‘let it pass.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day, he became limp, stopped responding to people, and his eyes rolled back into his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alex Doom, right, shown with his brother, passed away in December, two days after being sent home from the emergency department. He was diagnosed with sepsis after being airlifted to a larger hospital, and died hours later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that same ER, doctors diagnosed him with severe sepsis, and he had to be connected to a breathing machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he lost his pulse, and doctors performed CPR for several minutes until he regained consciousness. But he would not recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After air-lifting him to a hospital in St Louis, where he was on life support, his body deteriorated so much that life-sustaining measures were no longer effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Alex was a wonderful kid who touched the lives of those around him,’ his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you ever met Alex, then you know he had the biggest smile ever! Alex had a heart of gold and was loved by so many.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex’s case echoes that of a Boston police detective, Mark Walsh, 51, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mark-and-family-through-crisis"&gt;who died&lt;/a&gt; last month from sepsis after contracting the flu and suffered trauma to his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he arrived at the hospital with chest pains, doctors said he had endured a ‘cardiac event,’ which does not necessarily mean a heart attack, though the family was not more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was deemed to be in stable condition at the hospital when he began exhibiting signs of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Walsh, 51, [right] died last month from sepsis after the flu and heart trauma. He was initially stable after arriving with chest pains but soon showed signs of sepsis. Mark loved grilling, golf, and his wife and two sons, John Daniel and Connor William [pictured]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nine-year-old Madeline Vernon from North Carolina died after developing a 104.9°F fever after initially being sent home, with doctors chalking her symptoms up to normal flu infection. She was later placed on a ventilator and passed away hours later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mark loved grilling for his friends, sports – especially golf – and his wife and two sons, John Daniel and Connor William.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just a few weeks prior, nine-year-old Madeline Vernon from North Carolina &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14406077/girl-dies-flu-fever-season-intense-decade.html"&gt;died after&lt;/a&gt; developing a 104.9F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had gone to urgent care a few days before, where she was diagnosed with the flu and sent home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later, she was rushed back to urgent care, placed on a ventilator to help her breathe, and transported to Brenner's Children's Hospital in Winston-Salem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She passed away hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I literally feel like my heart has been ripped in half. I literally lost a piece of me,’ her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, and Connecticut had the highest flu activity. The five states with the lowest flu activity as of February 2025 are Alaska, Hawaii, West Virginia, Montana, and Wyoming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madeline hadn’t gotten a flu shot this year; neither had Minka. It’s unclear whether Mark had gotten vaccinated, though with a state flu vaccination rate of 84 percent, most Massachusetts residents are protected from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also unclear whether Alex had been vaccinated before getting sick, but vaccination rates in Illinois are low, with around 28 percent of residents being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, flu vaccine effectiveness varies annually, typically ranging from 40 percent to 60 percent. This year’s is believed to be about 35 percent effective at preventing hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That 35 percent, which may seem low to some, is still high enough for doctors and public health officials to urge the public to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa2RPVVlMNHNoSGdtUlNjUGZYOVdmcUVXQkJWRklyR1RjNDhoZXhCZVFSRV9wMzBYZTROTlJ5aktIcy02a0RhUGxLR3dvRmQ5VVpFYkd2OTZnazRWZjMxM2FWczFOa1VGcWRFTzRaeFlJQnBRbGhOa2s1eXloUGRKYTRMelJsUUFa0gGOAUFVX3lxTFBtdE1EZlBpMlZxVW1IdVRRLTNzVUpORUV6WGgwcU9Eb0NYNS1NSUhQRTlWWF9QcFVsSnQ0TW8wNHFTQ3JVYzFxZkdIYTZEYlNNelVRYXNDWjdtT192LU90N3VjUlZ1Z01YYkRiRTZoaWIzS0s1WjlvQzFrSGxSeE1SS0RMOS1mYTQ3WjRMN2c</guid></item><item><title>Doctors Just Discovered A Dangerous Syndrome Linked To Slushies - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE16RmJRV3FQQnZyUUE5U2tmMXFvY19VbGN2OW5ZbDRVaEotWVc1T013ZWdfSEpXZmNwQTJjZlNPeGo0UENnQ0oxdWdBLTU1MWlqX0ZuZXU1QVQzTWNBLVp3V2w3d29wako0RkJmSnE3RHB5a1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Sipping on a slushie on a hot day is probably a core childhood memory for a lot of us.

The researchers tied the symptoms to a condition called glycerol intoxication syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This is a big deal, according to the study’s authors. “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under 8 years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol,” they wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-glycerol-intoxication-syndrome" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is glycerol intoxication syndrome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Glycerol intoxication syndrome is a condition that can happen after having glycerol, an ingredient that is often found in sugar-free slushies or those that claim to have no added sugar. Glycerol keeps the ice in slushies from completely freezing, giving them that “slush” effect without high levels of sugar, explains &lt;a href="https://phmtox.msu.edu/people/alanjami" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://phmtox.msu.edu/people/alanjami" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jamie Alan" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jamie Alan&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;According to the case review, the affected children experienced a decrease in consciousness, a sudden and severe drop in blood sugar (this is called "hypoglycemia"), and a build-up of acid in the blood, which is called metabolic acidosis. The researchers found that these symptoms came on in children within an hour after drinking slushies that contained glycerol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-hypoglycemia" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is hypoglycemia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is what happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is considered "healthy," per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/low-blood-glucose-hypoglycemia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/low-blood-glucose-hypoglycemia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIDDK). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It can cause a range of symptoms, from feeling shaky and jittery to losing consciousness or even having a seizure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-happened-to-the-children-who-developed-the-syndrome" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to the children who developed the syndrome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Luckily, the kids who experienced glycerol intoxication syndrome ended up being okay.

As a result, kids can get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Alan points out that glycerol was introduced into drinks because people were concerned with the high levels of sugar in our food and drinks so substituted this fake version in. But that excess glycerol seems to have the unintended side effect of sparking hypoglycemia in kids, particularly younger children,  per &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/gina-l-posner" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/gina-l-posner" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gina Posner" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gina Posner&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a pediatrician at MemorialCare Medical Group in Fountain Valley, CA.

"If you're going to give kids a slushie, give them a sugar slushie," she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But she also emphasizes that you should be careful about how much of any kind of slushie you give to a child. "Don't give them a lot," Dr. Posner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;And of course, children with diabetes, metabolic disorders, or a history of hypoglycemia should be especially cautious, Dr. Stetson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But parents don't need to panic if their child has had slushies in the past, Alan says. “This examined 21 cases, which is quite low,” she says. “I am guessing this is relatively rare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In adults, Alan says that slushies are usually okay to consume.

Then came a deadly measles outbreak in neighboring Texas. The number of Louisiana schoolchildren with exemptions to vaccine requirements doubled &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2024/09/06/kindergarten-vaccine-exemption-louisiana-increase" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the Covid pandemic, Dr. Avegno worked with state officials to tame high infection rates and promote vaccines. But after taking office last year, Gov. Jeff Landry began carrying out a promise to remake public health after the state’s Covid response, which he thought was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Landry, a Republican, created a position for a state surgeon general, appointing Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former congressman who had &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/louisiana-surgeon-general-blasts-states-past-covid-response/article_64153d82-7c40-11ef-8ed4-07b880ad2d8d.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;railed against the state’s “tyrannical” Covid response&lt;/a&gt; and argued that the real risk was not the virus itself but the vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So it was not entirely a surprise when Dr. Abraham announced last month that Louisiana would “no longer promote mass vaccination,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;calling efforts to do so during Covid&lt;/a&gt; “an offense against personal autonomy that would take years to overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To Dr. Avegno, it was a blunt reminder of how the political aftereffects of the pandemic have left her field worse prepared in many ways to fight the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’re in a very different world right now,” she said. “We are now prepared to throw the baby out with the bath water and leave ourselves incredibly vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

waking up in the middle of the night&lt;/a&gt; - maybe at 2am or 3am?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do you find yourself doing this every night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some may believe this has something to do with the 'witching hour,' &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mattressnextday.co.uk/mattresses"&gt;MattressNextDay&lt;/a&gt; sleep expert Martin Seeley explains that it has a lot more to do with your diet and stress levels than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains that stress and anxiety are most likely the culprits behind your body waking you up in the middle of the night often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if you might believe that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14083591/suprising-subtle-signs-high-functioning-anxiety-symptoms.html"&gt;you're not a very anxious person&lt;/a&gt;, your body may be telling a different story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your brain processes emotions while you sleep, so if you're carrying any stress, even subconsciously, your body might jolt you awake as it tries to deal with it' Seeley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And like many other things, your diet is probably also playing a huge part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeley explains that blood sugar dips may be the reason you're randomly waking up in the middle of your sleep.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep expert Martin Seeley suggests swapping out sugary late night snacks for healthier proteins and fats (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'If you're eating a lot of refined carbs or sugary foods before bed, your blood sugar can spike and then crash in the middle of the night, waking you up,' he says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid this, try cutting out whatever sugary snacks you might be consuming before bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, Seeley suggests something that's a small serving of protein with healthy fats - like a handful of nuts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These can help keep your blood sugar stable through the night,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you're someone who indulges in alcohol or can't get through the day without your cup of coffee, Seeley has some bad news for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Alcohol can also be a sneaky culprit, as while a glass of wine might help you doze off, it disrupts your sleep cycle and often leads to you waking up in the middle of the night,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as for coffee, it may be a good idea to reduce your caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeley explains that even those who aren't sensitive to caffeine can feel the effects of it lingering in their system for hours, which can eventually affect their ability to sleep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seeley says if you can't fall asleep after waking up, sometimes getting out of bed and making yourself tired can help (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if nothing else is working, you can try tweaking your bedtime routine to make sure you're destressing as much as possible before bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeley suggests winding down with an activity that's relaxing for you, like 'reading a book, stretching, or practicing deep breathing exercises.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You also want to make sure that you're keeping as consistent of a sleep schedule as possible - yes, even on the weekends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This, he explains, will regulate your body's internal clock and send a signal to your brain that bedtime is when it's time to settle down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also advises to pay attention to your sleep environment.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;A cool, dark, and quiet bedroom is key, with blackout curtains, white noise machines, and breathable bedding able to make a huge difference,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you do find yourself waking up in the middle of the night without being able to fall back asleep, it's important to remain calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeley suggests avoiding your phone or checking the time, because this can trigger stress and make it harder to fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second you wake up and can't fall back asleep, try deep breathing or meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if that doesn't work, Seeley actually suggests getting out of bed and something something calming (but in a dim light) until you feel yourself getting sleepy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lying there restless will only encourage your brain to associate your bed with somewhere it doesn't get rest, so hop out of bed and get back in when you feel ready to sleep again,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They also suggested that a poorly preserved fetus, around 28 weeks in gestational age, could be seen on the scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440321001746" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440321001746" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;second study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the research team proposed that the reason no fetal bones could be clearly identified was that the mother's uterus lacked oxygen and had become acidic over time, essentially &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/mummy-fetus-pickled-like-egg" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/mummy-fetus-pickled-like-egg"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"pickling" the fetus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, the team suggested that they had found evidence of potentially fatal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/pregnant-mummy-cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/pregnant-mummy-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nasopharyngeal cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the mummy's skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These interpretations were controversial, however.

Instead, Saleem was convinced the mysterious structures in the mummy's abdomen were embalming packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To settle the debate, a team of 14 researchers with varied expertise led by archaeologist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qmJf2vkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=pl" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qmJf2vkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=pl" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kamila Braulińska&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Warsaw studied the Mysterious Lady and published their findings in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1301608039597927369&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12520-024-02145-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Farchaeology%2Fancient-egyptians%2Fpregnant-ancient-egyptian-mummy-with-cancer-actually-wasnt-pregnant-and-didnt-have-cancer-new-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-024-02145-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12520-024-02145-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Farchaeology%2Fancient-egyptians%2Fpregnant-ancient-egyptian-mummy-with-cancer-actually-wasnt-pregnant-and-didnt-have-cancer-new-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ueB8aeTCvtCZrLkAdS4KxE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ueB8aeTCvtCZrLkAdS4KxE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-teenager-died-while-giving-birth-to-twins-mummy-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-teenager-died-while-giving-birth-to-twins-mummy-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient Egyptian teenager died while giving birth to twins, mummy reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;CT scan of the "Mysterious Lady" showing four distinct "bundles" in the pelvis that are not a fetus and are most likely related to the embalming process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Ł. Kownacki)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was "pickled" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/mummification.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/mummification.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embalming process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that "this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the public's intense interest in the "case of the pregnant mummy" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-children-were-plagued-with-blood-disorders-mummies-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-children-were-plagued-with-blood-disorders-mummies-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric health in ancient Egypt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries"&gt;Mummy quiz&lt;/a&gt;: Can you unwrap these ancient Egyptian mysteries?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons with occupational exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus–infected dairy cattle are at increased risk for infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During September 30–December 24, 2024, a total of 38 persons received a positive test result for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in California; 37 were dairy farm workers with occupational exposure to sick cows. One, a person aged &amp;lt;18 years with an undetermined exposure, was the first pediatric patient detected with influenza A(H5) infection in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies should investigate influenza-like illness or conjunctivitis in workers with occupational exposure to animals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. Thorough investigations of all human HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections are necessary to identify potential exposure sources, including monitoring the virus for concerning genetic changes that indicate the potential for person-to-person transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons who work closely with dairy cows, poultry, or other animals with suspected or confirmed infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses are at increased risk for infection. In September 2024, the California Department of Public Health was notified of the first human case of HPAI A(H5N1) in California through monitoring of workers on farms with infected cows. During September 30–December 24, 2024, a total of 38 persons received positive test results for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in California; 37 were dairy farm workers with occupational exposure to sick cows, and one was a child aged &amp;lt;18 years with an undetermined exposure, the first pediatric HPAI A(H5N1) case reported in the United States. All patients had mild illness. The identification of cases associated with occupational exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) viruses on dairy farms highlights the continued risk for persons who work with infected animals. The pediatric case was identified through routine surveillance. Given recent increases in the prevalence of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses among some animal populations, public health agencies should continue to investigate cases of HPAI A(H5N1) in humans as part of control measures, pandemic preparedness, to identify concerning genetic changes, and to prevent and detect potential human-to-human transmission of the virus. To date, no human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been identified in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel influenza A virus infection, including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus, is a reportable condition in California and nationally reportable to CDC.* In 2024, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), local health departments (LHDs), and farms known to be affected by HPAI A(H5N1) (i.e., dairy or poultry farms with nonnegative [positive or inconclusive] A(H5) test results for cows, bulk milk, or poultry) coordinated to reduce infection risk and monitor HPAI A(H5N1) symptoms&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; among workers. All farm owners or managers of affected farms were advised to conduct daily monitoring of workers and report symptoms consistent with HPAI A(H5N1) infection in workers who were in contact with affected animals to their LHD. When farm owners did not volunteer to do the monitoring, the LHD offered to perform monitoring of symptoms directly with workers through phone calls or text messaging. Symptomatic workers were referred for specimen collection, typically, conjunctival, nasal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal swabbing, based on symptom presentation. Targeted surveillance, which includes influenza typing and subtyping for A(H5), was performed at either a local or the state public health laboratory (PHL) for all symptomatic workers or persons with epidemiologic linkage (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;) to HPAI A(H5N1) reported to public health officials. PHLs use the CDC Human Influenza A Subtyping Kit which detects and differentiates hemagglutinin (H) proteins as part of routine influenza surveillance. Selected local PHLs employ the CDC Influenza A(H5) Subtyping Kit to detect A(H5)&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; Asian lineage viruses for suspected HPAI A(H5N1) cases. Presumptive positive or inconclusive A(H5) specimens were sent to CDC for confirmatory testing. This report summarizes information on human HPAI A(H5N1) cases identified in California during September 30–December 24, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Initial Public Health Notification and Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 30, 2024, CDFA detected, and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories subsequently confirmed, HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections in cows from three dairy farms in the Central Valley region of California. In September 2024, CDPH was notified of the first human case of HPAI A(H5N1) in California through monitoring of workers on farms with infected cows. On October 3, 2024, the first two human HPAI A(H5N1) cases in California were confirmed in workers on two separate farms where infected cows were detected in September. These patients had been identified and reported by their employers to their LHD; both had conjunctivitis, and one also had a fever. Specimens from both patients tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus at a local PHL and were confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) at CDC. LHD staff members provided guidance on isolation and offered the antiviral oseltamivir to patients and their household members. No known epidemiologic links existed between the two patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of December 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported 675&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; dairy herds with infected cows, 92 commercial flocks with infected poultry,** and 35 backyard flocks with infected poultry in California. During August 30–December 24, a total of 5,126 workers were monitored at affected farms; 170 persons from 19 local health jurisdictions received testing for influenza A(H5) through targeted surveillance. One additional patient was reported through routine surveillance and subsequently received testing at a PHL. Of the 171 persons who received testing, CDPH identified 36 confirmed cases and one probable (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;) case of HPAI A(H5N1) among adult dairy farm workers and one confirmed case in a child aged &amp;lt;18 years without dairy cow or poultry exposure; 37 persons received positive test results confirmed at CDC. This activity was reviewed by CDC and CDPH, deemed research not involving human subjects, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Description of Human HPAI A(H5) Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human cases with exposure to dairy cows (37).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Persons with HPAI A(H5N1) infection (36 confirmed and one probable) worked at 29 unique dairy farms (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). The median interval from first A(H5) virus detection in cows to the first human case on a particular farm was 7 days (range = −7 to 20 days). Worker monitoring was initiated on one unaffected farm because A(H5) virus had been detected in cows on other dairy farms owned by the same person. All patients with occupational exposure to dairy cows were aged 18–64 years (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). Six patients reported underlying medical conditions. A majority (76%) worked as milkers or cared for sick cows. A majority of patients (78%) reported using personal protective equipment (PPE) at work; 25 (68%) wore gloves, 20 (54%) used eye protection (13 reported wearing goggles), 12 (32%) reported wearing boots, and six (16%) wore gowns. No patients specifically reported wearing a respirator (e.g., an N95 mask) as recommended&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt;; however, 12 (32%) reported wearing other face coverings or face masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients received testing a median of 2 days (range = 0–5 days) after symptom onset. All patients had mild illness. Frequently reported signs and symptoms included eye irritation or redness (97%), muscle aches (34%), and fever (29%). Respiratory symptoms, including sore throat (16%) and shortness of breath (11%) were less commonly reported. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred, and all patients recovered. All 37 patients were offered oseltamivir; two declined (5%). No cases were identified in household contacts of patients with occupational exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Undetermined exposure source (one).&lt;/b&gt; One confirmed case was detected through routine influenza surveillance in a previously healthy child who had no known contact with infected animals or humans and had not consumed unpasteurized dairy products. This patient, who had mild respiratory symptoms and otitis media but no conjunctivitis, was not hospitalized. Oseltamivir was prescribed when positive test results were received for influenza A virus. Subtyping was positive for influenza A(H5) virus.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; The patient’s three household members also had respiratory symptoms; one developed symptoms a day before the patient, while the two other members developed symptoms concurrently. Four days after the patient’s initial testing, respiratory specimens were collected from all household members. All specimens tested negative for influenza A(H5) virus. Specimens from the patient and two household members tested positive for adenovirus and rhinovirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laboratory results (38). &lt;/b&gt;Thirty-five (95%; 37) patients received a positive conjunctival swab result, eight (28%; 29) patients received positive test results for combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, five (14%; 37) patients received positive nasopharyngeal swab test results, two (33%; 6) patients received positive nasal swab results, and one (25%; 4) patient received a positive oropharyngeal swab result (Table 2). The majority of patients had either a positive conjunctival or combined nasal/oropharyngeal swab (97%). One patient only received a positive nasal swab result with no other positive sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Genetic Sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic sequencing of the viruses was performed from clinical specimens of 30 patients; all were identified as HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. All eight gene segments of the viruses were recovered from 16 patients, and partial gene segments were recovered from the other 14. The viruses from the 16 patients with all gene segments sequenced (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;) were identified as HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. The pediatric patient (A/California/192/2024) only had five of eight segments sequenced, which was insufficient to classify a specific genotype; however, the neuraminidase and nucleoprotein sequences shared close genetic identity to recent California HPAI A(H5N1) B3.13 genotype viruses from humans, dairy cattle, and poultry. One virus (A/California/150/2024) contained a nucleotide substitution within the polymerase acidic gene (I38M), which is associated with reduced susceptibility to the antiviral baloxavir marboxil.*** No substitutions associated with reduced oseltamivir susceptibility or adaptations for efficient human-to-human transmission were detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report describes investigations that led to identification of 38 persons who received positive test results for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in California; 37 were dairy farm workers with occupational exposure to sick cows, and one was a child aged &amp;lt;18 years with an undetermined exposure. Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics were similar to those in other U.S. human cases (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;). In genetic sequencing of 30 of the 38 infected patients, all were identified as HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. A substitution associated with reduced baloxavir susceptibility was identified in one virus sequenced from a human case in California. No additional concerning substitutions were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of 37 cases with occupational exposure across 29 dairy farms highlights the ongoing risk for cow-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses among persons who have close contact with infected cows and their raw milk (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). The absence of cases among household contacts is consistent with the absence of viral genetic markers for efficient human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a majority of patients reported using PPE at work, use of recommended PPE (i.e., N95 respirators versus face mask) has been previously reported as being low among dairy farm workers with HPAI infection (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). Additional education and messaging about the risks of working with infected cows and ensuring worker access to PPE might increase PPE use, particularly if done in collaboration with farm worker organizations and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report describes the first detection of a pediatric case of influenza HPAI A(H5N1) in the United States. The source of this child’s infection remains undetermined. Unlike pediatric patients with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections in other countries who had severe illness (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;), this child had only mild respiratory symptoms and recovered quickly. Other sporadic cases of influenza HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred in persons with no known exposure to potentially infected animals (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). To date, human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses has not been identified in the United States.&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, information about the type of and proportion of time that PPE was worn was unavailable for all patients. Second, access to PPE was not assessed. Finally, some symptomatic persons with exposure to sick animals might not have been reported, in which case some human HPAI A(H5N1) infections might have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies should work with dairy and poultry farms to reduce worker exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) viruses and detect and respond to human cases. Prevention, detection, and response strategies include PPE use guidance, training, and distribution; collaboration with farm managers on worker monitoring; working with LHDs to coordinate worker testing; specimen collection and laboratory testing to distinguish influenza A(H5) from seasonal influenza viruses; and distribution of oseltamivir treatment to HPAI A(H5N1) patients and oseltamivir prophylaxis to close contacts.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt; Collaboration among public health, agriculture, animal health, occupational health, environmental health, health care providers, and other state and federal agencies is important for a coordinated One Health&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; response and to enable early detection of changes in influenza A(H5) viruses that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. Ongoing monitoring for genetic changes is necessary to assess the likelihood of antiviral resistance or human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanded subtyping**** of influenza viruses might record additional cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection with no known exposure (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). Health departments should evaluate potential exposures for all HPAI A(H5N1) cases to ascertain the possibility for human-to-human transmission. Surveillance for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses could include expanded subtyping for A(H5) testing in persons who meet epidemiologic and either clinical or public health criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

With about two hours left in the 13-hour flight, the 33-year-old got up for the first time to use the bathroom when she suffered a life-threatening medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was waiting for the bathroom and I got this really deep dull aching pain in my chest out of nowhere,” she recalled in a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alwayssingingmom/video/7476535730894867719" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; video. “I coughed three times and that was the last thing I remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily said she collapsed and hit her head, causing a black eye and bruised arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was unconscious for five minutes,” she said. “I had a near-death experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-30-dies-after-blood-clot-symptoms-were-dismissed-8606693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woman, 30, Dies After Blood Clot Symptoms Were Dismissed Twice as 'Long COVID and Anxiety';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woman, 30, Dies After Blood Clot Symptoms Were Dismissed Twice as 'Long COVID and Anxiety'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank God there was a doctor on board and some very amazing, competent flight attendants who essentially saved my life,” she continued. “They gave me an oxygen tank, carried me to business class, laid me down. I was vomiting profusely, sweating.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of two said she suffered a “massive bilateral saddle pulmonary embolism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Emily Jansson&lt;/p&gt; Emily Jansson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when "a large blood clot gets stuck where the main pulmonary artery branches off into a Y-shape to go into each lung," according to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/saddle-pulmonary-embolism#definition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. Saddle pulmonary embolisms only comprise two to five percent of all PE cases. The symptoms of the condition include chest pain, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saddle PE requires immediate medical intervention. If left untreated, it can result in heart failure and sudden death. The condition is associated with a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3718593/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significant mortality rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;significant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; as high as 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Emily Jansson&lt;/p&gt; Emily Jansson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the flight landed a couple hours later, Emily was taken to the airport clinic for three hours and then transported to Rashid Hospital in Dubai where scans and blood tests were done to diagnose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to how long it took Emily to get to the hospital, doctors told her that “it was essentially a miracle that I'm still alive.” She was hospitalized for six days undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/lauren-boebert-undergoes-surgery-for-blood-clot-in-her-leg-8624015" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Boebert Undergoes Surgery for Blood Clot in Her Leg: ‘Looking Forward to Making a Full Recovery’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Boebert Undergoes Surgery for Blood Clot in Her Leg: ‘Looking Forward to Making a Full Recovery’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily later learned that a number of factors were “detrimental” to her health during the flight. She said doctors attributed her PE to her not moving during the lengthy flight and wearing compression stockings that cut off blood flow. Taking estrogen birth control could have also contributed, she said, because it can lead to an increased risk of blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, that’s how I almost died,” she said in the clip. “I’m speaking out about it to be transparent and also hopefully educate people about the risks of blood clots and just as a reminder that life is so precious and to just really appreciate it. It sounds so cliché but I just have this new outlook on life now. Take care of yourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Emily Jansson&lt;/p&gt; Emily Jansson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily also shared a photo and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alwayssingingmom/video/7470519457249561874" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital, showing off her significant black eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m now officially a pulmonary embolism awareness girlie 💜” she wrote in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

                    &lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is increasing 2% to 4% annually in people ages 20 to 49. And it is expected to become the leading cause of cancer death in this age group by the year 2030. Researchers have observed a significant increase in colorectal cancer cases, particularly in those younger than 35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming trend has prompted numerous studies and reports from leading health organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), highlighting the need for early detection and preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7886195/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of colorectal cancer. Experts say that some of the reasons for the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) in younger demographics include lifestyle patterns, says &lt;a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/rise-of-early-onset-colon-cancer-how-to-prevent-it-achieve-maintain-vitamin-d-sufficiency?srsltid=AfmBOorvY4ZlR_prP6Q-41Nar51Vz3xSav280sl9KzRoJoeD7dIdmIjF"&gt;MindBodyGreen&lt;/a&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Increased consumption of standard American diet foods such as sugary beverages and red and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Obesity in adolescence and adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Metabolic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency also increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 31%. Experts say that to maintain the optimum vitamin D levels in the body you need a daily intake of 5,000 IU of vitamin D3. Since it’s difficult to obtain that level of vitamin D from sunshine and foods alone, supplements may be recommended by your healthcare practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7886195/"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; several strategies to help prevent colorectal cancer, primarily focusing on lifestyle modifications and early screening. To mitigate your risk, consider the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Adopt a healthy diet.  Emphasize a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce the consumption of red and processed meats, which have been linked to higher cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Maintain a healthy weight.  Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for colorectal cancer. Aim to stay within a healthy weight range through a balanced diet and regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Exercise regularly.  Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise each week. Regular physical activity helps reduce the risk of several cancers, including colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Limit alcohol and avoid tobacco. Limit alcohol consumption and avoid tobacco use, both of which can increase your cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Get screened. The CDC advises beginning colorectal cancer screenings at age 45, or earlier if you have a family history or other risk factors. Screening methods include colonoscopy, stool tests, and sigmoidoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Boost vitamin D levels. As noted, ensuring adequate vitamin D intake is important. Discuss with your healthcare provider about testing your vitamin D levels and the potential need for supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

All but one of those people were vaccinated, Grace Kelly-McGovern, a Suffolk County health department spokesperson, said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who was exposed was a child too young to be vaccinated and has been quarantined, Kelly-McGovern said. She added that the child who was diagnosed with measles was also too young to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third case of measles reported in New York&lt;/a&gt; this year as outbreaks rage in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we follow this case and closely monitor potential exposures, we strongly encourage all residents to protect their health and the health of our youngest and most vulnerable residents by ensuring they are on time and up to date on their measles vaccines and all recommended and lifesaving immunizations,” Dr. Gregson Pigott, Suffolk County commissioner of health services, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get the first dose of the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella between 12 and 15 months and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6, before starting school. However, only about 81% of children in New York have received their first doses by the age of 2, according to the city and state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two New York City infants under 12 months old contracted the virus &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in unrelated cases, the New York City health department said last month.

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Children should consume limited amounts of plain milk daily while avoiding flavored milk containing added sugars.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Juice intake should be restricted to small amounts of 100% juice, with specific upper limits varying by age group.&lt;/li&gt;

            Are you feeding your children fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and plant-based proteins? Parents often think about what foods are healthiest for their little ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86aykby000v3b6m3d22969v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what about what your kids drink? Four leading national health and nutrition organizations &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend you also consider their beverage&lt;/a&gt; intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm867elqw00003b6mk0r3afip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the latest evidence and provides recommendations for healthy beverage intake in school-age children and adolescents. They include total hydration needs by age, the types of beverages that are recommended, those that should be limited, and those that should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b0q2m00113b6m2ltjjdh8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They help to answer common questions from parents, such as how much milk should kids drink, whether juice or juice drinks are recommended, and if sports drinks are healthy for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86ayoaj000y3b6m8v4ad603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To break down these recommendations, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00133b6me53xgoq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to consider what our kids are drinking?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00143b6mm7u2a0xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;There are several reasons families should care about their kids’ beverage choices, just as they care about their food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00153b6mxr6uv2qr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To start, it’s important that children get most of their calories from nutritious substances rather than so-called empty calories that have little or no nutritional value. Moreover, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00163b6m2974rwvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a healthy diet is key to reducing obesity and its myriad medical consequences such as diabetes and heart disease. Consumption of sugar-packed sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807548" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with developing overweight and obesity. And these beverages also contribute to &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-sugary-drinks-affect-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00173b6mwmvofbyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What kids drink is a key component of their overall diet, so it’s crucial that parents are aware of what products are healthy and recommended — and, equally, what should be avoided. This is not often easy, as some products may be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/fda-delays-final-rule-foods-healthy-label"&gt;marketed as healthy&lt;/a&gt; but are not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00183b6md95aqvjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much fluid should school-age kids drink every day?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00193b6melwb32ol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration needs depends on age. According to &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the expert panel&lt;/a&gt;, kids 5 to 8 years old should be drinking about 40 fluid ounces a day, which is about 5 cups. Those 9 to 13 years old should drink between 54 to 61 ounces, which is about 7 to 7.5 cups. Those 14 to 18 years old should drink between 61 to 88 ounces, or between 7.5 to 11 cups. These are general estimates, because total hydration needs will vary depending on the child’s size, level of physical activity and climate in which they live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001a3b6mrdtqqh80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I assume that water is the top recommended beverage, right?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001b3b6mrbfafds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Plain drinking water is just fine, and in fact is the best beverage for school-aged children. The vast majority of your kids’ hydration needs can be met through water alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001c3b6mr433jlnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about milk and juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001d3b6mc8jkwm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s take these separately. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; plain pasteurized milk — up to 20 fluid ounces a day for 5- to 8-year-olds and up to 24 fluid ounces a day for older children. Note that sweetened-flavored milk (chocolate milk, strawberry milk and so forth) is not recommended due to the high amounts of added sugars per serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001e3b6m94akj13o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The limit is a lot lower for juice. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to this panel&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of 100% juice is OK. And I mean a small amount: less than 4 to 6 ounces per day for 5- to 8-year-olds, less than 6 to 8 ounces for 9- to 13-year-olds, and less than 8 ounces in 14- to 18-year-olds. That means even adolescents should limit their intake of 100% juice to less than 1 cup per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001f3b6mu4fs9ups@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding juice, these are upper limits, not minimum amounts. Your kids don’t need to drink any juice to have a healthy diet. Children should try to meet their daily fruit recruitment by eating whole fruit, not by drinking juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001g3b6m60wp46u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about soy milk and almond milk? And is there a place for juice drinks that aren’t 100% juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001h3b6mey1tvuvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based milk alternatives like soy and almond milk are only recommended when there is a specific medical reason — such as an allergy to milk protein or if the child has to have a specific diet. Parents who choose these beverages should look for unsweetened products that do not have sugar or non-sugar sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001i3b6mueawagj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Juice drinks are in the same category as other sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas. These are not recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001j3b6mco3rndxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are diet drinks OK if they don’t contain sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel also does not recommend beverages that contain artificial chemical, non-sugar sweeteners. They cite lack of evidence on the safety and impact of these substances on the long-term health among children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001l3b6mdok1dniz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How about sports drinks? How can children who participate in after-school and recreational sports keep hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001m3b6mxqzbaa93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports drinks are not recommended for several reasons. First, many contain high amounts of sugar. Second, they are generally unnecessary. Most people can hydrate sufficiently using water, and they can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/sports-drinks-caffeine-children-athletes-wellness/index.html"&gt;replenish lost electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; through food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86bka9q00213b6mvsixn840@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A third issue to watch out for is that some sports drinks are conflated with energy drinks that contain caffeine and other stimulants. These are not substances that children should be consuming. The expert panel is clear that beverages with caffeine and other stimulants are not recommended for children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001o3b6ml55jq7v6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s your takeaway from this guidance on drinks, and how will you apply them to your own kids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001p3b6m9pqrrcvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; My overall takeaway is that plain drinking water is the best form of hydration. It’s ideal to get kids used to drinking water to replenish their fluids rather than to rely on sweetened substances. Pasteurized milk is also a good source of hydration. While 100% juice can be consumed in small amounts, all other drinks, including flavored milk and juice drinks, should not be part of daily consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001q3b6m67wv7r7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is generally what my family does. We emphasize water and milk. Juice is a treat — not something we offer every day. If my kids are at a party and there are juice drinks, we will let them drink those, but we tell them it’s a “special occasion” beverage. We do not offer sodas or sports or energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001r3b6mphcovd0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, I think the expert panel is right to raise awareness of the importance of healthy drinks, which should be considered just as much as healthy food in forming children’s diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            Are you feeding your children fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and plant-based proteins? Parents often think about what foods are healthiest for their little ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86aykby000v3b6m3d22969v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what about what your kids drink? Four leading national health and nutrition organizations &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend you also consider their beverage&lt;/a&gt; intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm867elqw00003b6mk0r3afip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the latest evidence and provides recommendations for healthy beverage intake in school-age children and adolescents. They include total hydration needs by age, the types of beverages that are recommended, those that should be limited, and those that should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b0q2m00113b6m2ltjjdh8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They help to answer common questions from parents, such as how much milk should kids drink, whether juice or juice drinks are recommended, and if sports drinks are healthy for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86ayoaj000y3b6m8v4ad603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To break down these recommendations, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00133b6me53xgoq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to consider what our kids are drinking?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00143b6mm7u2a0xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;There are several reasons families should care about their kids’ beverage choices, just as they care about their food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00153b6mxr6uv2qr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To start, it’s important that children get most of their calories from nutritious substances rather than so-called empty calories that have little or no nutritional value. Moreover, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00163b6m2974rwvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a healthy diet is key to reducing obesity and its myriad medical consequences such as diabetes and heart disease. Consumption of sugar-packed sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807548" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with developing overweight and obesity. And these beverages also contribute to &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-sugary-drinks-affect-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00173b6mwmvofbyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What kids drink is a key component of their overall diet, so it’s crucial that parents are aware of what products are healthy and recommended — and, equally, what should be avoided. This is not often easy, as some products may be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/fda-delays-final-rule-foods-healthy-label"&gt;marketed as healthy&lt;/a&gt; but are not.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much fluid should school-age kids drink every day?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00193b6melwb32ol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration needs depends on age. According to &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the expert panel&lt;/a&gt;, kids 5 to 8 years old should be drinking about 40 fluid ounces a day, which is about 5 cups. Those 9 to 13 years old should drink between 54 to 61 ounces, which is about 7 to 7.5 cups. Those 14 to 18 years old should drink between 61 to 88 ounces, or between 7.5 to 11 cups. These are general estimates, because total hydration needs will vary depending on the child’s size, level of physical activity and climate in which they live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I assume that water is the top recommended beverage, right?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001b3b6mrbfafds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Plain drinking water is just fine, and in fact is the best beverage for school-aged children. The vast majority of your kids’ hydration needs can be met through water alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001c3b6mr433jlnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about milk and juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001d3b6mc8jkwm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s take these separately. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; plain pasteurized milk — up to 20 fluid ounces a day for 5- to 8-year-olds and up to 24 fluid ounces a day for older children. Note that sweetened-flavored milk (chocolate milk, strawberry milk and so forth) is not recommended due to the high amounts of added sugars per serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001e3b6m94akj13o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The limit is a lot lower for juice. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to this panel&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of 100% juice is OK. And I mean a small amount: less than 4 to 6 ounces per day for 5- to 8-year-olds, less than 6 to 8 ounces for 9- to 13-year-olds, and less than 8 ounces in 14- to 18-year-olds. That means even adolescents should limit their intake of 100% juice to less than 1 cup per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001f3b6mu4fs9ups@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding juice, these are upper limits, not minimum amounts. Your kids don’t need to drink any juice to have a healthy diet. Children should try to meet their daily fruit recruitment by eating whole fruit, not by drinking juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001g3b6m60wp46u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about soy milk and almond milk? And is there a place for juice drinks that aren’t 100% juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001h3b6mey1tvuvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based milk alternatives like soy and almond milk are only recommended when there is a specific medical reason — such as an allergy to milk protein or if the child has to have a specific diet. Parents who choose these beverages should look for unsweetened products that do not have sugar or non-sugar sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001i3b6mueawagj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Juice drinks are in the same category as other sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas. These are not recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001j3b6mco3rndxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are diet drinks OK if they don’t contain sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001k3b6mdmrk66c6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel also does not recommend beverages that contain artificial chemical, non-sugar sweeteners. They cite lack of evidence on the safety and impact of these substances on the long-term health among children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001l3b6mdok1dniz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How about sports drinks? How can children who participate in after-school and recreational sports keep hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001m3b6mxqzbaa93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports drinks are not recommended for several reasons. First, many contain high amounts of sugar. Second, they are generally unnecessary. Most people can hydrate sufficiently using water, and they can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/sports-drinks-caffeine-children-athletes-wellness/index.html"&gt;replenish lost electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; through food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86bka9q00213b6mvsixn840@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A third issue to watch out for is that some sports drinks are conflated with energy drinks that contain caffeine and other stimulants. These are not substances that children should be consuming. The expert panel is clear that beverages with caffeine and other stimulants are not recommended for children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001o3b6ml55jq7v6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s your takeaway from this guidance on drinks, and how will you apply them to your own kids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001p3b6m9pqrrcvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; My overall takeaway is that plain drinking water is the best form of hydration. It’s ideal to get kids used to drinking water to replenish their fluids rather than to rely on sweetened substances. Pasteurized milk is also a good source of hydration. While 100% juice can be consumed in small amounts, all other drinks, including flavored milk and juice drinks, should not be part of daily consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001q3b6m67wv7r7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is generally what my family does. We emphasize water and milk. Juice is a treat — not something we offer every day. If my kids are at a party and there are juice drinks, we will let them drink those, but we tell them it’s a “special occasion” beverage. We do not offer sodas or sports or energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001r3b6mphcovd0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, I think the expert panel is right to raise awareness of the importance of healthy drinks, which should be considered just as much as healthy food in forming children’s diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195439" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195439" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/28/2/147/2730195?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/28/2/147/2730195?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjopen/article/3/3/oead057/7194785" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ehjopen/article/3/3/oead057/7194785" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the landmark 1994 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149(94)90439-1/abstract" data-url="https://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149(94)90439-1/abstract" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Journal of Cardiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34655-human-heart.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34655-human-heart.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the heart&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Elite rowers tend to have bigger hearts compared to elite runners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.clinicspots.com/blog/dr.%20bhaskar%20semitha-1" data-url="https://www.clinicspots.com/blog/dr.%20bhaskar%20semitha-1" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Bhaskar Semitha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. "[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-muscles-are-used-for-running" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-muscles-are-used-for-running"&gt;&lt;u&gt;targets your legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat," Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/best-rowing-machines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/best-rowing-machines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;best rowing machines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/best-treadmills" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/best-treadmills"&gt;treadmill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, this leads to a lower &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;resting heart rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also leads to a significant increase in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-VO2-max" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-VO2-max"&gt;&lt;u&gt;VO2 max&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. "That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Elite rowers have some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_3086564085750163887&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00421-002-0599-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fhow-does-rowing-affect-your-heart-and-is-it-different-to-running" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-002-0599-z" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00421-002-0599-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fhow-does-rowing-affect-your-heart-and-is-it-different-to-running" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/sergii-putsov/" data-url="https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/sergii-putsov/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sergii Putsov, PhD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. "Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity," Putsov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Running forces your body to work against gravity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. "[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing," Semitha said. "The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition," Putsov said. "The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running.

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 13 March 2025, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died on 28 January 2025 and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations. No new confirmed cases were reported since then.

The outbreak was declared on 20 January 2025. As of 12 March 2025, two confirmed and eight probable cases were reported by the Ministry of Health from Biharamulo district in Kagera region. All 10 cases died (case fatality ratio 100%), including eight who died before the confirmation of the outbreak. 

A total of 272 contacts that were listed for monitoring completed their 21-day follow-up as of 10 February 2025.

WHO, through its country office, and partners provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. The risk of re-emergence of MVD remains after the official declaration of the end of the outbreak, linked to the animal reservoir’s presence in the country. WHO encourages maintaining early case detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond, and continued risk communication and community engagement.

        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;span&gt;Since the last &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON554" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Disease Outbreak News &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;on this event, published on 14 February 2025, no new confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in the United Republic of Tanzania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 12 March 2025, 10 cases have been reported including two confirmed and eight probable cases. All cases resulted in deaths, including eight who died before the confirmation of the outbreak and were classified as probable cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio of 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first identified case, an adult female, had symptom onset on 9 December and died on 16 December 2024. The last confirmed case died on 28 January, and a safe and dignified burial was performed. No new confirmed or probable cases have been reported following this burial. All 10 cases were reported from Biharamulo district in Kagera region; the median age of cases was 30 years (range: 1 to 75 years) and the majority of cases (70%, 7) were females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, 108 suspected cases were reported between 20 January and 11 March, of which 106 tested negative for MVD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 12 March 2025, 281 contacts had been listed, including nine who were subsequently classified as probable and confirmed cases and 272 contacts who completed 21 days of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 13 March 2025, after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) without a new confirmed case being reported after the last confirmed case died on 28 January 2025, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak, as per WHO recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Map of district reporting confirmed and probable Marburg virus disease cases in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 12 March 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/don-map-mvd-tanzania.png?sfvrsn=44f64167_4" title="DON Map MVD Tanzania" alt="Map for DON MVD in Tanzania" class="-align-center" sf-size="97405"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause severe disease and is clinically similar to Ebola disease (EBOD). EBOD and MVD are caused by orthoebolaviruses and orthomarburgviruses respectively; both are members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People become infected after prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus fruit bat colonies, a type of fruit bat that can carry the Marburg virus.  Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas of the body. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON548" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; outbreak was reported in Rwanda between September and December 2024. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The Ministry of Health developed a national response plan to guide response      activities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;A National      Incident Management System was activated to coordinate the response to the      event; a national task force was activated, and meetings were held weekly.      At the sub-national level, regular coordination meetings were held daily      in Kagera Region. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;A national rapid response team was deployed to Kagera to enhance outbreak      investigation and response, with technical and operational support from      WHO and health partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;WHO deployed experts to support the Ministry of Health with Emergency      management and partner coordination, clinical management, health      logistics, infection prevention and control, and other response activities      in different pillars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Surveillance activities were conducted with active case finding, contact tracing and      mortality surveillance across affected and neighbouring areas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The mobile laboratory      deployed in Kabyaile was utilized to support the testing of suspect cases      for rapid turnaround time, and samples were referred to the National Public      Health Laboratory in Dar es Salaam for additional tests.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Travellers departing from the Kagera Region were screened at key points of entry and      exit, including Bukoba airport. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Health and care worker      sensitization sessions on infection prevention and control were conducted across      Kagera and other regions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The Marburg Treatment Unit was upgraded with enhanced triage, patient wards,      and donning and doffing areas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Public awareness campaigns were conducted, including health education,      door-to-door outreach by community health workers, and public      announcements in high-risk areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Cross-border meetings were convened between Tanzania, Uganda, and      Burundi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;WHO procured and delivered four VHF kits to Kagera region to      support care for patients and infection prevention and control measures.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With two confirmed cases and eight probable cases reported, this is the second MVD outbreak reported in the country in the last three years. Both outbreaks occurred in the same region of Kagera located at the border with Rwanda and Uganda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case fatality ratio of 100% is concerning, although has been recorded in previous outbreaks, additionally 8 of the 10 cases were probable i.e. reported after their death. Late health seeking behaviour in MVD outbreaks increases the risk of further transmission.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the outbreak is still unknown, and research activities are planned. Based on the outbreak investigation and surveillance activities during the response, which included contact tracing, alert management, active case search, and mortality surveillance, no additional cases have been reported during the 42-day countdown period. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD following the declaration of the end of the outbreak, linked to a new spillover from interactions with the animal reservoir. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in Tanzania, the risk is considered as moderate&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at the national level, and low at regional and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO encourages maintaining early detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness of risk factors for Marburg virus infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the      risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines      or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. People visiting or working in      mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies should wear gloves and      other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capabilities for      early detection of MVD patients should be maintained over time in settings      at risk of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the      risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct      or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body      fluids. Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided.      Patients suspected or confirmed for MVD should be isolated in a designated      treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communities affected by MVD, along with health authorities, should ensure that the      population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself      and about necessary outbreak containment measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased,      identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with      MVD and monitoring their health for 21 days, separating the healthy from      the sick to prevent further spread and providing care to the confirmed      patient. Maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment need to be      observed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Critical infection prevention and control      measures should be implemented and/or strengthened in all health care      facilities, per &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s Infection prevention and control      guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Health workers caring for patients with      confirmed or suspected MVD should apply &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.2" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;transmission-based precautions&lt;/a&gt; in addition to: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standard precautions&lt;/a&gt;, including appropriate use of PPE and hand      hygiene according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO 5 moments&lt;/a&gt; to avoid contact with patient’s blood and      other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Waste      generated in healthcare facilities must be safely segregated, collected,      transported, stored, treated and finally disposed. Follow the national guidelines,      rules and regulations for safe waste disposal or follow the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/85349/9789241548564_eng.pdf;sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s guidelines on safe waste management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patient-care activities should be      undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment that facilitates practices      related to the prevention and control of health-care-associated infections      (HAIs) as outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241547239" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Essential environmental health standards in      health care&lt;/a&gt;. Safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene      infrastructure and services should be provided in healthcare facilities.      For details on recommendations and improvement, follow the &lt;a href="https://openwho.org/courses/wash-fit" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WASH FIT implementation Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WHO encourages countries to implement a      comprehensive care programme to support people who have recovered from MVD      (if any) with any subsequent sequelae and to enable them to access body      fluid testing and to mitigate the risk of transmission through infected      body fluids by adequate practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with the United Republic of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon are the unlikely heroes of an accidental back-of-the-pantry natural history museum, with decades of Alaskan marine ecology preserved in brine and tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-are-actually-vital-for-some-species-survival-study-shows"&gt;tell us a lot&lt;/a&gt; about an ecosystem, because they're usually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-want-you-to-stop-hating-on-parasites-and-they-ve-got-a-12-step-plan-to-help"&gt;up in the business of several species&lt;/a&gt;. But unless they cause some major problem to humans, historically we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-we-don-t-know-about-parasites-could-be-disastrous-for-both-us-and-them"&gt;haven't paid them much attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a problem for parasite ecologists, like Natalie Mastick and Chelsea Wood from the University of Washington, who had been searching for a way to retroactively track the effects parasites had on Pacific Northwestern marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Wood got a call from Seattle's Seafood Products Association, asking if she'd be interested in taking boxes of dusty old expired cans of salmon – dating back to the 1970s – off their hands, her answer was, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cans had been set aside for decades as part of the association's quality control process, but i&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYz3FOsYTU"&gt;n the hands of the ecologists&lt;/a&gt;, they became an archive of excellently preserved specimens; not of salmon, but of worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIYz3FOsYTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the idea of worms in your canned fish is a bit stomach-turning, these roughly 0.4-inch (1-centimeter) long marine parasites, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakidae"&gt;anisakids&lt;/a&gt;, are harmless to humans when killed during the canning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone assumes that worms in your salmon is a sign that things have gone awry," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wood when the research was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the anisakid life cycle integrates many components of the food web. I see their presence as a signal that the fish on your plate came from a healthy ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A red circle around tweezers grabbing a piece of cooked salmon" class="size-full wp-image-123845" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An anisakid worm (circled in red) in a canned salmon fillet. (Natalie Mastick/University of Washington)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anisakids enter the food web when they are eaten by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn are eaten by larger species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how anisakids end up in the salmon, and eventually, the intestines of marine mammals, where the worms complete their life cycle by reproducing. Their eggs are excreted into the ocean by the mammal, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If a host is not present – marine mammals, for example – anisakids can't complete their life cycle and their numbers will drop," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wood, the paper's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 178 tin cans in the 'archive' contained four different salmon species caught in the Gulf of Alaska and Bristol Bay across a 42-year period (1979–2021), including 42 cans of chum &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chum_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus keta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), 22 coho (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;kisutch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 62 pink (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gorbuscha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and 52 sockeye &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus nerka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the techniques used to preserve the salmon do not, thankfully, keep the worms in pristine condition, the researchers were able to dissect the filets and calculate the number of worms per gram of salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A brownish worm magnified on a white background" class="size-full wp-image-123844" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A highly degraded anisakid found in canned salmon. (&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;Natalie Mastick/University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found worms had increased over time in chum and pink salmon, but not in sockeye or coho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seeing their numbers rise over time, as we did with pink and chum salmon, indicates that these parasites were able to find all the right hosts and reproduce," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mastick, the paper's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That could indicate a stable or recovering ecosystem, with enough of the right hosts for anisakids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg" alt="Graph showing number of cans from each year that contained each species" class="size-medium wp-image-145288" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-756x415.jpg 756w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-1536x843.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-2048x1124.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-600x329.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The distribution of canned salmon samples available for each salmon species in each decade. (Mastick et al., &lt;em&gt;Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's harder to explain the stable levels of worms in coho and sockeye, especially since the canning process made it difficult to identify the specific species of anisakid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Though we are confident in our identification to the family level, we could not identify the [anisakids] we detected at the species level," the authors &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So it is possible that parasites of an increasing species tend to infect pink and chum salmon, while parasites of a stable species tend to infect coho and sockeye."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastick and colleagues think this novel approach – dusty old cans turned ecological archive – could fuel many more scientific discoveries. It seems they've opened quite a can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;Ecology and Evolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
