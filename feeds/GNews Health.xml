Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1599?guestAccessKey=3bb97cc4-36f2-4679-807b-4741de2fa139&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary. On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRXEza3pxVmo5REtJWjZ1YWEzYzdUeXA3R1o2OEVpTS10WWR5UHA3YUQxN3hCMlJmOEI0dWFHWElCNHZpZVR1c0YtREctUUlVd3BpNXctcjVkM0V6TVlvX3Y5SngyM3RfOWlFSHQ4b1NfbzZ6NlJDNE1yNUxVNFVqVHgzdmJudDhFU2dyejdZSVhLa2lqcnpTTXVuWkQwYWVlZWhCS2hITG12UkNv</guid></item><item><title>用于新冠疫苗注射， mRNA可能有助于摆脱艾滋病毒的身体-《纽约时报》 | Used in Covid Shots, mRNA May Help Rid the Body of H.I.V. - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFAxMGxGSkdWSEVweFVONnNRVmNjRVhzX1B4UDNRbE5HZ0NhTU1FVEszN280U2JLTWNuWHQzNHlkTkNDb2c3RjlhQjdPR05HZ1I2NE9uRDl3WFgwNW5TZ0xqQ2pNdTBQTkxNWVRGNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The technology that powered Covid vaccines may also lead scientists to a cure for H.I.V. Using mRNA, Australian researchers said they were able to trick the virus to come out of hiding, a crucial step in ridding the body of it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The research, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Communications, is still preliminary, and so far, has been shown to be successful only in a lab. But it suggests that mRNA has potential far beyond its use in vaccines as a means to deliver therapies against stubborn adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is a set of instructions for a gene. In the case of Covid vaccines, the instructions were for a piece of the coronavirus. In the new study, they are for molecules key to targeting H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Sharon Lewin, director of the Cumming Global Center for Pandemic Therapeutics in Melbourne, who led the study, called mRNA a “miraculous” tool “to deliver things that you want into places that were not possible before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Vaccines deploying mRNA instruct the body to produce a fragment of the virus, which then sets off the body’s immune response. In the United States, the shots were initially hailed for turning back the pandemic, then viewed by some with suspicion and fear. Some officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have falsely said that they are highly dangerous and even deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women-rfk-jr.html" title=""&gt;sought to limit the vaccine’s availability&lt;/a&gt; to pregnant women, children and healthy younger adults.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using a combination of live virus testing, protein modeling, and AI simulations, the team mapped out how HKU5 could jump from bats to humans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9676127/China-claims-24-different-new-coronaviruses-bats-amid-lab-leak-suspicions.html"&gt;collected the HKU5-CoV-2 strain from a small subset of hundreds of bats swabbed across southern and eastern regions of China.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently only spreading in bats - but experts &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8501315/Warning-rise-diseases-jumping-animals-humans-like-Covid-19.html"&gt;fear unregulated wildlife trade in China raises risk of spillover events.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their experiments, the researchers used gene-editing tools to create 'pseudoviruses', lab-made virus particles that include the HKU5 spike protein but are harmless and don't replicate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These pseudoviruses were introduced to different types of cells, some carrying bat ACE2 and others carrying human ACE2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus glowed green when it successfully entered and replicated inside a cell. Bat cells lit up brightly, showing HKU5 can easily infect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human cells, however, showed little response unless the virus carried specific mutations that improved its ability to latch onto ACE2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results raise concern that if HKU5 jumps to an intermediate animal, such as mink or civets, it could acquire mutatations before reaching humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FBI and CIA believe COVID-19 most likely &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8738963/Scientists-examine-possibility-Covid-19-leaked-Chines-lab.html"&gt;originated from a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was working with dangerous coronaviruses in the years leading up to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HKU5 was first discovered in 2005 in a species of bat called the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), but only recently did scientists realize it can use ACE2, the same protein that allowed Covid-19 to enter human cells and infect millions worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory points to a wet market, where dozens of animals were kept in squalid conditions, possibly serving as an intermediate host before the virus jumped to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study published in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60286-3.epdf?sharing_token=M_fyPpicsSi90ieoUVpsvdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MpJemnpboKpSy-Zw9PA9tV_-v8PA1nXzDlGTQ0NifJwD3Ei0bkgI1x3xtkoSHh4hV0i3yI2ZtbKyJbSSGmVFpaXlfHtzPEv8M87AIqSmuxYs1fAIGKvHljCW6afDXw5AA%3D"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, focused on a lesser-known group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses, which includes HKU5 and MERS-CoV, the virus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS spreads from camels to humans and has a fatality rate of about 34 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To visualize the virus's structure, scientists used cryo-electron microscopy, a high-resolution imaging method that allowed them to examine the spike protein in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that key parts of the spike remained in a 'closed' position, which makes infection more difficult, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans,' Letko said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there and that makes them worth watching.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, scientists in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;You might want to hold off on stockpiling taurine supplements as part of your anti-aging cocktail. Research published today failed to find evidence that our levels of taurine shrink as we get older, contrary to some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health led the research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl2116"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. They analyzed long-running data from past human, mice, and monkey studies, finding that taurine levels didn’t change much over time and widely varied between individual animals. The results suggest that taurine isn’t a good marker for age and throw into doubt the idea that it can prolong healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="timeline" data-v-234a609b=""&gt; &lt;p class="text" data-v-234a609b=""&gt;“Circulating taurine doesn’t decline with age in healthy individuals of these three mammalian species across the adult lifespan,” said lead study researcher Maria Emilia Fernandez, a postdoctoral fellow in the Translational Gerontology Branch of the NIH’s National Institute on Aging, in a press conference Tuesday announcing the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taurine is a semi-essential amino acid and important micronutrient. Our bodies naturally produce taurine, though it can also easily be found in animal products, supplements, and energy drinks (people once collected taurine from bulls, but it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/energydrink/is-taurine-made-from-bulls-testicles"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; synthetically). Taurine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3501277/"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt; many roles in the body, such as helping us make bile acid and keeping our blood pressure stable. In recent years, some studies have indicated that taurine—or rather, the loss of taurine—might also be a key driver of our worsening health as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2023 study that looked at several different animal models, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taurine levels circulating in the blood declined as the animals aged. When the researchers added taurine supplements to the animals’ diets, it appeared to slightly extend the lifespan of mice and worms in addition to improving the health of older monkeys. The study also found an association between lower taurine levels in humans and an increased risk of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this wasn’t the first research to suggest taurine’s anti-aging potential, it certainly sparked people’s attention, including the authors behind this latest research. Not every bit of research on the topic has supported this link, however, and many studies have only analyzed taurine in people and animals at a single point in time or for a relatively brief period. The researchers behind the new study wanted to take a closer look at how these levels fluctuated over time across different species and in both males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They turned to other existing studies or projects involving people, mice, and rhesus monkeys that had longitudinal data on taurine levels in the blood—meaning they could track these levels across the lifespan. Overall, they found that taurine levels didn’t decline in any of the animals or humans they studied; if anything, taurine levels usually increased over time in different groups (the sole exception being male mice). They also found that differences in taurine levels between individuals could sometimes vary significantly, and that these differences were usually larger than the changes seen over an animal’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, there doesn’t appear to be much of a connection at all between taurine and aging, at least in this research. “On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are still findings from a single study, so more research will be needed to settle the question. The results also don’t mean that taurine isn’t important to our health. And it is still possible that low taurine levels can contribute to chronic health problems, including conditions that become more common as we age. Likewise, there may be some older people with low taurine who would benefit from increasing their intake.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Vijay Yadav, one of the authors behind the 2023 study, and his colleagues are currently running a randomized clinical trial testing whether taurine supplements can improve the health and fitness of middle-aged adults. He expects the trial to conclude by the end of 2025, with analysis coming soon after. For now, though, Yadav isn’t saying that people should be downing taurine like it’s candy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We cannot really recommend any supplementation. We need to have a better understanding if it does or it does not [improve health]; that can only be addressed by a placebo controlled trial,” said Yadav in the same press conference Tuesday. “And of course there are a lot more questions that need to be addressed before you can really understand the biology to more depth of a particular molecule.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly things people can already do to stay healthier into their golden years, such as exercising regularly, the track record for anti-aging drugs or supplements overall remains spotty for the time being. And it seems that a universal fountain of youth—if we can ever truly find it—probably won’t contain any taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Cumberland County Animal Services confirmed a case of rabies in a fox Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A home inspector was completing an inspection of a crawl space under a home off Garden Court in Fayetteville when he was bitten by an adult fox. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal services confined, captured and euthanized the fox. The fox’s remains were sent to the N.C. State Public Health Lab, where it was tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The home inspector is receiving medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the second case of confirmed rabies found in &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/state/cumberland-county-rabies-case-april-2025/"&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/a&gt; in the last two months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is the third reported in the last month in the Triangle, after a man strangled a coyote and later &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/coyote-attacks-roxboro-man-rabies-positive-person-co-health-officials-may-2025/"&gt;tested positive for rabies in Roxboro&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/raleigh-rabies-wild-fox-june-2025/"&gt;wild fox found in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; also tested positive, though it is believed it had no contact with other humans or animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no confirmation that these cases are linked. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cumberland County Animal Services urges all pet owners to check the rabies vaccination status of their pets. If pets are not vaccinated or are due for a booster shot, they should be taken to a local veterinarian for rabies vaccination immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The first sign of rabies in animals is usually a change in behavior. Signs of rabies in animals can include aggressive behavior, attacking for no reason, or becoming very quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wild animals can lose their fear of people and seem tame. Rabid animals may walk in a circle, drag a leg or fall over. Some cannot swallow, are unable to eat or drink, and often drool. Animals usually die within a week after first becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wildlife experts advise people to make loud noises and wave their arms to scare away any suspicious wildlife. Here are some other tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from animals you don't know.

It says that 90 percent of patients diagnosed with nAMD are considered legally blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the condition, new, abnormal and fragile blood vessels grow on the macula — an area in the center of the eye behind central, high-resolution, color vision — and may then leak blood and fluid onto it, causing damage and loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it isn't clear exactly what causes the condition, the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that it could be due to shifts in hormones in the eye sparking the growth of more blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525"&gt;JAMA Opthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists extracted data on 139,000 adults in Ontario, Canada, from the ICES database — which collects data on patients in the province from public sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the patients had type 2 diabetes, and they were 66 years old on average. Some 46 percent were female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 46,000 were prescribed a weight loss drug like Ozempic for at least six months — while the rest took different diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over three years, researchers recorded 93 cases of nAMD in the weight loss drug group (or 0.2 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the group not using the drug, there were 88 cases (or 0.1 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Real Housewives of New Jersey star Dolores Catania admitted to using Ozempic to lose weight for the six weeks ahead of the RHNJ reunion.

He has lost vision in both his eyes after taking the weight loss and type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said: 'An explanation for the increasing risk with prolonged exposure is that the retina contains receptors for GLP-1, and [these] are known to increase the levels of CXCL12.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said CXCL12 is a substance that attracts white blood cells, with this possibly causing the growth of new blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the patients, 97 percent were reported to be on a semaglutide — which includes semaglutide — while the rest were on lixisenatide — brand name Adlyxin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists started tracking the individuals between January 2020 and November 2023 for up to three years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic's maker Novo Nordisk is already facing several lawsuits from people who say that the drug robbed them of their sight — including Todd Engel, a 62-year-old type 2 diabetic who lost vision in his right eye just four months after he started using the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, his doctors had no clue the jabs could be linked to it, and dismissed it as a coincidence — leading him to continue to use them. Six months later, he also lost vision in his left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the damage is permanent and that Engle will never see again —  with the most he can perceive being faint pinpricks of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a rare condition that cuts off blood flow to the optic nerve and causes permanent vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) causes fibrosis (scarring) and can lead to cirrhosis and is linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the vast majority of people do not know they have the condition. An international group of researchers examined prevalence and diagnosis of aggressive fatty liver disease in the US, UK, Germany and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found that just under 3% of people in the UK, France and Germany, and 4% of those in the US have MASH, but diagnosis rates were below 18%. That means about 20 million people in the US, UK, Germany and France are living with MASH but only 2.5 million people have a diagnosis, leaving more than three-quarters – about 16.7 million people – unaware they have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report, published in the Lancet Regional Health Europe&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the meeting of the global thinktank on &lt;a href="https://sldthinktank.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;steatotic liver disease&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday, calls for a doubling in diagnosis rates from 2022 levels. Traditionally, MASH was diagnosed through biopsy, but now non-invasive methods such as blood tests, ultrasound and MRI scans can be used. As a result, everyone with type 2 diabetes; obesity combined with one or more other risk factors; and those with persistently high liver enzymes should be screened for MASH, the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jeffrey Lazarus, the lead author of the paper and a professor of global health in New York and Barcelona, said: “Undiagnosed MASH costs economies billions of pounds in lost productivity and poor health. Unless diagnosis rates are doubled, alongside similar increases in treatment and care, direct health costs alone are predicted to triple over the next 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Emmanouil Tsochatzis, a professor of hepatology at University College London and a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Free hospital, said: “More than 15 million people across the US and Europe have the deadliest form of fatty liver disease – and don’t know it. Without faster diagnosis and access to treatment, the human and economic toll will skyrocket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research has also prompted renewed calls for weight loss jabs to be used to treat MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Contraception warning over weight-loss drugs after dozens of pregnancies","elementId":"09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/05/contraception-warning-over-weight-loss-drugs-after-dozens-of-pregnancies"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Paul Brennan, a co-author of the Lancet paper and a hepatologist at NHS Tayside, said: “GLP-1s (including Wegovy and Mounjaro) offer the potential to resynchronise our metabolism, by introducing feelings of satiety – fullness – and delaying the time the stomach takes to empty. These effects often result in reduced calorie intake, and improvements in how the liver handles nutrients as a result of weight loss, thus reducing scar tissue formation in the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Michael Betel, the president of the Fatty Liver Alliance, said: “Too many people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity are never tested for MASH until it’s too late. We need a huge increase in liver health assessments in patients living with these diseases, alongside lifestyle changes and for some, when appropriate, weight loss drugs to reduce blood sugar and appetite. While weight loss drugs weren’t created to treat liver disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2413258" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; suggest they could benefit multiple metabolic-related conditions, and improve our liver health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Separately a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj-2024-083735" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday found that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin, which reduces blood sugar levels, can also reduce fat levels and fibrosis in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPNWR4dlJtaHZlWkt5dUpHZjhlOGR4LXpKemQwVTZRWTQzUF8tRXZoWGVyODI4SFVJdzdVYV9PeWF3WWdUQ2xjTUxyQVUyOTk3MDBGVHkyMjU0bndFVzJvVzB5QUxLTnRBTUVBS2FqRnJhcDk1emRLVW03T3JldFM1QWZkQnJRelRWdjh0U2JfRVRHdnNzYWpGTDRGWUpQN3NmOWlDSEZJYTJqN1RrQXNKeDM1aVRKeGlEVXlxejBYTmhuaXpfQ0hV</guid></item><item><title>“人工智能科学家”发现，常见的非癌症药物，当组合时，可以杀死癌细胞- Earth.com | 'AI scientist' discovers that common non-cancer drugs, when combined, can kill cancer cells - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWWY2My03VGxiaVlaNVFReDhzNG9aU0puRWhTanRjdnowelZVSV9tMkJJOHQ5YWhDd3JSWV9QbkIxZFAwWC0tSXQxc0tva3ZLaUdTTVV6cl9leVJJRWh5cEsxczRJSkxDYXhOeVRjanBxdFk4Q3RVeDhnaWs3Y1BvM01WTFVKQWZMOEdkU0l4elk0UHJ1NWxLYjZ6MmpZU2M4YjhIM3NCMmpGTU9DQ0c3WlFzWlVpUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI has already transformed fields like image recognition and translation, researchers are now exploring its potential in discovery-driven tasks, exploring how different drugs interact with cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting applications is hypothesis generation, something that was once thought to be the domain of human curiosity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study, led by researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;King’s College London&lt;/a&gt; and Arctoris Ltd, tested this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could AI suggest &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-transforming-pollen-science-and-health-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; for breast cancer using drugs not originally meant to fight cancer? Could those suggestions lead to real, testable breakthroughs in the lab? The results suggest the answer might be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-finds-new-drug-ideas-for-cancer"&gt;AI finds new drug ideas for cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research focused on GPT-4, a large language model (LLM) that is trained on vast amounts of internet text. The team designed prompts that asked GPT-4 to generate pairs of drugs that could work against MCF7 breast cancer cells but not harm healthy cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4493126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MCF10A&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also restricted the model from using known cancer drugs and instructed it to prioritize options that were affordable and already approved for use in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not automation replacing scientists, but a new kind of collaboration,” said Dr. Hector Zenil from King’s College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guided by expert prompts and experimental feedback, the AI functioned like a tireless research partner, rapidly navigating an immense hypothesis space and proposing ideas that would take humans alone far longer to reach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first round, GPT-4 proposed 12 unique drug combinations. Interestingly, all combinations included drugs not traditionally associated with cancer therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included medications for conditions like high cholesterol, parasitic infections, and alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, these combinations were not arbitrary. GPT-4 provided rationales for each pairing, often tying together biological pathways in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-combos-work-well"&gt;Some combos work well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to test the drug pairs in the lab. Scientists measured two things: how well each combination attacked MCF7 cells and how much damage was caused to MCF10A cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also evaluated whether the drug pairs worked better together than separately, a property known as synergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three combinations stood out for having better results than standard cancer therapies. One involved simvastatin and disulfiram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another paired dipyridamole with mebendazole. A third involved itraconazole and atenolol. These drug pairs were not only effective against MCF7 cells, but they worked without overly harming healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supervised LLMs offer a scalable, imaginative layer of scientific exploration, and can help us as human scientists explore new paths that we hadn’t thought of before,” said Professor Ross King from Cambridge’s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-and-humans-improve-ideas-together"&gt;AI and humans improve ideas together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first set of results, the researchers asked GPT-4 to analyze what had worked and suggest new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shared summaries of the lab findings and prompted the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-helps-humans-have-20-minute-conversation-with-humpback-whale-named-twain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; to propose four more drug combinations, including some involving known cancer drugs like fulvestrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the AI returned combinations such as disulfiram with quinacrine and mebendazole with quinacrine. Three of the four new suggestions again showed promising synergy scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective combinations was disulfiram with simvastatin, which achieved the highest synergy score of the entire study at over 10 on the HSA scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop, AI suggesting ideas, humans testing them, then feeding results back to the AI, represents a novel way of conducting science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process no longer moves in one direction. Instead, it cycles, with both machine and human adjusting and improving as they learn from each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-found-surprising-cancer-combos"&gt;AI found surprising cancer combos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the twelve original combinations, six showed positive synergy scores for MCF7 cancer cells. These included unusual pairings like furosemide and mebendazole or disulfiram and hydroxychloroquine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, eight of these twelve combinations had greater effects on MCF7 cells than on MCF10A cells, indicating good specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most toxic drugs to MCF7 cells included disulfiram, quinacrine, niclosamide, and dipyridamole. Disulfiram had the lowest IC50 value, meaning it required only a small dose to reduce cell viability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4’s ability to find such effective non-cancer drugs and pair them meaningfully surprised even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study demonstrates how AI can be woven directly into the iterative loop of scientific discovery, enabling adaptive, data-informed hypothesis generation and validation in real time,” said Zenil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hallucinations-as-creative-leaps"&gt;Hallucinations as creative leaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 sometimes makes mistakes. These are called hallucinations, statements not supported by its training data. In most cases, hallucinations are flaws. But in hypothesis generation, they can be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, one such hallucination involved the claim that itraconazole affects cell membrane integrity in human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is true for fungi, human cells do not use the same biological pathway. Yet, this flawed idea still led to successful experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The capacity of supervised LLMs to propose hypotheses across disciplines, incorporate prior results, and collaborate across iterations marks a new frontier in scientific research,” said King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-may-help-tailor-cancer-treatments"&gt;AI may help tailor cancer treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team believes that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-can-alert-doctors-when-patients-might-get-sicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and lab automation could eventually reduce the cost of personalized medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment might one day involve a custom research project for each patient. Instead of general prescriptions, therapies could be tested and tailored in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of running a lab remains high, but AI like GPT-4 drastically cuts down the time and effort required to generate useful hypotheses. With further advances in robotics, the physical testing process might also become cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our empirical results demonstrate that the GPT-4 succeeded in its primary task of forming novel and useful hypotheses,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-future-science"&gt;What this means for future science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows that AI can do more than summarize or analyze. It can take part in generating new scientific knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 didn’t just crunch numbers. It offered unexpected ideas, learned from outcomes, and improved its suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combinations it proposed still need clinical trials. They are far from becoming approved treatments. But their success in lab settings highlights the potential of repurposing safe, existing drugs for new uses, something that could save years of development time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of The Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;arXiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:07:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWWY2My03VGxiaVlaNVFReDhzNG9aU0puRWhTanRjdnowelZVSV9tMkJJOHQ5YWhDd3JSWV9QbkIxZFAwWC0tSXQxc0tva3ZLaUdTTVV6cl9leVJJRWh5cEsxczRJSkxDYXhOeVRjanBxdFk4Q3RVeDhnaWs3Y1BvM01WTFVKQWZMOEdkU0l4elk0UHJ1NWxLYjZ6MmpZU2M4YjhIM3NCMmpGTU9DQ0c3WlFzWlVpUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， GLP-1药物可能与严重眼疾风险升高有关- statnews.com | GLP-1 drugs may be linked to elevated risk of serious eye disease, study finds - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPTkx6akk4bWtlNnNjTHpGaFQ4Rk5ERDItekE4dWk1bW1JY1h5TTdhYUxQX0RBSE01cVRld2RzaTNYTjdyLXl6OE1BOHpqWXJEbjZ6dS11cVo1Ymg3RUxXdUNCYnFBMFJvZTZ4cVdtQlZjRXRJd3EyTndmRXFJV09kaThWUUFSVW5XbGtMQmFHRnd0cUZJSG1kU2ZRX0RlZmdQQzRERUxSekVQZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes who were taking GLP-1 drugs had a low but elevated risk of an age-related eye disease that can sometimes lead to blindness, a new observational study concludes, adding to a short list of concerns about eye health in people taking the powerful medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, found that after one year, more than twice as many people on GLP-1 drugs developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared to similar people who were not taking the drugs. The risk was 0.2% in people taking GLP-1s and 0.1% in those who didn’t. Participants, drawn from health records of nearly 140,000 patients in Canada, were matched for socioeconomic status and a long list of conditions in addition to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AMD is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in older people; the study participants were 66 years old, on average. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease, known for its abnormal growth of blood vessels and damage to the central part of the retina called the macula. It can be treated with frequent injections to potentially restore or stabilize vision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People at risk for nAMD share the same conditions — chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease — that make patients with diabetes candidates for GLP-1s. Aware of other eye problems in people taking GLP-1s, researchers looked for a relationship between the drugs and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seeing such a clear signal in our study was striking,” co-author Reut Shor of the University of Toronto told STAT. “The absolute risk remains low, but the advanced form of AMD is a condition with serious implications for vision and quality of life. So a doubling of risk is clinically meaningful, particularly for vulnerable populations like older adults who may already be at elevated baseline risk.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Famous for their success in helping people lose weight, GLP-1 drugs were originally intended to control their blood sugar. Since then, they’ve shown promise in countering cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Parkinson disease, and substance use disorders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As their use has taken off, though, more eye problems have been reported, including abnormal blood vessel growth. It’s not unusual for rare side effects to show up when more people take a drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cases of this &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1901118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retinopathy&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in two studies of people with diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and a history of GLP-1 usage for 20 or 24 months. The risk of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/03/ozempic-wegovy-naion-vision-loss-study/"&gt;nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,&lt;/a&gt; when the optic nerve’s blood flow is blocked, was also found to be higher in people on GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s a common cause, researchers speculate that it might be plunging blood glucose levels spurred by GLP-1s that trigger abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. The new study can’t prove that, or even connect cause and effect, its authors emphasize, but their results add to concern about safety and eye health of people being treated for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diabetes itself has long been known to cause retinal degeneration because of too much blood sugar, something that drugs like the standby metformin have been able to control. The issue with GLP-1s may go beyond blood sugar, though. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are GLP-1 receptors in the retina, the authors write, and GLP-1 drugs increase the levels of molecules that lead to harmful blood vessel formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study raises questions about whether direct or indirect effects are driving the increased risk of nAMD. The next steps for the research would ideally include studies in animal models and human tissue to determine the mechanism, as well as large, prospective clinical studies in diverse populations to further clarify causality, Shor said. It would also be important to study people without diabetes who are using GLP-1s for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Shor said, these results should not cause alarm or abrupt changes in prescribing, but they do warrant greater awareness and appropriate monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means patients should promptly report any new visual symptoms, such as blurred or distorted vision, straight lines appearing wavy, or new blind spots. These symptoms could indicate early signs of AMD, Shor said, and should trigger an immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether discontinuing the drug at that point would lessen risk for AMD remains an open question that future research might answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian VanderBeek of the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania said further research is also needed to pin down the association between the drug and higher rates of eye disease. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;companion editorial&lt;/a&gt;, he points out that follow-up studies of diabetic retinal disease and neuropathy in people taking GLP-1s showed the risks were lower than initially thought. But the new paper does cause concern. If its findings are borne out, he writes, as many as 1 in 1,000 GLP-1 users might develop nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 RAs have had a tremendous role in the care of patients with diabetes and now those needing additional help with weight management,” VenderBeek writes. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yersinia pestis—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the bacterium that causes the bubonic plague—experienced a genetic tweak that allowed rodents to live longer after they were infected, according to a new study. This alteration may have prolonged two significant plague pandemics, including the deadliest event in human history: the Black Death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at the Institut Pasteur in France and McMaster University in Canada studied hundreds of ancient &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;DNA samples to investigate a gene called “pla.” Their study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published May 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, identified a decrease in repetitions of the pla gene in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/i&gt; genome during the later stages of both the first and second major plague pandemics. The researchers believe these pla depletions ultimately allowed these pandemics to last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first plague pandemic, known as the Plague of Justinian, struck the Mediterranean basin during the sixth century and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903797116"&gt;&lt;span&gt;caused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tens of millions of deaths over the course of two centuries. The second emerged when the Black Death broke out in 1347, killing an estimated 30% to 50% of Europe’s population in just six years. But this was just the beginning. Like the first pandemic, this plague continued to reemerge for centuries, lasting more than 500 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This newly discovered evolution of the pla gene offers more insight into how these plagues persisted for so long. &lt;span&gt;The pla gene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; appears many times in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis’&lt;/i&gt; genome and plays a crucial role in its virulence by allowing it to infect the lymph nodes before traveling to the rest of the body, according to an Institut Pasteur &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/plague-bacillus-became-less-virulent-prolonging-duration-two-major-pandemics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This causes rapid septicemia—or blood poisoning—and quickly kills the victim. Therefore, a lack of this gene in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/i&gt;strains from the first and second major pandemics likely made the bacterium less virulent, the researchers suggest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To test that hypothesis, they infected mice with three preserved strains of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;from the third major pandemic that also had fewer repetitions of pla. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These three samples enabled us to analyze the biological impact of these pla gene deletions,” said co-author Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, director of the Yersinia Research Unit at the Institut Pasteur, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through their mouse model, Pizarro-Cerdá and his colleagues found that the pla depletion resulted in a 20% decrease in victim mortality. What’s more, it allowed infected rodents to live significantly longer. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that rats infected with pla-depleted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;strains may have been more effective disease vectors, as they had more time to spread the plague far and wide before they died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Rodents—particularly rats—played a critical role in spreading the bubonic plague to humans. People most commonly contract this disease via infected flea bites, and fleas typically contract it when they feed on infected rodents. Thus, an increase in the lifespans of sickened rodents would have provided greater opportunity for fleas to bite them, become infected, and then bite humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ours is one of the first research studies to directly examine changes in an ancient pathogen, one we still see today, in an attempt to understand what drives the virulence, persistence, and eventual extinction of pandemics,” said co-lead author Hendrik Poinar, director of the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre and holder of the Michael G. DeGroote Chair in Genetic Anthropology, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, the bubonic plague is considered a rare disease, though a small number of cases still emerge in western North America, Africa, Asia, and South America, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21590-bubonic-plague"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While this research provides valuable insight into the evolutionary history of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the world-altering pandemics it caused, it can also serve as a model for better understanding how deadly diseases emerge and spread, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            The United States is facing an alarming increase in overdose deaths among young people due to synthetic opioids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2znz4001o3b6mj0axw5gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, increased &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db491.htm#:~:text=The%20age%2Dadjusted%20rate%20of%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20synthetic,rates%20of%20change%20over%20time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 20-fold&lt;/a&gt; between 2013 and 2022, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000p3b6m6ls8f2mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overdoses and drug poisonings are now the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in people under age 20, behind firearms and motor vehicle crashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000q3b6mcb6hhoev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overdose death counts among US youth ages 15 to 24 rose from 4,652 to 6,723 between 2018 and 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/6/e2024069488/201955/Changes-in-Synthetic-Opioid-Involved-Youth" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Pediatrics. (A slight decrease occurred between 2021 and 2022.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000r3b6m29btblh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest increase was seen in deaths involving only synthetic opioids: Since 2020, fatal overdoses involving only these substances were higher than overdoses in which multiple substances were implicated. Overdose rates were nearly 2.5 times higher among male youths compared with female youths and more than two times higher among those ages 20 to 24 compared with those ages 15 to 19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000s3b6mds1apumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a parent, I wanted to know more about synthetic opioids and their uses. Why are they so dangerous, and how are overdoses treated? How can people tell if the drugs they are taking contain synthetic opioids? Crucially, what can parents and other family members do to help reduce the risk of overdose?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000t3b6mx42dmsnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Previously, she served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where she oversaw the city’s opioid prevention strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are synthetic opioids? What are they used for?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200113b6mmdtxl772@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Prescription opioids are medications used to treat severe pain. They must be used with caution, however, because if they are used in higher than prescribed doses or otherwise incorrectly, they can result in drowsiness, slowed and shallow breathing, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200123b6mnb5hbjvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Opioids can be classified by where they originate. So-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/glossary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;natural opioids&lt;/a&gt; are derived from the poppy plant and include drugs such as morphine and codeine. Semisynthetic opioids include oxycodone and hydrocodone. Synthetic opioids are made in the laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200133b6m0wo5ojkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The synthetic opioid most implicated in fatal overdoses is &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. There are other synthetic opioids too, such as tramadol and methadone. Methadone is also used as a treatment for people with opioid use disorder. Notably, the CDC’s statistics and the new study in Pediatrics do not include methadone in their calculation of fatal overdoses due to synthetic opioids. The &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of synthetic overdose deaths in the US involve fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200143b6mlvi9akt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there legitimate medical uses of fentanyl?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200153b6mvdd82i4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Fentanyl is often used in emergency settings to treat acute pain. For instance, someone who was in a high-speed car accident and just broke their hip needs immediate pain relief. It is also given to patients who have chronic pain that is not relieved by other methods. Some cancer patients with intractable pain use a fentanyl patch or fentanyl lozenge, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200163b6maotuvkhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current trend of youth overdoses is probably not mostly due to fentanyl being diverted from legitimate medical purposes. In recent years, there has been a significant problem with fentanyl being made in illegal labs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200173b6mi1trpe7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Synthetic fentanyl is sold illegally as a powder dropped onto blotter paper, put in eyedroppers and nasal sprays or, perhaps most terrifyingly, as pills that resemble other prescription pills, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200183b6mqj36s29c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, fentanyl is often mixed in with other drugs. People who think they are taking amphetamines, oxycodone, cocaine, heroin, MDMA (also known as ecstasy) or other “party drugs” may be unknowingly taking fentanyl. Depending on the amount of fentanyl they are ingesting, they could overdose and die.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What makes fentanyl especially dangerous?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001a3b6mw934cixn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; To begin, fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/health/fentanyl-visual-guide/index.html"&gt;50 to 100 times&lt;/a&gt; more potent than morphine. A small amount can lead to oversedation and death. People may not realize how dangerous fentanyl is or even that what they are taking has fentanyl in it. There have been numerous cases of high school and college-age students who have died after being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/us/campbell-fentanyl-dangers/index.html"&gt;given fentanyl-laced pills.&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How are overdoses treated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatment for opioid overdose is the medication &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt;, also sometimes referred to by its brand name Narcan. It is available as a nasal spray and as an intramuscular injection. The nasal spray is available over the counter for under $50. Some health insurance plans will cover naloxone, and some state and local health departments may give out this medication free of charge. If given immediately after someone loses consciousness, it could reverse the overdose and save someone’s life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001d3b6m8crwcgen@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Individuals who come to after getting naloxone should still receive immediate medical care. They may need additional doses of naloxone, and they could need treatment for other potentially dangerous substances they have taken.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001e3b6mz68vcpk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can people tell if the drugs they are taking contain synthetic opioids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001f3b6mdlivo4m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an important question — the answer is that people can’t easily tell if the drug they are taking contains fentanyl. Counterfeit medications can look exactly like the prescription form. If fentanyl is mixed in with cocaine or other illicit drugs, it’s not possible to tell based on simply looking at the substance, as fentanyl is odorless and colorless.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001g3b6mipurul72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/stopoverdose/fentanyl/fentanyl-test-strips.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fentanyl test strips&lt;/a&gt; can check for the presence of fentanyl in the drug supply. While the use of these strips can reduce overdose risk, know that just because one pill in the supply doesn’t contain fentanyl doesn’t mean that others all don’t. Moreover, these strips don’t test for other contaminants that can also be deadly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001h3b6m0i78vnsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I want to share another key number: Of the fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills analyzed in 2022 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration Laboratory, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain" target="_blank"&gt;6 out of 10&lt;/a&gt; contained a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. This is a sobering statistic and should be reason enough for people never to use illicit prescription pills or other illegal substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can parents and other family members do to help reduce the risk of overdose?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001j3b6m1yop63id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents should speak with their children about the danger of counterfeit and illicit drugs. It doesn’t matter if parents used drugs when they were younger. Drugs today are so much more powerful and dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001k3b6mbcd54dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should never take medications that don’t belong to them. They don’t know where the medications came from, if the medications are really what they claim to be, and whether they have contaminants such as fentanyl in which even a small amount could be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001l3b6m8ejupvkk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I think it’s also good practice to have naloxone accessible. As I mentioned, this medication is now available &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness"&gt;over the counter&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone can learn to use it and have it in their medicine cabinet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This gentle technique significantly improves cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage—a critical function that declines with age and contributes to cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used fluorescent tracers in mice and monkeys to uncover a new drainage pathway connecting facial lymphatics to deep lymph nodes, which remains intact even in older individuals. A handheld device that lightly strokes the skin restored youthful CSF flow in aged animals, opening up exciting potential for wearable treatments that prevent or slow neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drainage Route:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists mapped a previously unknown CSF drainage pathway through facial lymphatics to submandibular nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle mechanical stimulation of the face and neck enhanced CSF clearance without drugs or surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Proof Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Superficial facial lymphatics retain function in aging, making them ideal targets for therapeutic stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have uncovered a non-invasive method to boost the brain’s natural waste drainage system—a discovery that could open new avenues for tackling age-related neurological disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature, researchers from the IBS Center for Vascular Research, led by Director KOH Gou Young, along with senior researchers JIN Hokyung, YOON Jin-Hui, and principal researcher HONG Seon Pyo, demonstrated that precisely stimulating the lymphatics under skin on the neck and face can significantly enhance the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—the liquid that cushions the brain and helps remove toxic waste—through lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110671"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a new approach to clearing brain waste using safe, non-invasive mechanical stimulation, rather than relying on drugs or surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain produces waste at a high rate compared to other organs, and clearing it efficiently is essential for healthy brain function. This clearance is primarily carried out by CSF, which removes harmful substances such as amyloid-β and tau proteins—key factors in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, as we age, this drainage slows down, contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBS Center for Vascular Research previously published landmark studies in Nature (2019 and 2024) demonstrating that CSF drains to deep cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatic vessels at the base of the skull and the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus. They also showed that age-related degeneration of these lymphatics impairs CSF clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found that CSF drainage could be enhanced or suppressed pharmacologically by targeting cervical lymphatic vessels outside the skull. However, clinical applications remained limited because these lymphatics are located too deep in the neck for non-invasive access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research not only completed the map of cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways that clear brain waste, but also provided a new method to enhance CSF drainage from outside the brain,” stated KOH Gou Young, Center Director and corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect this will serve as a milestone for future research on neurodegenerative diseases including dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using genetically modified mice and monkeys with fluorescent tracers, the researchers have mapped out a new CSF drainage route from the brain to superficial cervical lymph nodes—via a network of lymphatic vessels in the face, nose, and hard palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older animals, many of these routes had degenerated—except for the vessels just beneath the facial skin, which retained full functionality despite aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We confirmed that lymphatic vessels beneath facial skin connect to submandibular lymph nodes through various pathways,” explained JIN Hokyung, Senior Researcher and co-first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through these connections, we can regulate the reduced cerebrospinal fluid drainage function seen in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to determine how this newly identified pathway can be applied in actual patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this, the team developed a force-regulated mechanical stimulator—a handheld device that gently presses and strokes the skin in a controlled manner. When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that we found a safer and more effective method to enhance cerebrospinal fluid drainage from outside the skull,” said YOON Jin-Hui, co-first author and neurovascular physiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are conducting follow-up studies to investigate how this newly identified drainage pathway is altered in various brain disease patients and how this new stimulation method can be applied therapeutically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could pave the way for wearable or clinical devices that enhance brain waste clearance in older adults or patients with neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now investigating how this drainage system behaves in diseases like Alzheimer’s—and whether mechanical stimulation could serve as a preventive or therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

ENCELTO is a surgically implanted device that delivers a steady dose of a neuroprotective protein called CNTF to preserve retinal cells and slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals with foundational research from Scripps and the Lowy Medical Research Institute, the device has shown long-term efficacy in clinical trials. Its approval marks a major milestone in neurodegenerative disease treatment, being the first cell-based implant to deliver a neuroprotectant for such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-of-Its-Kind Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; ENCELTO is the first approved therapy for MacTel and the first implant to deliver a neuroprotectant for neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Devices continued producing CNTF up to 14.5 years post-implantation, with strong effects shown over 24 months in trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are now investigating ENCELTO’s use in diseases like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people diagnosed with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel)—a rare and slowly progressing retinal disease—there have been no FDA-approved (or other) treatments to slow or stop vision loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed on March 6, 2025, with the approval of ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), a surgically implanted device designed to preserve sight in people with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110667"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/eye-implant-retina-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;MacTel affects the central part of the retina, which is essential for sharp, detailed vision. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by the biotech company Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, ENCELTO’s origins stem from a long-standing partnership between the Scripps Research lab of physician-scientist Martin Friedlander and the Lowy Medical Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the 17th FDA-approved therapy to emerge from work at Scripps Research. The device is expected to be available to U.S. patients in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Lowy family’s commitment to finding a treatment through their extraordinary support of the MacTel Project and the Lowy Medical Research Institute—combined with the work produced by Scripps Research, Neurotech, and an international consortium of scientists and clinicians—is a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of basic science in developing effective treatments for debilitating diseases,” says Friedlander, whose research, along with that of others, helped pave the way for ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel affects the central part of the retina, which is essential for sharp, detailed vision. People with the disease often have trouble reading, recognizing faces or seeing fine detail—symptoms that gradually worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To slow this progression, ENCELTO delivers a steady dose of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein that supports the survival and health of nerve cells—including photoreceptors in the retina. CNTF acts as a neuroprotectant, meaning it helps shield these cells from damage to delay the degenerative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s approval was supported by two phase 3 clinical studies showing that the ENCELTO implant slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells in people with MacTel over a 24-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices removed from patients’ eyes after as long as 14.5 years still produced levels of CNTF comparable to what they were producing at the time of implantation, suggesting the device should remain efficacious well beyond the 2 years observed in the trials. This is being examined further in extended phase 4 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time a cell-based therapy delivering a neuroprotectant has been approved to treat a neurodegenerative disease,” notes Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, Friedlander played an active role in shaping ENCELTO’s scientific foundation and helped lay the groundwork for its clinical development through earlier work from his Scripps Research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel was initially believed to be a blood vessel disorder because early imaging showed abnormal, leaky capillaries near the center of the retina. But Friedlander and his lab helped reveal that the real issue was neurodegeneration—the gradual death of photoreceptors and supporting glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a key proof-of-concept study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt; in 2009, they showed that gene therapy could be used to deliver a neuroprotectant directly to the retina in a preclinical model resembling the disease, effectively slowing or preventing cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This early success paved the way for further development of ENCELTO. A few years later, a member of the Lowy family was diagnosed with MacTel. The family’s search for a treatment became the driving force behind developing a lasting, targeted therapy for MacTel—which would eventually become ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on his 2009 findings, Friedlander began looking for a way to deliver CNTF to patients in a safe and sustained manner. He reconnected with Neurotech—a company he had worked with in the 1990s—to explore utilizing one of its devices originally developed to treat other retinal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they explored the use of a tiny, collagen-based capsule containing genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which help nourish the retina and support photoreceptor health. Once implanted in the back of the eye, the device releases CNTF in a controlled, long-term way while shielding RPE cells from attack by the body’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENCELTO is also being evaluated for neurovascular degenerative conditions beyond MacTel. Friedlander’s lab is now exploring its potential to deliver other therapeutic molecules for diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The retina is an extension of the brain, so this also implies that a neuroprotectant could be used to prevent neurodegeneration in other diseases,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that ENCELTO’s success is the culmination of years of research, persistence and problem-solving by many people—from the earliest lab studies to the final stages of clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no greater satisfaction for a clinician-scientist than to be able to find a treatment that will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of patients,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tremendously rewarding to take something from the lab bench and actually bring it to the bedside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89f9fbecfafac9faeafbe0f9f9faa7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Press Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Press Office – Scripps Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:36:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9fZy1fVXRvaTRLejFqdG5DSjE1c25nV1F2NWo5ZWRhcVQ3SGNuMEVueVFuRFFHN1o2TGdRazJFNkpJeHQ2b2o1dUdHbDJrdXRKeEJ2NjMzUzhIU1NkdGMwYnBtOFBOdjZheTI0ZzBoNS1FZDhkQ280YjRUeVpyUHc</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性每年应该喝不超过六杯葡萄酒-《每日电讯报》 | Why women should drink no more than six glasses of wine a year - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5qVEVLRUpreTVOMUNNa2hYeW94QU9INU9vNlF1S2ZmTTh0R09FVFI0TDdoLTJ3TFJHU0pTNGdHa2pKZVhncmREeVdBT2h6U0ZycF9oTlAySjFvbjg5M2V6cl82aG4xVFk1UVNqcVREWkRTM2RnQTUwLUNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Women who drink four of these drinks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the course of a weekend, meanwhile, are at a 12 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have four drinks of this size every weekend, around 13 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While having alcohol-free days can improve your health, there are added dangers to drinking large amounts of alcohol in one sitting, says Dr Rumgay. One study she worked on in the past found that “the risk of breast cancer was increased by 40 per cent in women that had had any occasion of heavy episodic drinking in the year leading up to the research,” she says. We might not think of it as such, but the WHO classes “heavy episodic drinking” or binge drinking as consuming 60g of pure alcohol or more in a single drinking session. That’s equivalent to just over two large glasses of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into the effects of weekend-only drinking is still ongoing, but “premenopausal women who binge drink seem to be twice as likely to develop breast cancer,” says Prof Stordal. “There is some confidence in the notion that having this carcinogenic compound in your system in high concentrations after a weekend of drinking could be more dangerous compared with having the same quantity over the course of a longer period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink three times a week are at a 9 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink three times a week, around 12 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives, not including other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a break between the days that you visit the pub or have a glass of wine with your dinner is certainly good for your health, says Dr Rumgay. “Drinking frequently can lead to systemic inflammation of the body,” she explains. “If you cut the number of days that you drink, or spread them out, then it’s possible that your body has more time to recover from this inflammatory state, which could potentially avoid increasing your risk of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even this amount of alcohol can increase your cancer risk, however. Another study that Dr Rumgay worked on found that “having just half a standard drink every day increases breast cancer risk by 4 per cent,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink once a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink once a week are at a 3 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a week, around 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke. The same amount of non-drinking women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40 per cent of women in Britain drink at least once a week. The effects of having one drink each week are hard to study, however, as “most people either drink more than once a week or don’t drink at all,” says Dr Rumgay. The numbers still show that even this much alcohol consumption can increase your risk of breast cancer – though you might see a 3 per cent increased risk as something you’re willing to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink every other week are at a 2 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a few times a month, around would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors such as genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there isn’t a lot of research into this pattern of drinking, though “any amount of alcohol still increases your risk of breast cancer,” says Dr Rumgay. “The simple advice I always give is reduction,” says Prof Stordal. “Whether that’s cutting down to once a week or once every few weeks, whatever you can do will benefit you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink every few months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have fewer than six drinks over the course of a whole year are 0.3 per cent more likely to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/breast-cancer-symptoms-signs/"&gt;develop breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have one drink fewer than six times a year, 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no amount of drinking is completely safe, you may be pleased to know that you can celebrate with a drink a few times a year and only increase your risk of breast cancer marginally, “though the general consensus is that anything more than zero does raise your risk,” says Dr Rumgay.&lt;/p&gt;

A canceled effort to develop a bird flu vaccine. An infectious new COVID variant and changing federal guidance about who should get boosted. In recent weeks, drama in D.C. has buried several vaccine-related developments. Todayâ€™s newsletter explains whatâ€™s new and what it means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Last month, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926 "&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would no longer recommend that healthy children and healthy pregnant women receive COVID booster shots, altering Biden-era guidance that everyone older than 6 months get boosted annually. The CDC appeared to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;slightly soften Kennedyâ€™s guidance&lt;/a&gt;, saying that healthy kids and pregnant women â€œmayâ€� get boosters if their doctors recommend it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;The administration has tried to narrow the pool of people it says should get boosted. But where some of the changes reflect reasonable readings of the science, others do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, a top CDC official during the Biden administration, said experts debate whether younger children should get boosted. When Shah was in government, he recommended it. But many other countries donâ€™t, noting that most young children have a low risk of serious illness. The mRNA technology used in some COVID shots can also have side effects, including a condition called myocarditis that mostly affects boys and young men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But Shah, who previously led Maineâ€™s CDC and is now at Colby College, says the evidence is much less debatable in the case of pregnant women. Not only are boosters safe and effective for them, but getting them protects babies in utero and up to 6 months old &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/"&gt;who canâ€™t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The way Kennedy made the changes has also troubled experts. Normally, health agencies gather outside advisersâ€™ input before making new recommendations. But Kennedy seems to have acted unilaterally. His announcement, made in a minutelong social media video, &lt;a href="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit"&gt;surprised CDC officials&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;). â€œWhat it suggests is that some of the conclusions are foregone,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy argues that health experts made mistakes that undermined public trust during the pandemic. Shah acknowledges that, to a point. Some experts, he said, tried to squelch dissenting views or didnâ€™t effectively communicate that scientistsâ€™ understanding of COVID would evolve, causing confusion when public health guidance changed. Other experts overstated &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/ "&gt;the risk of outdoor transmission&lt;/a&gt; or supported extended school closures that caused severe learning loss &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;while doing little to contain infections&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the administrationâ€™s approach risks sowing further confusion. Kennedyâ€™s announcement conflicts with an article that two Trump-appointed FDA officials published days earlier, which listed pregnancy as one factor that puts women â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;at high risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.â€� The fact that Kennedy â€” who has long spread vaccine misinformation and says he doesnâ€™t â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;think people should be taking medical advice from me&lt;/a&gt;â€� â€” made the changes could also corrode trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhat worries me is that when we get into another emergency situation, if trust in federal health authorities has waned, thatâ€™s a problem,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, COVID keeps evolving. A variant called NB.1.8.1 has recently driven up cases in China and elsewhere. But for now, Shah isnâ€™t hugely concerned. NB.1.8.1 descended from Omicron, a variant that swept the United States in late 2021 and early 2022. So even if cases rise, existing vaccines and antibodies from prior infection will likely help protect against severe illness. The World Health Organization says the new variant â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;suggests no increased public health risk&lt;/a&gt;â€� so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;A few months ago, bird flu was spreading rapidly among cows and chickens, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;killing birds and other animals&lt;/a&gt;, and sickening dozens of people. Since then, the outbreak has slowed; the last reported human cases were in February, and only one person has died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;Bird flu may be seasonal, which &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;could explain the ebb&lt;/a&gt;. But another possibility is that cases are going unreported because fewer people are getting tested. In February, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-fired-bird-flu-hires-00206334" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;fired, and then scrambled to rehire&lt;/a&gt;, officials involved in bird flu testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Given the uncertainty, some experts have faulted the administration for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707"&gt;canceling contracts with Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop a bird flu vaccine. The effort aimed to adapt the companyâ€™s versatile mRNA technology, which Kennedy has repeatedly cast doubt on despite overwhelming evidence of safety. (The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-moderna-covid-vaccine-rcna210250" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a new mRNA COVID booster from Moderna last weekend.) Instead, the administration is funding a project aimed at developing a bird flu vaccine using technology &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;similar to seasonal flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which can take longer to produce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Cases of the highly contagious virus continue to rise nationwide, but slowly. The largest outbreak, in West Texas, seems to be abating. Three Americans have died this year, all unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;A slowing case rate is good news, although many more people could have gotten sick than the official numbers reflect. The measles vaccine is safe, highly effective, and decades old, but Kennedy was slow to full-throatedly recommend it as the outbreak grew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9" title="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9"&gt;Repeat verbatim&lt;/a&gt; | â˜€ï¸� &lt;b&gt;90Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Hot, humid, and hazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor’s offices — but also at a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/shakira-measles-new-jersey-texas-mmr-25022a0b7c69a23c27b0ccdbf818ee86" target="_blank"&gt;Shakira concert&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles060225.html" target="_blank"&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, at a &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/02/25/measles-outbreak-exposure-texas-new-braunfels-buc-ees/80309897007/" target="_blank"&gt;Buc-ee’s store in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and in airports and planes in several states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000a3b6m7lgg9e6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;recently updated travel notice&lt;/a&gt;. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000b3b6mbyn4dfjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank"&gt; measles was declared eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/" target="_blank"&gt; 85 cases&lt;/a&gt; were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiekfyp00083b6mv63s7rz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieywbg000f3b6mm7vnvrpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiez6bs000h3b6majhmf2q5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000d3b6m7ffn9kth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000f3b6m2wc0jkqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000g3b6m92llb34j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000i3b6m5d5437aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000j3b6m9psbirsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html#:~:text=Live%20virus%20vaccines%2C%20such%20as,also%20recommended%20for%20pregnant%20women." target="_blank"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifcsml000j3b6m9s9999j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifk29x000q3b6m9g9uc3po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000m3b6mfv3kh7dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000l3b6mac87ej4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidvax900003b6m9a1hxsdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie5oxo00053b6mfxq26b20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiely3x000e3b6mywvyabk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieyo4v000d3b6mw7n53f9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie8r1m00073b6mjmih0k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pack-smart" target="_blank"&gt;travel guidance&lt;/a&gt; such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list" target="_blank"&gt;country-specific travel health notices&lt;/a&gt; on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000n3b6m3a5cbal1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000o3b6m6lpffj8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5779523/" target="_blank"&gt;four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate&lt;/a&gt;. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000p3b6msvvvf0xh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieck5q00093b6mr84yusx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/urologist-reveals-the-one-trick-to-check-your-kidney-health-without-any-test-101748933204888.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="urine tests"&gt;urine tests&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A dream that Mikael Genberg has nurtured for more than a quarter century could come true today (June 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish artist's "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace"&gt;Moonhouse&lt;/a&gt;," a project he devised way back in 1999, is set to touch down on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html"&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon aboard &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt;, a lander operated by the Japanese company ispace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artwork — a tiny replica of the red-and-white houses that dot the Swedish countryside — is mounted on the front bumper of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious"&gt;Tenacious&lt;/a&gt;, a microrover built by ispace's European subsidiary. If Resilience touches down safely today and everything thereafter goes to plan as well, Tenacious will deploy from the lander and drop the Moonhouse onto the lunar dirt, giving the gray landscape a solitary spark of vibrant color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space.com caught up with Genberg via email recently to discuss the Moonhouse, how he's feeling with the touchdown try just around the corner and what a successful landing would mean to him. The questions and answers are presented below in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;"The Moonhouse" artist Mikael Genberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: The Moonhouse/Mathias Nordgren)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How and when did you first get the idea to put a little Swedish house on the moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikael Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;Working as an artist is, in many ways, about trying to describe the world, life, and human beings from different perspectives. All culture is essentially that: describing and re-describing what it means to be here. The house, as a symbol, holds in my mind a unique combination of survival and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first imagined a typical Swedish house standing on the moon, I instantly felt the power of the image, but also its impossibility. I had no competence, no funding, no connections. Still, the thought didn’t leave me. I started talking about it, first with close friends, then with others. Gradually, a sense of shared purpose, or something like that, began to form around the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the concept managed to survive, and even grow, for 26 years, carried forward by its own poetry, craziness and hardship and by the incredible support of people who believed in it. That persistence of the idea itself is kind of an artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What does this piece mean to you? What do you hope it achieves, or how do you hope it affects people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; To me, the Moonhouse is both a shared achievement, something made possible by the efforts of many individuals, but also a profoundly personal thing. Being able to touch the moon with a small house that I painted in the kitchen of our red house from 1758 creates deeper emotions than I expected. It’s like putting my finger on that distant white disc in the sky. An impossibility that comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity, and vulnerability. I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world, this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html"&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt;, packed with life, all related to each other. The Moonhouse doesn’t claim anything except maybe to be art, but even that is of no real interest. It’s a small red house standing on the moon. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How do you feel now, being so close to the lunar landing? What emotions are running through you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a strange mix of awe, anxiety, disbelief, and sheer, childish happiness. So many things have had to go right just to reach this point. There's excitement, of course, but also a deep sense of humility in understanding the challenges that still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying not to get swept away by the emotions entirely, but instead to stay present in this moment. Whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What would mission success — Tenacious deploying the Moonhouse onto the gray dirt — mean to you? What would it mean to humanity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;If it works, if the Moonhouse actually stands there on the lunar surface, I think it would be a moment of something extraordinary. Maybe more poetry than art. For me personally, it would be the culmination of imagination, persistence, and collaboration with so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for what it might mean to humanity, that's really up to each person. I love that people have already responded in their own creative ways: sending us songs, children's drawings, poems. That, to me, is success, when an idea sparks new ideas in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope the Moonhouse can become a small cultural marker. Something that says: we were here, and we brought not just our technology, but our dreams, our symbols of home. We come in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What if Resilience fails during its landing attempt on June 5? Will you still regard the Moonhouse project as a success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;That's hard to say. In the moment, I'm sure I would feel deep disappointment. But with some distance, I believe I'll be able to see how the Moonhouse has already succeeded in many ways. It exists. It was built. It sparked thoughts, conversations and creativity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I hope it lands safely. But I also accept that space missions are, by nature, super-risky. No matter what happens, the House will reach the moon. The only question is in what shape.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;On May 14, 2025, the Division of Overdose Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/10/05/overdose-may-be-decreasing--but-not-for-everyone/" target="_blank"&gt;overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 27%. This was an extraordinary, even historic announcement, given overdoses had risen relentlessly for more than 33 years, resulting in the deaths of more than a million Americans, with another 1 million projected to die before this decade is over. Now, for more than a year, overdose deaths have decreased every single month, most dramatically for deaths caused by &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;illicit fentanyl&lt;/a&gt; — considered the toughest problem, given the opioid’s high potency, simplicity of manufacture, and ease of smuggling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very same day, the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/14/rfk-jr-congress-testimony/"&gt;testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, made no reference to overdoses, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;number one killer of Americans 18 to 44 years of age&lt;/a&gt;, nor to the recent success. A week later, in his agency’s 72-page “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf"&gt;Making America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” manifesto, the word “opioid” was never mentioned. Instead, he went on to propose that CDC should be disassembled, along with the other principal agencies responsible for addressing the overdose crisis.  Those proposals, as part of the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf"&gt;2026 fiscal year budget&lt;/a&gt;,  passed the House and await action by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly thirty years I was a CDC scientist. I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us, particularly when we seem to be making progress. What will be the consequences? A health secretary who systematically ignores mention of the major killer of adult Americans is clearly not interested in research on what could account for a decrease in deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But among recent national initiatives, the push to increase availability of the opioid overdose antidote, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/05/16/why-everyone-should-learn-how-to-administer-naloxone/" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt; (brand name Narcan), has clearly played a role. Between 2021 and 2023, the number of naloxone doses dispensed from retail pharmacies doubled, &lt;a href="https://end-overdose-epidemic.org/highlights/ama-reports/2024-report/"&gt;and millions of additional doses were distributed by harm reduction organizations&lt;/a&gt;. Then in March 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray"&gt;over-the-counter distribution of a nasal spray version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, &lt;a href="https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/emergent-biosolutions-continues-broaden-access-awareness-and"&gt;20 million doses had been dispensed&lt;/a&gt;. The decline in overdose death rates started the month after the nasal spray became widely available. Temporal sequence is not causation, but in a public health crisis, a plausible step is mass distribution of an antidote easily administered by lay persons. Few interventions in medicine are more cost-effective than saving a life in ten seconds for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after being put in charge of the U.S. health care system in February 2025, Kennedy, called for &lt;a href="https://washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/02/trump-naloxone-overdose-funding-cuts"&gt;immediate decreased funding for naloxone&lt;/a&gt;. And he didn’t stop there. Slated for &lt;a href="https://fabbs.org/news/2025/04/hhs-budget-leaked-includes-nih-reorganization/"&gt;abolition is the National Institute for Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, the research group at the National Institutes of Health that helped develop the nasal version of naloxone. NIDA is currently researching opioid analgesics with lower addiction risk and developing wastewater detection systems to provide early warning of new illicit drugs. What is left of NIDA will be absorbed, with other decimated institutes, into a single entity focused on “behavioral health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the chopping block is the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hhs-addiction-mental-health-rfk-samsha-e83db20b4ef801971cd25d07eb41bcf9"&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which provides the major funding for state and local naloxone distribution and drug treatment programs. CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention, which is responsible for monitoring the drug epidemic, is marked for demolition too, despite having just reported the unprecedented reduction in overdose deaths. Adding to the threat of a renewed overdose explosion, the CDC issued the stark warning of a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7348a2.htm"&gt;seven-fold rise in overdoses from illicit carfentanil&lt;/a&gt;, an opioid 100 times more potent than fentanyl — so potent that the drug is used to sedate elephants and minuscule amounts can easily kill a person. Remnants of SAMHSA and the CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention will be folded into the new “Agency for Healthy America." Even if we assume that every cent of the budgets of the &lt;a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/samhsa-fy-2025-cj.pdf"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/budget-information/fiscal-year-2025-budget-information-congressional-justification-national-institute-drug-abuse"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/budget-funding/overdose-prevention-funding.html"&gt;drug control groups&lt;/a&gt; is eliminated, the total reduction in the &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/"&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; would be one-tenth of one percent, or considerably less than the cost of one &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/meet-the-navys-new-13-billion-aircraft-carrier/"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, these &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/05/20/federal-workers-trump-mental-health/"&gt;transformations&lt;/a&gt; should be done in a way to assure that the federal workforce will “be traumatically affected,” and “viewed as the villains.” What should the few remaining traumatically affected villains do about the drug crisis? Kennedy, who attributes his heroin recovery to 12-step abstinence, made that clear in his 2024 documentary: “We’re going to build hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/28/there-is-no-evidence-rfk-jrs-plan-for-healing-farms-somehow-helps-people-quit/" target="_blank"&gt;healing farms&lt;/a&gt;” — places where people with addiction “learn the discipline of hard work” and “get re-parented,” all the while bringing “a new industry to these forgotten corners of America.” Antidotes, treatment, prevention? These are at best irrelevant — more likely, a moral hazard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you learn in public health is that all victories are temporary. Back in 2000, the CDC group where I worked demonstrated that ongoing transmission of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; — the most infectious pathogen known to humankind — had been eliminated from the U.S., thanks to nationwide hard work to raise immunization levels. A quarter-century later, because of lowered immunization levels consequent to a torrent of vaccine misinformation by Kennedy and others, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,000 measles cases in 30 states&lt;/a&gt; over the first five months of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is now before Congress: If the agencies battling the drug epidemic are disabled, will a renewed explosion of deaths result? The last time the current president was in office, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"&gt;overdose rates rose more than 44%&lt;/a&gt; over the course of his tenure — the largest overdose increase in American history, with more than 300,000 lives lost. This time, we may never know if history is repeating itself since the systems that monitor overdose deaths are themselves subject to elimination. However, families of future overdose victims may still wonder if 2025 was the year we helped make Americans die again.&lt;/p&gt;

The variant, which was first discovered in China earlier this year, currently accounts for 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences tested from around the world, according to recent &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DU6FHVGHHZHBXCWXWEHF5PUEAQ"&gt;That’s a huge leap from 2.5% four weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LHCEUEY6UNH4BLTL6547VQNLII"&gt;A Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency is in regular contact with international partners about the activity of NB.1.8.1. Currently, only 20 NB.1.8.1 sequences have been identified in the US – which is below the threshold that’s needed for a variant to appear on &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance"&gt;the agency’s COVID dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FHM5BDMOFBSVABEKKXMQPJPAQ"&gt;The spokesperson even added that as soon as its prevalence increases, the new variant would show up on the tracker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HDB3IOZQQRBS5DF3UJKXR4XJ64"&gt;One important thing to note: according to infectious disease specialists, there are no alarming differences between the symptoms of NB.1.8.1 and those caused by other versions of SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OOGV6KR77FGXJP26OUUY27IDJI"&gt;“Currently, it appears that NB.1.8.1 would have similar symptoms to other COVID variants that have recently been circulating,” &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrix.com/find-care/doctors/hoy-zachary-1629399019" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy,&lt;/a&gt; a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="D2CZWWEWEJG6ZH7DKUR24RTXF4"&gt;Here’s what you should know about the newest COVID variant that’s making its rounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3QHAFMV4EFGLPMGT6EAQ6O3XRQ"&gt;Compared to the current variant that’s dominating the U.S., which is LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1has multiple new mutations on the spike protein that could enhance its ability to bind to our cells, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BBAI4LTNMNGPZD6SRUX4P5KSMM"&gt;These mutations could increase the virus’ transmissibility and potentially diminish the effectiveness of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/"&gt;neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that prevent pathogens from latching to our cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AP6QB73WMNHTFDEWIESR44JE5M"&gt;In simpler terms, the variant could be skilled at evading some of our defenses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WWGS54YCFBHVNJAE5DFWWXXFXU"&gt;When it comes to the signs and symptoms of the new variant, NB.1.8’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are the same as those seen with SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3XXGSVZJQBHKDFLYC4ZBMUFYQA"&gt;Two of COVID’s telltale symptoms are a mild, but persistent dry cough and nasal congestion.

The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the paper that the team initially thought the results were “too good to be true”, adding that they hoped the new nanoparticle design could be a “new pathway to an HIV cure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-51323"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we had to believe it.

&lt;p&gt;We all know stretching is good for us—that’s why it feels so good—but did you know that there are two types of stretch that have different benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretching involves holding a stretch and lengthening a muscle for an extended period of time, while dynamic stretching uses controlled and active movement to increase mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Jill Drummond, a NASM-certified Pilates instructor and personal trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bodybarpilates.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bodybarpilates.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BODYBAR Pilates&lt;/a&gt; to understand the differences, and Drummond shared a routine that combines both types to help you develop your overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a static stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Static stretching is what most people envision when they think of stretching—it involves holding a position for 30 to 60 seconds to target a specific muscle,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of stretching helps elongate muscles, increase range of motion and alleviate stiffness and soreness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretches are also great for increased blood flow, reduced muscle tension and stress, and enhanced relaxation and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a dynamic stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching, a fundamental component of Pilates, involves controlled, active movements that take joints and muscles through their full range of motion,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These movements mimic real-life activities, helping to improve mobility and overall joint function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic stretching contributes to improved blood circulation, reduced stiffness in muscles and joints, enhanced flexibility and mobility, better performance in daily activities and workouts and injury prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results, you should combine both static and dynamic stretches in your routine.

Gently pull your elbows back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder stretch: &lt;/strong&gt;Reach your right arm to the left across your body, place your left elbow under your right elbow and use your left forearm to gently pull your right arm into your chest. Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triceps stretch: &lt;/strong&gt;Raise your right arm and bend your elbow so your right hand is behind your head. Use your left hand to gently pull your elbow back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"global-development","tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","type":"Keyword","title":"Global development"},{"id":"global-development/global-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Global health"},{"id":"society/aids-and-hiv","type":"Keyword","title":"Aids and HIV"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/kat-lay","type":"Contributor","title":"Kat Lay"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/global-development","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Global Development"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/01/flu-cancer-hiv-after-covid-success-what-next-for-mrna-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;when it was used in vaccines&lt;/a&gt; made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Globally, there are &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost 40 million people&lt;/a&gt; living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study is laboratory based and was carried out in cells donated by HIV patients. The path to using the technology as part of a cure for patients is long, and would require successful tests in animals followed by safety trials in humans, likely to take years, before efficacy trials could even begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” stressed Cevaal. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Michael Roche of the University of Melbourne and co-senior author of the research, said the discovery could have broader implications beyond HIV, with the relevant white blood cells also involved in other diseases including cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirologist and emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the approach taken by the Melbourne team appeared be a major advance on existing strategies to force the virus out of hiding, but further studies would be needed to determine how best to kill it after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added: “Ultimately, one big unknown remains. Do you need to eliminate the entire reservoir for success or just the major part? If just 10% of the latent reservoir survives will that be sufficient to seed new infection? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, that does not detract from the significance of the current study, which represents a major potential advance in delivery of mRNA for therapeutic purposes to blood cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tomáš Hanke of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, disputed the idea that getting RNA into white blood cells had been a significant challenge. He said the hope that all cells in the body where HIV was hiding could be reached in this way was “merely a dream”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPYm45c0VSS3llblk1QU81MDhLT1RsTlpRYzUxYjFXc1FDSGlodlU0WE1IR21JSVFBalJTZldZS2tINEd2cTRfSlppM004a3RoWUJuU3REQXYyM090Um1TODc0OVZPYlE0cFVqeDlDcVluRS02aWlVbkhJbWhvWDcwNzI1b25hQXJySmlMY19tX2Y0dGNDeThXcHV4dG54VXRxRWliUWxqWlFsRFFUWU1mTy1weWVIemlJRkNTTHM5ZnFVdG8</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了这个“5-2-4 fartlek”步行锻炼一周—这是一个改变游戏规则的人-汤姆的指南 | I tried this '5-2-4 fartlek' walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPOS1NVTkxdFQwcWV4b0xONUNMZEZ4c2wyM3drTVdQNHFqZlJ3MjZfMnZhTTFuWmVJTGZsR3BaZGdHbVVkM25RS1Z5WDhqQUlmUVY3V0tBV09MbDIzSU5YY0JwbmtCQzRKZ3BkU0hyaE1aYnlDN0s4Q3BoemRTeHZiLVJELVR2Sk9GTml5NnhCTmNnUXU3NGJKOElPN3NxUGVrcEZaWFVpZ195UjZnLVNPNDl3aWdFX2t0SXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking workouts are all the rage at the moment — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; for your mental health, to the military-inspired &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer"&gt;rucking technique&lt;/a&gt; to build muscle. But one form of walking workout making headlines is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking Training&lt;/a&gt; (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure by alternating your pace. Unlike walking 10,000 steps, this science-based method raises your heart rate and boosts your cardiovascular fitness in less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an entirely new phenomenon, however. "Fartlek" walking has been around for a while, and translates to ‘speed play’ from the native Swedish. It’s all about varying the pace and difficulty throughout your walk, mixing intervals of faster-paced walks with slower rambles, allowing you to catch your breath. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that alternating periods of brisk and slow walking speeds can improve cardiovascular fitness, boost your overall fitness, and help control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen to give a new workout a try, I built my own fartlek walking session, and repeated it every morning for seven days. Read on to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-5-2-4-walking-workout-3"&gt;What is the 5-2-4 walking workout? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to get walking? Here’s the workout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm-up:&lt;/strong&gt; For me, this was a five-minute walk at a reasonable pace, but it might be some bodyweight exercises or stretching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Walking at a brisk pace, this is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Recovery walk at a slower pace. This should be a 4/10 effort max — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you, and your heart rate and breathing should return to normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat four times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the warm-up, this workout took me around 30 minutes every morning. I programmed the workout onto my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10 &lt;/a&gt;to avoid having to look at my wrist every few minutes — my watch would buzz when it was time to switch pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this workout is suitable for all levels, as you’re walking speed will be based on your exertion levels, if you’re new to fitness, or you’re returning to exercise following an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to speak to your doctor before taking on a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-tried-this-5-2-4-fartlek-walking-workout-for-a-week-and-it-s-a-game-changer-3"&gt;I tried this 5-2-4 fartlek walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s my verdict after a week of walking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-was-a-step-up-from-the-japanese-walking-method"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a step up from the Japanese walking method &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t tried it, the Japanese Interval Walking Training method involves three minutes at a low intensity, then three minutes walking at a high intensity for 30 minutes. This was a slight step up, as the high-intensity part of the workout was longer, and the recovery blocks were shorter. I found that I didn’t have long to catch my breath before I was picking up the pace again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally loved the extra challenge of walking at a brisk pace for five minutes. I thought about my walking technique — engaging my core so my abs were working, keeping my chest open and shoulders down, and swinging my arms as I moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to fartlek walking, or you’re getting back into fitness, it might be a good idea to try the three-minute intervals first and build up to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-got-a-lot-done-in-30-minutes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I got a lot done in 30 minutes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all working parents will appreciate, I have a lot to juggle, and despite writing about fitness for a living, sometimes it’s my workouts that suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite only being 30 minutes long, I felt like I’d worked hard with this interval walk. I’d raised my heart rate higher than I would typically do on a dog walk, and I’ve found interval walking is a great option for those who want to reap the benefits of walking, without the time to take a longer stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can help improve your overall fitness, build muscle, strengthen your bones and joints, and help boost your mood and lower stress. You’ll also burn more calories doing a fartlek walk than you typically would walking at the same pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking"&gt;walking for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, remember the key is to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One of the easiest ways to keep an eye on your pace, heart rate, and calorie burn is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-m-still-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m still hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was instantly hooked after a week of the Japanese walking method, and I equally enjoyed this fartlek workout. As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also helped me de-stress and boost my mood, plus, it gave me the excuse to take a break from my laptop and spend 30 minutes outdoors in nature — something we should all do more of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park or even on the treadmill at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the joy of fartlek is the freedom to play with your pace — if structured intervals feel too much, just walk faster for two blocks, then slower for a block, or use street lights as your markers. However fast or slow you walk, you’re getting fitter and healthier with every step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A woman in Texas has died from a rare brain infection after flushing her nose with water stored in the tank of a recreational vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab tests on the 71-year-old woman's cerebrospinal fluid confirmed she was infected with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegleria_fowleri"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt; fowleri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny, free-swimming &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"&gt;protozoan&lt;/a&gt; also dubbed 'the brain-eating amoeba,' which causes the highly lethal disease &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegleriasis"&gt;primary amoebic meningoencephalitis&lt;/a&gt; (PAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This killer bug hangs out in warm bodies of fresh water like ponds, lakes, and even neglected swimming pools. Most infections occur while swimming or engaging in water sports in these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using non-boiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the four days before illness onset," a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;CDC case report&lt;/a&gt; details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died eight days after symptom onset."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities were unable to detect the amoeba in samples from the RV tank or the campground water supply, which may be because they took samples 23 days after the possible exposure took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But testing did indicate the water had inadequate levels of disinfectant to prevent microbes from building biofilm communities that can protect pathogens like &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri. &lt;/em&gt;The water was more cloudy than what is recommended for drinking water, another sign that disinfectant levels may have been inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you really shouldn't flush tap (or RV tank) water up your nose for nasal irrigation: the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/prevention/sinus-rinsing.html"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; only distilled or sterilized water be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because while &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; likes things lukewarm, it &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;loves hotter liquids: the kinds sloshing around inside our bodies, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it enters a human body, &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri &lt;/em&gt;passes a temperature threshold – about 25 degrees Celsius or 77 degrees Fahrenheit – that transforms the bug from its flagellate state into an insatiable &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophozoite"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophozoite"&gt;rophozoite&lt;/a&gt;, a form in which the microbe is actively feeding and reproducing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other entryway to the body, and &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; will be politely escorted out by our immune system or burned up by stomach acids. But via the nose, it has an alarmingly straightforward route to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This ravenous pathogen chews through the membrane we use to smell with, the olfactory epithelium, and follows the nerve fibers that carry scent signals back to our brains, nibbling at astrocytes and neurons along the way until it reaches its cerebral target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163765" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-642x425.jpeg" alt="US Woman Dies From Brain-Eating Amoeba After Flushing Sinuses With RV Water" class="size-medium wp-image-163765" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-642x425.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-627x415.jpeg 627w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-768x508.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-1536x1017.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-2048x1356.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-600x397.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163765" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Direct fluorescent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="163623" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; stain showing amebic meningoencephalitis due to &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;While this disease is very rare, the prognosis is dire: of the 164 cases reported in the US between 1962 and 2023, only 4 people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use of nasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards," the report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full CDC report is available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; issued an unusual statement Wednesday regarding a sperm donor who carried a rare genetic mutation that increases the risk of cancer among offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged offspring in their forties and fifties who were born from sperm donations in private clinics in the central region to go directly to one of the genetic institutes across the country for testing as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case began several months ago when the family of a deceased sperm donor informed the Health Ministry that he had Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of developing various cancers, including colon, uterus, stomach, ovaries, and other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deceased had donated sperm at private fertility clinics in central Israel between 1974 and 1985, before regulated sperm banks were established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how many children were born from his donations, but the Health Ministry estimates it could be dozens, or even over a hundred. The offspring themselves do not know who the sperm donor is, but it is known that he donated only at private clinics in the central region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt; The program is part of a national effort to alleviate the Israeli doctor shortage. (Illustrative). (credit: INGIMAGE)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Ministry, the risk of carrying the mutation among children born from these sperm samples is 50 percent. For carriers, there is now a structured medical surveillance program designed to detect cancer at an early stage and thereby save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry called on women and families who received sperm donations during those years in private clinics in the central region to inform their offspring and recommend that they contact one of the 10 genetic institutes across the country directly to check for the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No referral from a doctor is needed, and one can approach directly. The test is not covered by insurance and costs 633 shekels. Those who are found to be carriers will be eligible for full medical treatment, including early detection tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Talia Eldar-Geva, head of the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/fertility"&gt;Fertility&lt;/a&gt; and Reproduction Department at the Health Ministry, said: “We are aware of the complexity of the situation, especially given that some families who received sperm donations 40-50 years ago may have hidden the fact from their offspring, and may now decide to reveal the ‘secret’ only because of this incident. But since detecting the carrier status and then performing all the early detection tests can lead to early diagnosis, early treatment, reduced risk of illness, and sometimes even save lives — the Health Ministry feels obligated to address this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli case joins a series of troubling incidents reported in recent years in Europe and the United States, where sperm donors carried rare genetic mutations that were passed on to their offspring, sometimes without them ever knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the recent European Genetics Conference in Milan, a case was presented of a sperm donor from Europe found to be a carrier of Li-Fraumeni syndrome — a very serious genetic condition that causes a high risk of early-onset cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and brain cancer. That donor fathered at least 67 children in eight different countries, ten of whom have already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation in that case affects the TP53 gene, known as the “guardian of the genome” due to its role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/dna"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage. At the time of donation in the early 2000s, the mutation was not yet recognized as a clear risk factor. But today, with advances in genetic testing, it has been identified as a particularly dangerous mutation, and the lab in France that received the samples determined unequivocally that it is cancer-causing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, all the offspring were referred for genetic testing and regular medical supervision. Ten of them have already been diagnosed with cancer, and 23 others were found to be carriers of the mutation. Medical recommendations include regular MRI scans, breast and abdominal checks, and sometimes even periodic blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A drug used to relieve the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397"&gt;debilitating symptoms of menopause&lt;/a&gt; may also be reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-is-rising-in-young-american-women-and-we-dont-know-why"&gt;invasive breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; by Northwestern University suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 60,000 women a year are diagnosed with a &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/dcis-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ/"&gt;contained form of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; that can indicate a higher risk of developing invasive tumors later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-invasive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is typically detected during routine mammograms, accounts for up to 25 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses, and has a 98 percent recovery rate after 10 years when removed by surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to increase their chance of remaining cancer-free many patients also undergo treatments like radiation and hormone therapy following surgery. These treatments often have debilitating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojddACFfVa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02694809"&gt;The phase two clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; recruited 141 postmenopausal women who have a form of contained breast cancer called &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/dcis-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ/"&gt;ductal carcinoma tumors&lt;/a&gt;. Half of them were given a medication for managing symptoms of menopause called Duavee; others were administered a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; for the month between diagnosis and breast cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duavee is composed of estrogen hormones and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazedoxifene"&gt;bazedoxifene&lt;/a&gt; – a molecule that either promotes or dampens the use of estrogens in the body, depending on the type of tissue it is in. This estrogen receptor modifier is also used to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2019.1615882"&gt;help treat osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who took the drug had notably less cell growth in their breast tissue by their surgery date. &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/2025-asco-annual-meeting/16337?presentation=243651#243651"&gt;There was also&lt;/a&gt; "no impact on quality of life compared to placebo."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What excites me most is that a medication designed to help women feel better during menopause may also reduce their risk of invasive breast cancer," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/05/menopause-drug-duavee-may-help-prevent-invasive-breast-cancer-clinical-trial-finds/?fj=1"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University surgeon Swati Kulkarni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163364" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI.jpg" alt="Rounded clumps outlined in green with blue clusters withing." class="wp-image-163364 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI-364x415.jpg 364w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163364" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Breast cancer cells highlighted in green cell surface protein markers and DNA in blue. (&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/biology"&gt;Tom Misteli/Karen Meaburn/&lt;/a&gt;NCI)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, trial participants taking Duavee did not experience the intolerable side effects associated with other cancer drugs. Rather, it tends to increase the quality of life in people already struggling with menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While larger studies are still needed to confirm Duavee's ability to prevent breast cancer, Kulkarni and team suggest that, for now, those with elevated risk for breast cancer as well as menopausal symptoms would most likely benefit from Duavee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially given women with prior cancer lesions can't resort to hormone treatments to ease their menopause symptoms because they can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(19)31709-x"&gt;increase the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support consideration that [Duavee] is a safe option to manage menopausal symptoms for women concerned about their risk of developing breast cancer, and provide supportive evidence that [Duavee] may reduce the risk of developing invasive breast cancer," the researchers &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/2025-asco-annual-meeting/16337?presentation=243651"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; in their conference abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial results have yet to be published but were presented at the &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/2025-asco-annual-meeting/16337?presentation=243651"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology's&lt;/a&gt; latest annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We recommend that anyone 6 months or older who has not received their 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine get it now,” Santora said Wednesday. “It’s possible that by this fall there will be limited access to vaccines due to evolving policies at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santora’s recommendation comes after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on May 27, in a 58-second video clip on the social media site X, that the CDC would no longer be recommending the COVID vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A statement like that creates confusion and undermines trust in vaccine safety and efficacy,” Santora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, a committee within the CDC, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), makes recommendations to the CDC director about who should receive vaccines. The director nearly always follows their guidance. The CDC currently has no director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy has sidestepped that,” the health officer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the CDC hadn’t amended its online recommendation that healthy children 6 months to 17 years old be administered the vaccine. The change, however, came Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They just changed the CDC website,” Santora said. “Wow, that is in real time. Now they say routine vaccines are only recommended for individuals 18 years and older who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Under the new guidance, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccinations, if parents’ decisions are “informed by the clinical judgment of a health care provider.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Kennedy’s pronouncement that the vaccines would no longer be recommended for pregnant women, Santora said, “Again, Kennedy is not following the standard process and procedures within the CDC. In the CDC guidance, pregnancy is identified as a risk factor. So pregnancy would be considered a condition that would make someone eligible for COVID vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a prominent member of the ACIP, resigned from the committee on Tuesday in protest. Santora said Panagiotakopoulos presented data showing that unvaccinated pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are more likely to require hospitalization and that their babies’ health suffers as well. From birth to 6 months, infants are believed to face a risk of hospitalization comparable to adults ages 65 to 74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a strong recommendation that pregnant women do get vaccinated because it provides protection to the infant,” Santora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health officer said the public’s choice regarding vaccination may also be limited by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA authorizes updated versions of the vaccine developed to better match the latest COVID-19 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santora said the Moderna vaccine developed for use this fall has been approved by the FDA only for individuals 12 years and older. Dr. Martin Makary, who heads the FDA, appeared together with Kennedy in the May 27 video clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santora said the changes in the CDC recommendation and the FDA authorization could affect the willingness of insurance companies to pay for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Santora said low-income Marin residents must go to local pharmacies to receive their vaccinations following reductions in federal funding for purchase of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools do not require that children get vaccinated for COVID-19. Nevertheless, Santora is concerned that Kennedy, a vocal vaccine skeptic, may push for reduced use of vaccinations for other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RFK and his colleagues have been very clear about believing that children are receiving more vaccines than they should be receiving,” Santora said. “This may mark the beginning of major changes in federal policies that could affect access to childhood vaccines that have significantly reduced hospitalizations and mortality from vaccine preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santora said that testing of Marin County wastewater indicates that the presence of COVID-19 in the county is currently low. During the week ending May 24, there were two COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Marin County. The last surge of COVID-19 cases in Marin came in August 2024. Currently about 31% of the county’s residents are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a delightful six months,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California at Berkeley. “We can’t be very sure about what this virus is going to do, but there are very good infectious disease epidemiologists who argue that we will see a summer surge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Santora: “People forget until they get sick with it. They underestimate their risk. Based on previous patterns I expect to see an increase in infections.”&lt;/p&gt;

But you don't have to simply incorporate it into your nighttime routine: Vitamin A is available in your diet, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet plays a significant role in our skin’s health and appearance,” says Manhattan-based board-certified dermatologist &lt;a data-offer-url="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.drdendyengelman.com/"}' href="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dendy Engelman, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;. “There are studies to support that increased vitamin intake helps skin in both the aging space and acne.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how you can take advantage of vitamin A in your diet to improve your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin (more on that later) that is key for a healthy body. “The human body does not produce vitamin A, so it must be obtained externally through our diet and skincare,” Dr. Engelman says. “Retinol, like other retinoids, is a derivative of vitamin A. When applied topically to the skin, it is converted to retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the edible form, vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, which is found in foods that originate from animals, and carotenoids, which are derived from plant-based foods and converted into vitamin A when digested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Appropriate vitamin A intake helps support healthy skin, hair, and nails,” Dr. Engelman adds. “Vitamin A plays a role in regulating sebum production and cell turnover, which are important for maintaining a healthy skin barrier (including the scalp) and supporting the hair growth cycle. Vitamin A is also necessary for the synthesis of keratin, which is a vital structural protein for both hair and nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily requirement of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily vitamin A requirements vary depending on age, sex, and health conditions (if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, that changes it, too). According to the Mayo Clinic, adult males should take 900 micrograms (mcg) and adult women should take 700 mcg. It is important to note that the body does not need large amounts of vitamin A every day, but regular, balanced intake is essential to maintain the right balance and prevent deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A warning about vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that consuming too much vitamin A can actually be very toxic for the human body, leading to a condition known as ‘hypervitaminosis A,’” adds Dr. Engelman. “This can result in a number of unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects—including, ironically, a disrupted and unhealthy skin barrier, and hair loss. Therefore, it is very important to avoid excessive consumption of vitamin A (or any compound!) and speak with your doctor to determine the diet that’s best for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15 vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of liver (especially beef or chicken), which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 cup of fortified dairy products like milk, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;185 mcgs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup cantaloupe, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;135 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 large hard-boiled egg, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;75 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of salmon, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;60 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw carrots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;460 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup spinach, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;570 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw red peppers, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;120 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato with skin, which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;chard, roughly &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1"}' href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 dried sulfured apricots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;65 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;peaches, roughly &lt;a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/sshw/message/message.php?p=Health&amp;amp;m=301" target="_blank"&gt;24 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 whole mango, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;115 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1vNm5mei1FblZVRmRHTk54bEI2emFWZ0UtLXl5eHpOeGkzQ2VtQkI3YklHb0tnUXhVbG5hVkVsb08tV0ltT1haREJfcUFrYUFpNklwYlI3cWljX25T</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么蚊子比其他人更能叮咬某些人的原因- BuzzFeed | So THAT'S Why Mosquitoes Bite Some People More Than Others - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBVck1MUnFfN0ZtUzZmQmVMblQ4NmhCZHAtUEM4bjRHOGM3Q3ZBdkhRazhqMWRBV0FtUlR2N0gyczdlbVlHVWFhX05iLW41ZVNuTjVKdmdETjRUZlU0VnlQU3JUdGxsM284VEpYMlRPNUZ6ckhTNmE2TA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At only 14 years old, Siddarth Nandyala has created a heart disease detection app that can identify early signs of cardiovascular issues in seconds. The app is called Circadian AI, and it could be a powerful tool for early intervention, especially in regions where access to healthcare is limited.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being the leading cause of death worldwide, early symptoms for heart disease often go unnoticed. That’s because diagnosis depends on invasive tests, advanced imaging, or costly procedures that are not accessible to everyone. And this delay can be fatal, as many individuals discover their condition only after a stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Nandyala set out to solve this problem by developing a non-invasive, affordable way to screen for heart abnormalities before serious complications arise. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;According to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.circadian-ai.com/"&gt;Circadian AI&lt;/a&gt; uses the microphone on your smartphone to record a user’s heartbeat. The sound is then cleaned up using advanced noise-cancellation, and analyzed in the cloud using a machine learning model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, the app identifies patterns linked to arrhythmia, heart valve issues, early signs of heart failure, or coronary artery disease. The interface presents users with a summary that highlights any abnormalities and encourages further testing when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;p class="signup-form-tos"&gt;By signing up, I agree to the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and have reviewed the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a full-fledged replacement for medical devices like ECGs, of course. But it does provide an effective pre-screening tool for early awareness. And, the app has already been tested in clinical settings. Trials in the United States involved approximately 15,000 participants, while additional testing in India included around 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the simple app detected signs of heart disease with over 96% accuracy. Results were later confirmed through traditional diagnostic methods. For now, the app is limited to trained professionals as it undergoes regulatory review and clinical validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nandyala is already working on expanding the heart disease detection app to pick up on lung-related illnesses like pneumonia and pulmonary embolism using similar sound analysis. This is just one more way AI has helped us find new ways to detect deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think about the rise of artificial intelligence, one thing is clear: AI in medicine can be handy. From &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/crazy-new-ai-can-tell-if-youre-sick-just-by-looking-at-your-tongue/"&gt;AI-powered doctors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/doctors-left-a-sick-man-for-dead-but-then-ai-saved-his-life/"&gt;AI that saves lives&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of ways we can put automated systems to work and make life for both doctors and patients easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates can be part of a nourishing and balanced eating pattern. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategically choosing carbs that are higher in fiber and nutrients and lower in added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other habits like staying hydrated and being consistent can help support your nutrient needs more than totally avoiding any food group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbohydrates-8423291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, or carbs, have gotten a bad reputation over the years, often demonized in popular diet trends and wellness influencers. However, the truth about carbohydrates is far more nuanced than what you'll see on social media or hear from the latest fad diet gurus. Cutting carbs drastically may offer temporary results, but for many people, this approach isn’t sustainable. Plus, cutting carbs may result in nutritional gaps or other undesirable outcomes. Can a low-carb diet be beneficial for certain people? Absolutely. But it’s not for everyone. Instead of seeing carbs as the enemy, it’s time to take a more balanced approach that fosters a positive relationship with food and keeps your body functioning at its best.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs are one of the primary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291112/what-macros-are-right-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;macronutrients&lt;/a&gt;, alongside fats and proteins. They serve as a major energy source for the body, particularly for the brain and muscles. Carbs are often broken down into glucose, which fuels everything from your daily activities to intense workouts. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Complex carbs&lt;/a&gt;, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, also come packed with essential vitamins, fiber and other nutrients that your body needs to thrive. Restricting carbs, or completely cutting out certain nutrient-dense carbs, means you could miss out on key nutrients and energy your body needs to function properly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Restricting carbs might seem appealing at first, especially given that low-carb diets like keto or Atkins are often touted for their rapid results. But here’s the catch! What works in the short term may fail when it comes to long-term wellness. Here’s why.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Many carb-rich foods like starchy vegetables, whole grains, fruits and legumes are also extremely nutrient dense,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.feedyourzest.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;McKenzie Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.feedyourzest.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, M.P.H., RDN.&lt;/a&gt; “Cutting carbs can result in inadequate intake of important nutrients and food compounds including folate, antioxidants and fiber,” McKenzie added. A 2025 study shows that low-carb diets are linked to deficiencies of micronutrients like vitamin C, iron and magnesium, which may result in negative implications in the long run.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study published in 2022 looked at the eating habits of 307 U.S. adults who followed a low-carbohydrate diet and compared what these individuals are to the daily nutritional goals outlined in the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The study found that people on low-carb diets were consuming too much saturated fat, total fats, and sodium. At the same time, they weren’t getting enough fiber, magnesium, potassium and several important vitamins like A, E, D and, in some cases, C and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One reason why cutting carbs can backfire is because it often leads to low energy,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Carbohydrates are your body’s preferred fuel source, especially for your brain and muscles, so when you drastically reduce your intake, you might feel sluggish, irritable or find it harder to concentrate,” DeVito explained.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simple carbohydrates, often found in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/added-sugar-drinks-study-8760752" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-added-sugar foods&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to energy crashes and have been linked to poorer brain health and reduced cognitive performance over time. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates, like those found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, provide a steady, long-lasting source of energy and have been associated with improved memory and better brain health as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the biggest reasons cutting carbs backfires is the sheer difficulty of maintaining such a restrictive diet. Eventually, most people revert to their previous eating patterns, often feeling like they’ve “failed.” This cycle of deprivation and overindulgence can harm not just your physical health but also your mental well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cutting carbs completely can seem effective at first, but it often leads to burnout; not because people lack discipline, but because it’s logistically and socially unrealistic,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Carbs are part of most meals, cultures and shared experiences. When they’re demonized or off-limits, it can create an ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset, which makes people feel like they’ve failed if they have even a small amount,” she explained. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cultural, religious and economic barriers pose unique challenges to achieving nutritional compliance with low carbohydrate diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Rigidity fuels guilt, yo-yo dieting, and ultimately, a strained relationship with food. Sustainable progress comes from flexibility and learning how to include the right kinds of carbs (understanding complex vs simple carbohydrates), not avoid them altogether,” Katz explained.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “By cutting carbs, you could be compromising on your gut health,” explained &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Fiber, which is critical for a healthy gut, is a type of carbohydrate.  90% of people are already not meeting their fiber recommendations so by cutting carbs you could also be making it harder to reach your fiber goals,” she explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you were to cut carbs then you might notice an increase in constipation and it could result in gut microbiome changes,” Sauceda added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing your carbs, it’s important to choose the right ones. Eating high-quality carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits and vegetables is linked to a 33.7% lower risk of constipation. On the flip side, consuming less nutritious carbs like high-added-sugar snacks and refined grains increased constipation risk by 83.4% in an analysis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If cutting carbs isn’t the answer, what’s the alternative? The good news is that you don’t have to totally avoid carbohydrates to feel your best. Instead, focus on incorporating a balanced, sustainable approach to eating that works for you personally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Quality Over Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;: Not all carbs are created equal. Refined carbs, like white bread and high-added-sugar drinks, are stripped of certain nutrients and may cause blood sugar spikes. On the other hand, complex carbs, like whole grains, sweet potatoes and brown rice, are a natural source of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Focus on adding these nutrient-dense options to your meals rather than avoiding carbs altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Meals Balanced&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of fixating on cutting out a particular food group, aim to create balanced meals that include protein, healthy fats and carbohydrates. For instance, pair whole-grain pasta with lean protein like chicken or plant-based options, plus some olive oil and a handful of veggies. This approach ensures you’re fueling your body with what it truly needs without feeling deprived.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Consistency Over Perfection:&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than aiming to eat “perfectly,” focus on consistent habits that support your overall well-being. That might mean having oatmeal for breakfast most days while occasionally enjoying a donut when the mood strikes. Balance is key. There’s no need to label foods as “good” or “bad”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active and Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Physical activity and hydration are essential compliments to your nutrition. Exercise helps regulate blood sugar and supports gut health, while drinking enough water can help keep gut health in-check too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are not the villain they’ve been made out to be. Your body needs them to function properly and to feel its best. Cutting carbs may offer short-term results, but it often leads to long-term frustration, fatigue and health challenges. By focusing on balance, variety, and listening to your body, you can create a way of eating that nourishes and sustains you over the long haul.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, eating is not about perfection; it’s about supporting your life in a way that feels good and works for you. The right carbs included!

Anyone present in the building (or in any business located within the building) during certain hours is considered likely to have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CCHD said on Wednesday that a person from Hill County came to Great Falls for an appointment on Tuesday, May 27, at Prospect Heights Medical Center (in the vicinity of the 1400 block of Fourth Street South).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the person began experiencing symptoms of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail Hill, the health officer for Cascade County, explained, "Because measles is airborne, because it entered that building, the entire building is considered exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HILL TALKS ABOUT MEASLES EXPOSURE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services says says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of exposure locations associated with the person's visit in Great Falls includes Central Montana Orthopedic Specialists, Sun River Health, Atlas Neurology, the office of Dr. Susan Avery, Quest Diagnostics, and Northwest Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CCHD GUIDANCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may have been exposed but do not receive notice from CCHD within the following several days, you may contact CCHD at 406-791-9242 for directions. Exposed individuals with presumed immunity (see below) do not need to quarantine but should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure; individuals who do not have presumed immunity are advised to stay home for 21 days and monitor for symptoms. Anyone exposed to measles should also talk to their healthcare provider to understand their individual risk of measles and should consider postponing routine medical care at least 21 days from their last exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first symptoms of measles usually appear about 7-14 days after exposure: fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and/or white spots in the mouth. A red rash—usually beginning near the hairline and moving downward—typically begins about 2-3 days after the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, you should continue to stay home except for testing or urgent/emergency treatment. Please call Benefis Health System at 406-731-8300 to arrange for testing or urgent care. It is extremely important that you do not enter a clinic building without calling ahead to the clinic so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are presumed to have immunity to measles if you: have written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); OR laboratory evidence of immunity; OR laboratory confirmation of disease; OR were born before 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of your vaccination status, call CCHD at 406-791-9242 to check your Montana electronic vaccine records and/or for direction on other ways to obtain your records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/CCHDmeasles"&gt;click here to visit&lt;/a&gt; the CCHD website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEASLES IN MONTANA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all 17 cases of measles in the state are Montana residents, and newly-identified cases are isolating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 cases have been reported in four counties in Montana: 10 in Gallatin; three in Hill; two in Flathead; and two in Yellowstone. Two of the cases required hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five cases of measles were reported in Gallatin County in April 2025 - the first confirmed measles cases in Montana since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/4dHKSlc"&gt;Hill County&lt;/a&gt;, the three cases were all unvaccinated children, and all were reported in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yellowstone County cases were an adult and a child — both unvaccinated — who became ill while traveling outside of the country. Those cases were confirmed this week by the Yellowstone County health agency, who said that the two cases had fully recovered and were no longer contagious by the time they returned to Yellowstone County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No details have been released about the two cases in Flathead County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABOUT MEASLES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the DPHHS &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MeaslesDPHHS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPHHS also says that measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected. The agency says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles to others even before he or she develops symptoms—from four days before they develop the measles rash through four days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACROSS THE U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of May, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 1,088 cases spread across 33 states, including Montana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s up from just 285 confirmed cases of measles last year and is the highest number of measles cases our country has seen in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst of the outbreaks has been in the South Plains region of Texas, where more than 600 cases have been reported, most in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that you have measles or may have been exposed to someone with measles, please contact your &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MontanaHealthAgencies"&gt;county or tribal health department&lt;/a&gt; or primary care provider before seeking care, if safe to do so, for instructions about how to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek, known scientifically as &lt;em&gt;Trigonella foenum-graecum&lt;/em&gt;, has long been valued for its dense nutritional content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains a notable amount of protein, fiber, and magnesium that can help meet daily needs without complicated meal planning. Many traditions have used these seeds for their subtle taste and nourishing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-5004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Muhammad H. Alu’datt&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of a recent study on fenugreek and its impact on human health, noted that fenugreek offers a unique combination of macronutrients and minerals that support daily health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that the seeds are especially rich in protein, magnesium, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-chia-seed-packs-a-powerful-nutrient-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which can aid in muscle maintenance, blood sugar control, and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-uses-of-fenugreek-seeds"&gt;Early uses of fenugreek seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek’s history crosses &lt;a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/trigonella-foenum-graecum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;multiple cultures&lt;/a&gt;. Some groups enjoy it as a cooking spice, while others appreciate its practical uses in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, its popularity is growing because newer &lt;a href="https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/glycemic-index-lowering-effects-of-defatted-fenugreek-seed-flakes-fenuflakestm-on-some-indian-food-preparations-a-randomized-controlled-clinical-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest these seeds might promote healthy muscle upkeep. One reason is the protein content, which helps maintain tissues vital for movement or exercise recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; intake is just as important for anyone trying to stay active. Fenugreek seeds offer this mineral in amounts that make it easier to reach the recommended daily target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have associated magnesium with basic metabolic reactions and muscle relaxation. This connection means that those who include fenugreek in their diets might notice fewer nagging muscle strains during busy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fenugreek-packs-a-nutritional-punch"&gt;Fenugreek packs a nutritional punch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek has more than protein and magnesium. The first mention of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/galactomannan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;galactomannan&lt;/a&gt; in fenugreek highlights the presence of a type of soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This component seems to support a balanced digestive system by regulating intestinal movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the seeds also provide additional minerals, like iron and potassium, though &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/magnesium-threonate-is-best-supplement-for-improving-brain-health-says-neurologist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; often takes the spotlight for its role in muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some find fenugreek seeds a bit chewy and slightly aromatic, especially when lightly crushed. Toasting them in a dry pan helps soften their sharper notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who prefer milder textures can soak them overnight and blend them into dips for an easy way to boost daily protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-support-and-normal-digestion"&gt;Muscle support and normal digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet with plenty of protein often supports muscle tissue. Fenugreek participates as an excellent plant-based source that contains amino acids, which may aid in muscle repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dealing with a hectic schedule can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/"&gt;toss &lt;/a&gt;these seeds into rice dishes or soups. Substituting other condiments with crushed fenugreek seeds may enhance taste and add a nutrient advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber in fenugreek seeds also promotes satiety, which can help manage portion sizes. Combined with water, certain components in these seeds expand and encourage a feeling of comfortable fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calmer digestive experience often follows, because fiber is &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.906690/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a steady glycemic response as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is more stable energy, which comes in handy for maintaining an active routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-pointers-for-using-fenugreek"&gt;Everyday pointers for using fenugreek&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground fenugreek powder goes well with marinades or rubs on lean meat. It can also flavor vegetarian stews, giving them a subtle, savory edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prefer a cooled fenugreek “&lt;a href="https://fullleafteacompany.com/pages/what-is-fenugreek-tea-history-benefits-more?srsltid=AfmBOopmdXsVkS1d6fw4b7tTWDF-z15ud4uWYDuOdHXPFxNPH_ZWKWgt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;,” steeped briefly to highlight its mild, nutty essence. Others go for fenugreek sprouts in salads or sandwiches, which add an extra crunch packed with vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alu’datt and colleagues emphasized that moderate daily intake of fenugreek can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/klotho-s-kl-protein-discovered-boosts-lifespan-muscle-brain-power-with-one-dose/"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; support and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended consistent use in small amounts, but cautioned that guidance from a health professional is essential before introducing new ingredients into a regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nursing-mothers-and-fenugreek-seeds"&gt;Nursing mothers and fenugreek seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek may also help women during breastfeeding. In a clinical trial with 78 nursing mothers, those who consumed fenugreek seed tea reported increased milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies in that group showed improved growth in weight, length, and head circumference compared to those in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seed may also play a role in blood sugar balance. Another recent &lt;a href="https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/glycemic-index-lowering-effects-of-defatted-fenugreek-seed-flakes-fenuflakestm-on-some-indian-food-preparations-a-randomized-controlled-clinical-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 62 people with type 2 diabetes showed that taking fenugreek powder twice daily for two months led to reduced blood glucose and body mass index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this effect comes from the seed’s high &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002136.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which can slow sugar absorption and blunt post-meal spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improves-well-being"&gt;Improves well-being&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent bloating or other digestive troubles motivate many individuals to look for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-foods-promote-weight-loss-regardless-of-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant foods&lt;/a&gt; that are less burdensome. Fenugreek’s soluble fiber might soothe common issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can support the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87559120600586315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiota&lt;/a&gt; that line the gut, which may encourage both nutrient absorption and comfort after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many simply appreciate how fenugreek offers variety in the kitchen. Livening up everyday staples with an extra layer of flavor encourages healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds might also suit those exploring legume-based diets, since fenugreek belongs to the same family as lentils and beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sensible-measures-and-professional-advice"&gt;Sensible measures and professional advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults often do well with moderate amounts of fenugreek, but cautious steps are wise for some. If individuals have special conditions, it’s good to speak with a dietitian or physician before altering meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most find no problems when integrating fenugreek into a varied diet. A steady intake of these seeds can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archaeologists-find-hallucinogenic-seeds-in-ancient-bones-black-henbane/"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; a plan that includes quality proteins, vegetables, and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and those who train regularly sometimes find fenugreek beneficial due to its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-high-protein-fruit-prunes-strengthens-muscles-and-bones-in-people-over-45/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high protein&lt;/a&gt; content. It’s considered a simple way to refuel muscles without an abrupt shift in meal routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding water-rich vegetables with fenugreek seeds can also enhance hydration, which is valuable during intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.16970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 23:10:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQSjRjN282ZDZjRGdfRVVmbTFhYmcxamhmMDQxMFNsVm9kWEJ0c01Ka3dCbE94UWVJeFZ6WldIUkRPa0tNcGZUYWtzVG9GOUZJUlEtMElyREVERE1HMHRKZWY3UngtblZOejBJaXVKTTd2MWZBNVFvVzB0S3ptZmg3dndDd1JleU1OLWkzUmNEZV91TzhjdlVucHFfRQ</guid></item><item><title>一种食品注册营养师认为不如大多数人想象的那么健康-雅虎 | The One Food Registered Dietitians Say Isn’t as Healthy as Most People Think - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNXzYyb0JJTUhLSFBCdnctUjVaYlcxZnNWV2l0MG1obGdVd3p6T3hlclRVbXhCODhVTFF0alMwanVydnRiVWV3UW9CeTdwTnJPSU9xOG5pRzZFSDNaWWluX004amVGTDY3bnVCQmRQSjhzTzhfNTFZUWNmVHJNQkNUY1FiYTdweVR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/food-that-isnt-as-healthy-as-people-think-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Food Registered Dietitians Say Isn’t as Healthy as Most People Think;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The One Food Registered Dietitians Say Isn’t as Healthy as Most People Think&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One food that’s long had a health halo is &lt;a href="https://parade.com/29100/janemichaelstern/granola/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:granola;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;granola&lt;/a&gt;.

Why is this such a big deal? &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in added sugar is linked to a slew of health problems, including a higher risk of heart disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer and cognitive decline—all the exact opposite of what you want if you're choosing a snack with health in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldsmith says that other unhealthy ingredients often found in granola are coconut oil and palm oil, both of which are high in saturated fat. This is a red flag because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some scientific studies have shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;some scientific studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that saturated fat can negatively impact cardiovascular health. If the granola is made with nut butter, she says it often contains these unhealthy oils. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/know-bread-healthier-others-healthiest-102500427.html" data-ylk="slk:We All Know Some Bread Is Healthier Than Others—But Which Is the Healthiest?

Its fiber content in particular can help to support gut motility and control blood sugar levels,” Marin explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When shopping for granola, Marin suggests looking at the nutritional panel and checking the fiber and protein content. “I recommend opting for a granola with a high fiber content that contains ingredients like oats, nuts and seeds for added protein,” she says. Goldsmith recommends this too, saying that she favors granola with eight or more grams of fiber per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/5-sneaky-ways-adding-more-202500321.html" data-ylk="slk:5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; 5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While you’re looking at the nutritional panel, both dietitians say to check to see how much added sugar and saturated fat is in the granola you’re considering buying. If it has more than eight grams of added sugar, Goldsmith recommends putting it back on the shelf. In terms of saturated fat, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limiting it to less than 6% of overall calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Besides the nutritional panel, both dietitians say to check out the ingredients list. Goldsmith recommends choosing a granola made with whole grains, nuts, seeds and fruits. As for what you don’t want to see listed, ​Marin says to steer clear of granola that contains stabilizers, emulsifiers or artificial coloring—all of which can negatively impact gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/healthy-habit-thats-taking-years-102500219.html" data-ylk="slk:The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life, According to Longevity Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life, According to Longevity Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are having trouble finding a healthy granola option at the store, it’s easy to make your own,” Marin says. She recommends using olive oil instead of coconut oil or palm oil because it's a good source of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“To naturally sweeten it, use date powder, date syrup or minimal maple syrup and air fry for more crunch with less added fat. If you choose to add dried fruit to your granola, choose one with no added sugar,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even when granola only contains nutrient-rich, healthy ingredients, Goldsmith says portion control is important because the calories and fat content can quickly add up. If you find yourself needing to eat a lot of granola to feel satisfied, she recommends upping the protein and fiber content in your other meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not all granola is healthy, but not all granola is unhealthy either. This is one food where it’s important to do your label-reading.

In addition, we know they visited with unvaccinated individuals," the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said the risk to the general population is low, but it wants to inform the public of the "increased risk of measles in this region and the increasing number of cases in surrounding states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the department has limited details about who was exposed but is working to provide information and protection to those it can identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Earlier incident&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest measles case follows closely on the heels of an earlier case that also entered the state last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case first came to light Monday during a Summit County Board of Health meeting. The state health department confirmed that the individual was vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others," the department said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the stay in Idaho, the individual became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to the department. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn't make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic," said Derek Moss, Summit County nursing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed to have passed their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection and said, at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers. Health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's statement from the state health department said that due to the ongoing spread of measles cases throughout the country, public health and medical providers recommend the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the increase in measles spread across North and South America, we encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or health care provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributing:&lt;/strong&gt; Shara Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The results show that treatment with dapagliflozin improved metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)—a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, leading to inflammation—and liver fibrosis (a build up of scar tissue) compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASH affects more than 5% of adults, more than 30% of individuals with diabetes or obesity, and can progress to cirrhosis in up to 25% of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have reported that SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve liver fat content, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/liver+enzymes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;liver enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, and liver stiffness, but no trial has been carried out among patients with MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, researchers enrolled 154 adults (average age 35; 85% men) diagnosed with MASH after a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/liver+biopsy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;liver biopsy&lt;/a&gt; at six medical centers in China from November 2018 to March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half (45%) had type 2 diabetes, and almost all had &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/liver+fibrosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;liver fibrosis&lt;/a&gt; (33% stage 1, 45% stage 2, 19% stage 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an initial screening biopsy, participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of dapagliflozin or matching placebo once daily for 48 weeks and attended health education sessions twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various factors including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+weight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, liver enzymes, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, diet, insulin, and lipids were also assessed at enrollment and throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;MASH improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) or a NAS of 3 points or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an end of study biopsy at week 48, 53% (41 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group showed improvement in MASH without worsening of fibrosis (defined as no increase in fibrosis stage) compared with 30% (23 of 76) in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/placebo+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 23% (18 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group compared with 8% (6 of 76) in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH was also reported in 45% (35 of 78) participants in the dapagliflozin group compared with 20% (15 of 76) in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1% (1 of 78) in the dapagliflozin group and 3% (2 of 76) in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that the trial was conducted in a Chinese population, which limits its broader generalizability, and that female and older patients were under-represented. But they point out that results were consistent after further analyses, suggesting they are robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, they conclude, "Our findings indicate that dapagliflozin may affect key aspects of MASH by improving both steatohepatitis and fibrosis." Large-scale and long-term trials are needed to further confirm these effects, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming years are expected to be particularly exciting in the field of pharmacological treatment for MASH, say researchers from Argentina in a linked editorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more drugs become available, therapeutic decisions will likely become increasingly tailored to individual patient profiles, they write. "Ideally, such treatments should provide cardiovascular benefit, have an established safety profile, and be accessible to broad and diverse patient populations," they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

Utah hairstylist and horse owner @shelbylockhart witnessed this tragedy firsthand after her &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/foals-first-time-outside-mom-124500478.html" data-ylk="slk:new foal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;new foal&lt;/a&gt;'s mama sadly passed away shortly after bringing her little one Earthside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/moment-grieving-baby-horse-lets-124500094.html" data-ylk="slk:orphaned foal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;orphaned foal&lt;/a&gt; refused milk replacer, but Shelby had another plan. She found a nurse mare, or a lactating female horse with no foal to feed, and hoped that the two would connect despite suffering devastating losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What happened next brought Shelby and thousands of viewers to tears. This mom and baby couldn't be more perfect for one another!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These two were meant to be family! This &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mama-horse-instinctively-senses-close-214500364.html" data-ylk="slk:mama horse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;mama horse&lt;/a&gt; accepted the new foal with no hesitation or stress, and once the little one latched, she was just as content. It's hard to believe that both of these beautiful horses suffered massive losses just days before they met one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/community-comes-together-help-rescue-121500793.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Community Comes Together to Help Rescue Foal Who Was Abandoned by Her Herd;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Community Comes Together to Help Rescue Foal Who Was Abandoned by Her Herd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"So how does it work with a nurse mare?" a commenter asked. "She has to have a baby in order to produce milk. Where is her baby? Are they weaned, and you just keep using her to foster other foals?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/non-horsey-boyfriends-sweet-friendship-160000012.html" data-ylk="slk:Baby horses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Baby horses&lt;/a&gt; only nurse for the first 4-6 months of life, so producing milk for even longer could be exhausting to a mare. Sadly, this mama horse lost her foal as well, so she's producing milk to feed a baby who's no longer around. That's why these two are a perfect match despite suffering immense heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's such a gift to see this moment unfold, but I can only imagine how Shelby and the other equestrians in this video were feeling. This was the silver lining after two tragedies, but it's also the beginning of a beautiful relationship between this adopted mom and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's heartwarming to see how quickly and naturally these horses have bonded, even if it wasn't Plan A. &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/nurse-mare-adopts-foal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse mares;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nurse mares&lt;/a&gt; like this new mom are an absolute gift to the equine world, though she never would have met her foal if it weren't for selfless horse owners like Shelby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can't wait to see what's in store for these two!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people are quite concerned about the amount of radiation that comes with a CT scan.  Radiation can increase the risk of cancer down the line… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;but by how much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" title="" target="_blank"&gt;A new study was published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jwatch.org/na58693/2025/04/24/new-estimate-ct-scan-associated-cancer-risk" target="_blank"&gt;updates &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;our best estimates.  As a primary care doc I order my fair share of CT scans, but I always try to make them worth the risk for the patient.  Whenever possible and appropriate I will favor an ultrasound or MRI, but these options are not all equivalent in terms of what they can see, how fast they see it, and how often insurance companies will pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so for this quick boost I’m going to efficiently review the risks of radiation from CT scans as reported in this most recent study.  Then we will briefly review CT versus MRI versus ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope you find this post both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reassuring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alarming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CT scan cancer risk study: key findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This comprehensive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed cancer risks from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;93 million CT scans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; performed on 62 million Americans in 2023 alone, providing updated estimates of radiation-induced cancer risks (using detailed radiation dose data and national utilization patterns).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Individual cancer risk per CT scan&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absolute risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; of developing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single CT scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; varies dramatically by age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infants (&amp;lt;1 year)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Little ones have the highest risk at approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 additional cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (2% absolute risk). Infants under 1 year old have dramatically higher radiation-related cancer risks because their rapidly dividing cells are more susceptible to DNA damage from ionizing radiation, their small body surface area means they receive a higher radiation dose per unit of body weight during CT scans, and they have many more years of life ahead for radiation-induced cancers to develop and manifest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenagers (15-17 years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Much lower at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (0.2% absolute risk), but still more than any of us would like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Risk continues decreasing with age, though specific per-scan rates weren't provided for all adult age groups. The authors emphasize that the risk is highly variable and depends on multiple patient and examination factors.  And yet I decided to go there and I think this calculation from their data is a good ballpark:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;90 million adult CT scans in 2023 were projected to result in 93,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This yields approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.03 cancers per 1,000 adult CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These figures represent the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifetime excess cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a single CT examination, meaning the additional cancer cases beyond what would normally occur in the population.  This linear dose model suggests that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risks are additive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; - meaning:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Relative risk context&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study authors offer a pretty sobering conclusion: if current CT practices continue, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT-associated cancers could account for 5% of all annual cancer diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the United States. This places CT radiation exposure on par with other significant cancer risk factors like alcohol consumption (5.4%) and excess body weight (7.6%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cancer types and demographics&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common projected radiation-induced cancers are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 22,400 cases (70% in women due to higher radiation sensitivity)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colon cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 8,700 cases (59% in men)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leukemia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,900 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bladder cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,100 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 5,700 cases in women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children face higher per-scan risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; but account for only 9,700 of the projected cancers due to lower CT utilization. Pediatricians and pediatric specialists really go out of their way to try other imaging techniques.  Perhaps we should all be doing this more vigorously for adult patients, but it’s tricky (see below).  The most common childhood cancers from CT exposure are estiamted to be thyroid (3,500 cases), lung (990 cases), and breast cancer (630 cases).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High-risk examination types&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abdomen and pelvis CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; pose the greatest population risk, accounting for 37% of projected cancers (37,500 cases) despite representing 32% of examinations. This reflects the higher radiation doses from multi-phase scanning commonly used in these studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Population-level impact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study projects approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;103,000 future lifetime cancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (90% confidence interval: 96,400-109,500) will result &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;from CT scans performed in 2023 alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Sensitivity analyses suggest this number could range from 80,000 to 127,000 cancers depending on various assumptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This represents a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-4 fold increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a similar 2009 analysis that projected 29,000 cancers from 2007 CT use. The increase stems from 30% higher utilization, improved dosimetry methods revealing higher actual radiation doses, and better accounting for multi-phase scanning techniques.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a radiologist, nor an oncologist.  I welcome any dissenting opinions or references.  But as a primary doc trying to keep up with the latest across multiple disciplines, this potential cancer risk as published in a respected journal is by necessity something I need to know, consider at the point of care, and report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key implications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the discussion of this study emphasizes that CT scans are often lifesaving, the massive volume of use (93 million annually) means even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;small individual risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; translate to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;substantial population health impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The authors stress the critical importance of justifying each CT scan and optimizing radiation doses, particularly avoiding unnecessary multi-phase examinations when single-phase scanning would suffice diagnostically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for continued efforts to reduce unnecessary CT utilization while maintaining the significant clinical benefits these examinations provide. Remembering to substitute ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging whenever possible is a good cancer-prevention tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When CT scans are needed&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it were simple, we would order nothing but MRIs and ultrasounds, as these tests do not use ionizing radiation (associated with DNA damage and slightly increased cancer risk).  So here is a quick primer for the layperson that might help in our next discussion with a doc who is about to pull the trigger on an imaging study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are frequently chosen over radiation-free alternatives like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; because they offer unique diagnostic advantages that often outweigh radiation concerns, particularly when evaluating abdominal pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; avoids radiation entirely, it has significant limitations in abdominal imaging due to interference from intestinal gas, operator dependence, and poor visualization through bone or air-filled structures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though excellent for soft tissue contrast and bowel evaluation with specialized techniques like MR enterography, requires 30-60 minutes to complete, may not be readily available in urgent situations, and can be limited by motion artifacts and patient factors like claustrophobia or metallic implants. MRIs often require days to get insurance company authorization, and are much more expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; can comprehensively evaluate multiple organ systems within minutes, providing excellent visualization of bones, soft tissues, and bowel structures regardless of patient body weight or bowel gas. This speed and reliability make CT particularly valuable for detecting time-sensitive conditions like appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pulmonary embolism, or internal bleeding, where rapid diagnosis can be life-saving. If you are in the ER and need imaging, chances are a CT will be ordered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients with vague abdominal pain, like in primary care outpatient settings, CT's ability to simultaneously assess the liver, kidneys, pancreas, bowel, and other structures helps identify serious pathology that might present with non-specific symptoms, often providing definitive answers that guide immediate treatment decisions and avoid prolonged diagnostic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;One sentence conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope this does not scare people into avoiding recommended CT scans, but rather gives some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individual reassurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;population-scale pause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so that we can all be more thoughtful when getting that imaging study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;--—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Among 343 participants, those who had taken classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin reported significantly lower anxiety and PTSD symptoms than those who used other substances or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that certain psychedelics may influence the brain’s processing of trauma, potentially offering insight into new treatment pathways. However, researchers caution that these results do not endorse unsupervised psychedelic use and call for more controlled studies to understand the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower PTSD Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Classic psychedelics were linked to reduced anxiety and trauma symptoms in festival survivors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlled Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held up after accounting for age, gender, psychiatric history, and prior use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution Emphasized:&lt;/strong&gt; Authors stress that this is not a call for recreational use but a prompt for further therapeutic research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking new study conducted by researchers from Reichman University and other Israeli institutions explored the psychological aftermath of the deadly terrorist attack at the Nova Festival in southern Israel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack, which took place on October 7, 2023, claimed the lives of nearly 400 people and left hundreds more physically and psychologically wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110663"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg" alt="This shows people and a swirly background." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.

Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after the massacre, the researchers administered in-person psychological questionnaires to 343 survivors aged 18–64, examining the participants’ mental state, the psychoactive substances they consumed before and during the festival, and the ways those substances may have affected their physical and psychological response to trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety following exposure to war and terrorism is becoming an increasingly pressing global mental health concern, scientific understanding about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of these conditions remains partial and limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, most knowledge in the field is based on research in animal models, rather than on direct evidence from humans exposed to extreme traumatic events — especially not under the influence of mind-altering substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what makes the Nova Festival an exceptional event — it was a real-world situation, as opposed to a laboratory simulation, in which trauma and psychedelics intersected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results remained statistically significant even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, previous psychiatric history, and prior psychedelic use. For example, while the average anxiety symptom score across the entire sample was 1.90, it dropped to 1.38 among the survivors who had taken classic psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zohar Rubinstein of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “This is a powerful example of the simultaneous exposure of almost 4,000 people to a traumatic event on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The survivors’ willingness to cooperate with us during such a difficult time allowed us to examine the effects of psychedelics at a relatively early stage of symptom onset, and in a more natural setting (compared to therapeutic settings). These data are of great clinical importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einat Karp Barnir, a clinical psychologist at the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University, said: “A few days after October 7th, I began volunteering as a clinical psychologist in a healing space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After dozens of conversations I had with survivors, I started to notice that some of those who had been under the influence of certain substances appeared to show milder symptoms — less anxiety and fewer post-traumatic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around the same time, I came across an article claiming that substance use could increase the post-traumatic stress of those who were at the Nova Festival. The discrepancy between what was being said in the media and what I was seeing on the ground sparked the idea for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I contacted Dr. Zohar Rubinstein, and we decided to explore the connection between the type of substance taken at the party and the severity of psychological responses after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At a time when understanding and treating trauma is more relevant than ever, there is still a lack of sufficient information about the factors that influence the formation of traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study sheds light on the differing effects of various substances and contributes to our understanding of how traumatic memories are formed and retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such an understanding could one day not only improve treatment, but even help prevent the development of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Rany Abend of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “What the survivors have given us — through tremendous courage — is a unique glimpse into how mind-altering substances affect the formation of trauma, based on their personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main finding of our study indicates that the brain systems activated by classic psychedelics are involved in the connection between the experience of a life-threatening event, the formation of a traumatic memory, and the emergence of psychological symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of research on this important topic, provides new insights for researchers and therapists, and presents real-world evidence that the use of classic psychedelics may reduce trauma symptoms — an important finding with implications for both research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers emphasize the need for caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings are not intended to encourage the free and unsupervised use of psychedelics, nor do they suggest that such use constitutes a form of treatment,” Dr. Rubinstein clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, they point to potential mechanisms — which need to be further investigated — that may explain how supervised use within an integrative psychological treatment setting may yield therapeutic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p

responses 3 weeks after exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence indicates the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds for post-traumatic stress, yet the mechanisms mediating their effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delineating the effect of psychedelics on traumatic memory formation could shed light on target therapeutic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report on 343 adult survivors of a single, large-scale terrorist attack taking place during a festival in which different psychedelic compounds were consumed, in whom levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms were assessed 3 weeks following the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings indicated that those who were under the influence of classic psychedelics during the attack reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic responses compared to those who were under the influence of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and those who consumed no psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the protective effects of classic psychedelics for post-traumatic responses manifested more strongly among participants who did not consume additional recreational substances alongside psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that pharmacologic targets of classic psychedelics may modulate the formation of enduring trauma memories and confer a protective effect against the development of post-traumatic stress and anxiety responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put yourself […] in the mind of a 3-, 4-, or 5-year-old,” Oliver Burkeman instructs me. “You just get up every day, and you have no say. I mean, of course, you get some say, but you know what I mean? Where you live, where you’re going — you know that the plans are just completely outside of your control. Which, in a sense, is a very deep truth about the human condition, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this week’s &lt;a href="https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/"&gt;Mini Philosophy interview&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke with the best-selling author and philosopher Oliver Burkeman about his various books, all of which, in their way, explore human mortality and limits. In &lt;em&gt;4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/em&gt;, Burkeman makes the disarmingly stark point that we have only so many days on this planet. &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/thinking/rule-of-saint-benedict-oliver-burkemans/"&gt;We cannot do everything. We have to choose where and how to spend our time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, we paused to zoom in on a problem this finitude presents: How can we marry the ideas of mortality and limit with the human need to control things? We imagine ourselves immortal, but the world has a habit of reminding us we’re not. In spite of all the evidence, many people insist on struggling along with some vain, fruitless, and unhappy project to make sure everything goes a certain way. Endless choice. Unrestricted access. Knowledge. Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does that need come from, and is there a better way available to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-control"&gt;The need to control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Burkeman pointed out, children have no problem being told what to do. I’m sure many parents or teachers are screaming at the screen, “You’ve not met my kids!” Still, most young children, especially, have normalized the idea that “grown-ups” will tell them what to do and give them what they need. The food in the fridge fills up miraculously, the TV just turns on with the click of a button, and “Mom, where are we going today?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hallmark of growing up is taking responsibility. And, as all Uncle Bens of the multiverse will tell you, when you have power, you have responsibility. As an adult gains control over those things previously handed to them by other adults, they feel anxious and stressed. As existentialists like Søren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre pointed out, with control comes &lt;em&gt;ennui&lt;/em&gt;, angst, and analysis paralysis. Burkeman put it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What happens, as you get older, is you start to exert control, or at least influence, or try to get into control of things. And then people get a lot of anxiety when they realize the limits to their control. People are very aware of their vulnerabilities, yet still want to exert control. There’s this anxiety that comes from realizing you’re fragile and finite, yet you keep trying to manage or control that fragility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like some insatiably voracious wolf, we gorge ourselves on more and more control, and groan under the indigestible weight of its inadequacy. And along the way, we forget what simple, calm happiness there is in not being in control. We forget that limits have their comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-limited-life"&gt;A limited life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the answer to this? Of course, we cannot become children again. The bills need to be paid, that toothache needs fixing, and the fridge won’t fill itself. We cannot flop on the couch and call for Mom to bring us a snack. Nor should we live a life free of morality and responsibility. Our actions matter. We can control and change things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burkeman offers two points here. The first is to reclaim what the word “meaning” means. Over several millennia, a “meaningful life” was often defined in relation to God or some religious ideal. In a modern, secular age, it’s come to be defined as changing the world in a great, sweeping, “I’m going to get a statue” reform. But as Burkeman told me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these implicit definitions of meaning are being smuggled in where it can’t possibly be meaningful to cook dinner for your son or volunteer at some local organization because you’re only helping a few people, and in a millennium, no one will ever know they even existed. To me, that’s just a strange and unhelpful definition of meaning. So, why can’t it be meaningful? Why can’t something be meaningful to do just because it doesn’t become a sort of permanent fixture of the time-space continuum forever or something?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dancing-monk"&gt;The dancing monk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burkeman’s second point concerns how we can find the balance between anxiously needing to control everything and a despairing, hopeless quietism that says, “&lt;em&gt;Que sera sera&lt;/em&gt;” to absolutely everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a third way, and Burkeman gives me an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine three people dancing at a wedding. First, there is the child. The child twirls around, giggling and jumping, with the insouciant joy of one who has never been shamed. Dancing is fun, and so they dance. Second, there is a 30-something groomsman who shuffles awkwardly about the dance floor, nervously trying to look cool. Small step to the left. Small step to the right. Safe and inoffensive. Third, there is the dancing monk. They are dancing with the happy abandon of the child, but not from immaturity; rather, with the mature, intellectual recognition that they cannot change other people’s perceptions. The monk knows two things: “I like dancing,” and “I cannot make people like or dislike me.” And so, they dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, for Burkeman, is what a happy life means. It’s one that lives in the joyful space between control and passivity. It’s one that recognizes limits and lives with them. It’s jumping into the boxed walls of the sandpit to make castles and cities. Happiness is a monk dancing at a wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
