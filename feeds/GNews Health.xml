Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic who oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, had announced the change in recommendations before the CDC updated its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been proven safe and effective. Additionally, this vaccine is not associated with any fertility issues in either women or men," the association said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APhA's said pregnancy is a high-risk condition, and, people who are pregnant should be recommended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Puyaan Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 22:59:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOSzRuVDR3MmpvM0g3Zy02Qm11cElncnJrdFJsWVd4Uzc1eG1XWVl1b3VrU0xQMHBjLXZGMXlKZllqWVZsdjRfZUJ0bFFqSHpBTXhhQ0xfY0JzVl85b3lKSDBxUzVtQ1V0dmdZelBIeDk4QmdxaEExcVM1X1l2cTNpVHRTRUFydw</guid></item><item><title>人们现在正在报告令人恐惧的COVID症状—以下是须知事项- HuffPost | People Are Reporting A Frightening COVID Symptom Right Now — Here's What To Know - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNUTBRWFR5QVprMlFwbWt0aVFqdVRyTjFhbHhnVWlpc2JFbmZhWVJzNXJySlRFRHlqbm01d0d2d25ubUFFQV9GSUQ3eFZQVXR1dXY5Q0hFcjNsbTktZGM5ZXhaX0tYZ3hRdkhISHgwS1BLdzZ1aGJjWk82VGxmZFpOWGxvQ1Fya3pmT1F3cllYUDV1Q2VyajBFdmt5VGhmd9IBowFBVV95cUxPWFlzZW9GdC1yU1RJN1lHc2JYRVVrX2FqbXZodm8tcUFfSDRyanZkOXRaT1drSG9uNktMY1J3X01VdVJWdW5zd0tHOXNIYUlCUVhMRUNmNS1OM2lCdTJMT0k5MDB0eTZuV3doMG5QM0tkaml4UmVlRXJRdTNNU3kyVnFSRG9USzVJSTg5TnhieElCR0tmNGRPSGNFNHU4bmlQU05R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; test result is not something that anyone wants to see — but now there may be an extra reason to avoid getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID infections cause miserable symptoms such as fever, fatigue, congestion and more.

Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published this year pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes and uncovered how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found that many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won. "Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes that were linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

The ability of these genes to impact cascades and networks of processes, such as gene regulation, could explain why the same variants can contribute to different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pleiotropy was traditionally viewed as a challenge because it complicates the classification of psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, if we can understand the genetic basis of pleiotropy, it might allow us to develop treatments targeting these shared genetic factors, which could then help treat multiple psychiatric disorders with a common therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a very useful strategy given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates 1 in 8 people (almost 1 billion in total) live with some form of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders"&gt;psychiatric condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.12.022"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in February 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She has a passion for painting and puzzles, an extended social network and an optimistic outlook. She “exemplifies healthy ageing”, Topol says, and he classifies her as one of the “wellderly”. In contrast, most people are the “illderly”; only about a quarter of people aged 65 to 74 in the UK have no diagnosed long-term health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div id="3.0"&gt;&lt;div id="e31bf542-9015-45ca-a887-0522c43e6266"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The cardiologist Eric Topol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;CHARLIE NEUMAN/U-T SAN DIEGO/ZUMA/ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A professor at Scripps Research in San Diego, California, Topol, 70, has published a series of bestsellers on the future of medicine as well as more than 1,300 journal articles. For one research project he looked at 1,400 people who were aged 80-plus, had never been sick and had never had one of the big three chronic illnesses: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease. He found there was little in their DNA that accounted for their healthy ageing, but they were considerably thinner than their peers, exercised more, were better educated than the general population, and were upbeat and sociable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One thing Topol says can’t be emphasised enough is that cancer and the major age-related diseases of the heart and brain can incubate for 20 years at least before revealing themselves clinically. Those years offer a great opportunity to work on preventing such illnesses. With that in mind, he has written a new book, &lt;i&gt;Super Agers&lt;/i&gt;, in which he lays out how to achieve one’s maximum health span — the number of years lived in optimal health — and shift from the illderly path to the wellderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You’re going to gain healthy ageing years by adopting these very important lifestyle changes,” Topol says. And the earlier you do so, “the more years of healthy ageing you gain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Adopt an anti-ageing diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is an advocate of the Mediterranean diet, which is high in vegetables, fruit and fibre. He hasn’t eaten red meat for years. “It’s pro-inflammatory, so if you’re going to have it, don’t make it a frequent thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He recommends using the app Open Food Facts to scan packets to identify ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which he says he is “religious” about avoiding. One day UPFs will be regarded in a similar way to cigarettes, he believes. “A lot of these are pro-inflammatory and they’ve been linked with all three major age-related diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-slow-ageing-top-tips-ways-slxs665g7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to slow ageing: nine tips from a longevity expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There is little evidence that intermittent fasting improves anti-ageing, and until there is more, his advice is to eat an early dinner and avoid consuming any more calories until breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He drinks a cup or two of coffee in the morning. “I don’t drink it because it’s going to improve healthy ageing, but that’s a bonus.” Observational studies have shown that there is an association between drinking coffee and lower risk of various cancers, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes, although this could be linked to other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;You don’t need to be teetotal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I’ll have a glass or two of wine on weekend nights. That’s about it for me,” Topol says. The data is clear that anything more than moderate drinking (seven drinks a week for men; four to five for women) is not good for us. However, social engagement is important for healthy ageing and that often involves a drink. Topol’s best summary of the studies of light alcohol intake (a couple of drinks a week) is that it is not a problem, but the risk quickly increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ditch the supplements &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His patients often provide long lists of the supplements they’re taking. “I just shake my head. They’re wasting a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.16"&gt;&lt;div id="5c805ec1-bc59-49fb-9c68-b100e81032a5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Richard Morgan, 93, on the rowing machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ROW2K.COM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;It’s never too late to start exercising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol cites the case of Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman who had never exercised regularly before he reached his seventies, when he started using a rowing machine in his shed and then went on to win indoor rowing competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Even walking briskly for just over an hour a day is associated with living for four and a half years longer than those who don’t exercise. Though it is important, if walking is your main exercise, that your heart rate is increased for a sustained period of 30 minutes or longer and you are not simply counting steps accrued during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/anti-ageing-vaccine-is-closer-than-ever-but-what-helps-now-mvxfmh9q3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-ageing vaccine is ‘closer than ever’ — but what helps now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For years Topol emphasised to his patients the importance of aerobic exercise, but he has become convinced that preserving core strength is also vital. “In the past year-plus I’ve been very diligent about incorporating balance and strength training,” he says. Topol strength trains four times a week using resistance bands and exercises such as planks and lunges, as well as balance training and completing a similar number of sessions of aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling and swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He also tries to get outside regularly; a UK Biobank study found that long-term exposure to greenery where we live was associated with reduced anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Deep sleep matters &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About seven hours of sleep is the optimal amount. Surprisingly, sleeping beyond seven hours may be associated with signs of cognitive and mental health decline, Topol says. There also appears to be a relationship between sleeping for more than eight hours and heightened all-cause morbidity — though Topol stresses that this is at a population level, and that some people perform better with eight or six hours’ sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Among the benefits of deep sleep, or non-rapid eye movement sleep, is that it helps to clear the brain of metabolic waste that may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Using a sleep tracker, Topol discovered that he was getting as little as 15 minutes a night of deep sleep. Some experts suggest we need one to two hours, but it depends on our age, Topol says. He increased his deep sleep to an hour a night by adopting a stricter bedtime routine, stopping exercising and eating late in the evenings, and hydrating earlier in the day so he didn’t wake to urinate. He is sceptical of sleep medications, some of which could make toxins in the brain more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;The tests that could help you li&lt;b&gt;ve longer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genome sequencing is underused, according to Topol, who says it is vital for identifying disease-causing genetic mutations in those with unknown illnesses (last week &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/david-cameron-dna-test-sick-children-build-register-mx5g5zf87" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;David Cameron called for all infants admitted to paediatric care to be tested for unusual genetic conditions&lt;/a&gt;). In some cases, a test to reveal disease-causing genes — particularly those associated with cancer — may cost only a few hundred pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/why-sitting-unhealthy-standing-how-to-stay-fit-zq8brhr5c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why sitting for more than 60 hours a week is ageing you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Polygenic-risk tests for specific diseases are also available for common cancers, heart disease and Alzheimer’s. They can be sought at private clinics and online and test a sample of saliva or blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Organ clocks, which measure proteins in the blood, can reveal which individual organs are ageing faster than the rest of the body. Studies have been carried out with UK Biobank participants, and Topol expects commercial tests will be available in the near future — and will eventually form a routine part of health assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;But don’t say yes to every test &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is scornful of companies offering full MRI scans. “That’s completely off the rails,” he says. “The chance for harm is greater than the potential benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scans can also lead to unnecessary interventions. He has seen patients almost bleed to death from a liver biopsy or who suffered a collapsed lung “from a biopsy of an innocent nodule”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is dismissive of Bryan Johnson, the Silicon Valley biohacker who is spending $2 million a year trying to reverse the ageing process, and of private clinics offering blood transfusions from young people at $8,000 a litre. “Ridiculous! We have longevity clinics that charge $250,000 a year. It’s reckless and predatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Microbiome tests are popular, but Topol cautions that there isn’t a reliable commercial test yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Beware of anti-ageing drugs &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He worries that not enough is being done to tackle serious threats to our lifespans, including environmental pollution, microplastics and “forever chemicals”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The jury is still out on some scientific advances, including much-hyped anti-ageing drugs. “Some are very effective in mice and rats, but rodents are not people,” he says. “There’s some very strong science that’s being pursued but there’s no guarantee we’re going to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, he is excited about where science is taking us. A company called Infinity Bio has developed a blood test that can determine a person’s exposure to more than 500 viruses. This may become commercially available in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ozempic could prevent diseases in old age &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol’s greatest enthusiasm is reserved for GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, which he says may play a role in “the next frontier for medicine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These gut hormones that talk to the brain and talk to the immune system are going to be one of the most important groups of medicine going forward to help prevent the big three diseases — cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative — and we have trials for Alzheimer’s ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is not overly concerned about the side-effects. “Gastrointestinal side-effects usually dissipate in the first few weeks. The side-effect of muscle mass loss in people who are obese can be countered by resistance training.” But he does have one reservation: he is not a fan of people having to take drugs for the rest of their lives. “It would be nice if we had a weaning strategy, and the companies don’t appear to have any interest in that.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super Agers by Eric Topol (Simon &amp;amp; Schuster £22).

Rates among older millennials, born in the 1980s, were more than four times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even with those increases, appendix cancer still remains extremely rare. Doctors diagnose an &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979656/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 3,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States each year, compared with more than 150,000 cases of colon and rectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a time of growing concern about the earlier onset of certain cancers, including colorectal, breast and kidney cancers. The new research describes what’s known as a “birth cohort” effect, or a disease becoming more common among successive generations. Such an effect lends credence to the idea that people born after a certain time have had similar exposures to something that is increasing their cancer risk more so than among people born decades before, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And the fact that researchers have seen similar generational effects in colorectal and gastric cancers suggests there may be some shared risk factors between those cancers and appendix cancer, said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who researches the epidemiology of colon cancer and also was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Diet is one such possibility, he said.

Summers in Southwest cities have set records in recent years for prolonged heat waves that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/19/seniors-heat-wave-phoenix-arizona/"&gt;can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; for people who cannot find &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/excessive-heat-renters-ac-cooling/"&gt;places to cool down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MPDZAKFWHNHOZDJ5ITFJDWG56E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were about 600 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year, about half of which were of people experiencing homelessness, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5934"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the county’s Health Department.

A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844692/" target="_blank"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; looked at how temperature impacted mortality among the homeless in counties surrounding Los Angeles and Las Vegas between 2015 and 2022. It found that nearly half the deaths of homeless people in the Las Vegas area in that period were attributable to heat, and about 5 percent in the Los Angeles area were — “orders of magnitude greater” than in the general population, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKLI7XUYRZH7XHJZ5JS5M6FOEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weckstein, who will soon start her residency in internal medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said she wants to be a practitioner working mostly with homeless individuals. She noted the need for more affordable housing and better access to shelters and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/15/cooling-centers-limitations-heatwaves-cities/"&gt;cooling centers&lt;/a&gt;. Her research “points to the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable groups,” she said, “and the need for policies that protect those at greatest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:16:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQdG9Fb3BESEdZTFJneUlIU21yZ2ZSTFR5WUxENTFpRU5Ka0ROWEhUOWpXMzk0WVFaRTluV2cxcFcxRWUyczBrMjFYVTBMVEljWnM5NWdqNmRWZTQ1d0ZRdHlhQnFMdzBLWDV0dnk1U1JXVm42WndGcjVQOTZuY1Q0NS14SnFEV294VHR4bzF1YTBfaXNrNVFXeXJ3</guid></item><item><title>由于研究发现严重风险，每周性生活少于一次的夫妇会发出警告- UNILAD | Warning issued to couples who have sex less than once a week as research uncovers serious risk - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOcW9HNVNxeGFwU0RWTWMzbEp5ZnQ4b3dRWUxlUC1yd3Uwd2N4M196VDM2Vk5aLTU2a2hEY2lxOHJhRm0wakE3ekx5dVpIZUZNUkhEVXhtN200YTRWN2NEcnJOQVFWODVHY0xhYXh2Ri1IejhIbjl0b2xNb01GLW1zTHFZWEZQcU5US1gyQWJaMkFiZTZfTjN5MmFpdmxMV3NnVlcwRzRtVHFwWjVW?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A warning has been issued to couples who have sex less than once a week after a new study lifted the lid on how sex relates to happiness in a relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;To be honest, there is no right or wrong answers when it comes to how many times per week a couple should be getting naughty in between the sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;I mean, whatever floats your boat, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Well, various studies have looked into the how much sex a couple have in a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;

It’s not uncommon as people age, affecting 15 to 30 percent of older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VGJKXPHEYFFZTGLPH2U7GJ35TM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Feeling less hungry occasionally may not be anything to worry about, but if it persists, it can lead to negative health consequences in older adults, says Mary Hickson, a professor of dietetics at the University of Plymouth in England. Here’s how to know when a lack of appetite may be harmful and how to help bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you feel less hungry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A4ALIDFWL5BA5KVSQA3A5LC2IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How appetite works isn’t well understood, but scientists know that the brain and the digestive, endocrine and nervous systems all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FSNEKKMZ5AMXN7N2EBVD2TBDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, metabolism slows with age, and that can make food less interesting. Your sense of taste or smell may diminish, and that can affect your appetite, too. Hormonal shifts may dampen the desire to eat and make you feel fuller when you do. Also, “life events,” Hickson says, such as retirement, loss of a job or the loss of a partner who did the cooking, “can trigger changes in what people eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XNJADEDNSZGALEANSCTPHDOSEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, the problem may not be related to the desire to eat but to difficulty eating. For example, saliva production can decrease because of age or a medication you’re taking (such as common ones for high blood pressure, an overactive bladder and depression). This can make food taste drier and harder to swallow. Tooth decay, poorly fitting dental work and jaw problems can lead to trouble chewing. And having little appetite may be a sign of some illnesses, such as an underactive thyroid or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RLSBCAXKENDTFGSBNY5KL7QAME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A prolonged lack of appetite and unintentional weight loss aren’t a normal part of aging, says Leah Cahill, an associate professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. See your doctor if the following signs last longer than a week: You’re skipping more meals, passing up formerly favorite foods, eating only a few bites at a meal or feeling nauseous at the thought of food. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;Losing weight&lt;/a&gt; without trying over a six-month span should also trigger a health-care visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens when you don’t eat enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAR2LAOJUNAGFBA5WYWX4MCBVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Taking in fewer calories can cause weight and muscle loss, which can zap energy and affect balance and strength. It also makes it hard to get the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you need. “The body requires nutrients for its basic functions, and not getting enough food can cause your body systems to weaken and not work as they should,” Cahill says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKUXXV5D2NBU7ODOZLXWULFDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frailty is another consequence, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jfa.2022.14" target="_blank"&gt;2022 international task force report&lt;/a&gt; on appetite loss and aging. Frailty, characterized by weight loss, weakness, being less physically active, exhaustion and cognitive decline, can make you more vulnerable to illness and falls, and to having worse outcomes when those occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Tips to boost appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MVY6BVHZF5E4FPAEGD7YX3SJSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In general, diet and lifestyle changes are preferred over prescription appetite stimulants because the latter don’t help much and have side effects. Forcing food on yourself isn’t a good move, either, because it can make you queasy, Hickson says. Instead, try the following strategies to help you improve your appetite and stay healthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ID6TAORWYJCUTA6KYVRLA2HVGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switch to mini-meals.&lt;/b&gt; Can’t manage a full meal? “Start with a smaller portion size of everything you would normally eat or have a goal of eating half of everything on your plate,” says Jen Bruning, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Or try having three smaller meals plus three snacks, Hickson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV6EO6L7VFJVBYK6NENLXDJRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize protein.&lt;/b&gt; It’s important for building and preserving muscle. It also helps fight infection and maintain skin elasticity, so “get some protein on the plate with every meal,” Bruning says. And to make sure you get it in, eat it first in case you get too full before you finish your meal. Eggs, cottage cheese, yogurt, fish, tofu, chicken and other lean meats, legumes and nut butters (almond, peanut, cashew) are all good sources. If you have trouble getting enough protein from food alone, having a protein drink (such as Ensure) or adding a scoop of protein powder to smoothies might be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I4MA35GXTFHV5MGMJMJNCKQXR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pair fruits and veggies with a dip.&lt;/b&gt; Any kind of produce makes a nutrient-rich snack. But fruits and vegetables are low in calories and quite filling. To get more of the vitamins, minerals and calories you need, serve them with nutritious higher-calorie dips, such as nut butters, full-fat yogurt, hummus or guacamole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJQATR3DDJCMLFKLJMDNO7U5BI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drink water between — not with — meals.&lt;/b&gt; You need to stay hydrated, but water can take up room in your stomach. As a result, you may leave too much food on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GBDBX2KYNJF23J3POM5W5X3NFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indulge in full-fat foods&lt;/b&gt;. Fat is the most concentrated source of calories, and older adults — especially those over 75 — can afford to carry a bit more weight, Hickson says. So it’s okay to have full-fat milk, cheese and yogurt, and butter on your toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PLCSRIC2XFECVDWDKYHOFCECJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use herbs and spices liberally.&lt;/b&gt; They add flavor to food, and the aroma as they cook can be an appetite stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L2W32FLWPFFNBLJPAAYI2HFMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat with others when you can.&lt;/b&gt; Research shows that you might eat less if you eat alone and that having company might increase your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Little meals that pack a big nutrition punch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSNRRA5IMRBGZP6QMTLIAOBG4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, moderately active men over age 50 require 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day to get the fuel and nutrients they need, while women of a similar age and activity level need 1,800 calories. If you’re not feeling very hungry, it can be tough to eat that much food. One solution is to have smaller portions spread out throughout the day and to ensure the food you eat is full of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O4UPBULSNFAWXK2V7MVREEVM7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s an example of what a healthy daily menu containing about 2,000 calories might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7RWJKTDTAZADDOGEHJNC2KJA5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breakfast.&lt;/b&gt; Soft Taco Scramble: Scramble 1 egg and 2 egg whites with Monterey Jack cheese and ½ cup of fresh baby spinach.

              &lt;p&gt;Your zip code may shape your aging brain’s health. New research out today shows that people’s odds of being diagnosed with dementia differ significantly across different parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2834952"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Neurology. They analyzed the medical records of veterans, finding that dementia rates were noticeably higher in the Southeast, Northwest, and other regions, even after accounting for some possible factors like income. The findings suggest that deep-seated regional differences can contribute to dementia risk, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a growing public health issue, particularly among the elderly. More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia currently and a government-funded study this February &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states"&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt; that 42% of Americans over 55 will develop it in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a complex condition, with most cases caused by a mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. But according to senior study author and neurologist Kristine Yaffe, there’s been little research looking at how the risk of dementia can vary geographically, at least on a national level. Yaffe and her team had access to a dataset that had the potential to shed light on that: deidentified records from people enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We realized the VA national data would allow for such an investigation as the VA has a uniform way of capturing data across the U.S.,” Yaffe, who is also chief of neuropsychiatry at the San Francisco VA healthcare system, told Gizmodo in an email. “There are no other national healthcare systems that have this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s team studied the health of more than 1.2 million randomly selected VA patients 65 years and older who had no pre-existing dementia. These people were followed for an average length of 12 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, dementia rates were lowest in the Mid-Atlantic region, covering states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Using this as a baseline, the researchers found that dementia rates were 25% higher in the Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama); 23% higher in both the Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) and the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas); 18% higher in the South (Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana); 13% higher in the Southwest (California, Nevada, and Arizona); and 7% in the Northeast (New York).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is a very large difference, especially given that these are all veterans with care at the VAHS,” Yaffe said. “It was really surprising we saw such big differences.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers reasoned that factors such as a person’s average level of education, how rural a state was, or the rate of other health conditions like heart disease within these states might explain most of the variance they found. But even when they adjusted for these variables, the patterns barely budged at all. That could mean there are other reasons—reasons not so easily captured through medical records alone—why someone in New Jersey will tend to have a lower risk of dementia than a similar person in Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the differences are explained by lifelong differences in things like education quality (vs quantity) and social determinants of health might be driving some of the differences,” Yaffe said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings now leave open more questions to be answered, which the team plans to start digging into. With any luck, the lessons they learn might help us find new ways to better prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Merck said in a release that it expects orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the virus starts to spread widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from RSV are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to ensuring availability of [Enflonsia] in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems," Dr. Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot will compete against a similar blockbuster treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide during the 2023 RSV season due to unprecedented demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are preventative monoclonal antibodies, which deliver antibodies directly into the bloodstream to provide immediate protection. But each targets a different part of the virus, making it difficult to compare them directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant's body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi on Monday &lt;a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2025/2025-06-09-05-00-00-3095598" target="_blank"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;an aggressive effort to increase supply of Beyfortus, including a plan to begin shipping the shot early in the third quarter. Last year, Beyfortus booked sales of €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines for RSV are also available in the U.S. from companies such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The shot also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 19:30:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPRVhrOUVhUVZwNFJsTFJ3THM1VldHNUI2cW1SejVjS19udi1mYklQVVZhS1hCZzZnX3FqNThOWG53Q0lPN3ZwUW5wMEVGdDRNczNUWExvQm1sdzgxWUU4bzM2OTBuOGlFWml4R00xd29yZmFVTG05Z1A5djR6SjJ2Y0UycWRLUWdfMkVnNS1kYllweG45aW1TLVl2UFBMSVZHUGs0WXhqQdIBrAFBVV95cUxOQUM1eXNNZTBuNi1pTkctXzBUUzItb3hRekFCNVZQODZ5Ql9RRjRLT2VUZ2JDR1lWcUNNRTNyYjBKdko0WkE5OUI1UlRDeUVPbXZNblg5cUhWMWxPbDBCTGdJUkdSTzBPa1hOUE9TczNyc1Bfcmo0U1YzOG1nUjdFT0lwUUNMN216X1l0bjlHeHdIU3Nhc3l2ck5UOWd2YkZvNnZmQzRqR2psbllf</guid></item><item><title>什么是TRT ？专家讨论男性“绝经期”以及如何安全地治疗低睾酮-《纽约邮报》 | What is TRT?

&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it. RJK Jr. has explored a few controversial ideas, particularly in the health and wellness sector. But, regardless of where you stand on his views, one thing is hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back at those viral videos of him &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pumping weights&lt;/a&gt; at Gold’s Gym back in 2023, he was in phenomenal shape for a man his age — biceps bulging, chest chiseled, pecks defined. He could have been an amateur bodybuilder. For a nearly 70-year-old, he was &lt;em&gt;ripped&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the videos surfaced, rumors began buzzing that Kennedy was on steroids. He promptly denied it, instead crediting his disciplined 35-minute workout routine. There was one other thing he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I take testosterone replacement, which are appropriate to my age, and then I take a big fistful of nutrients,” he explained in an &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Newsmax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes associated with menopause are not so secret. Women are warned about hot flashes, mood swings, and decreased periods — all of which have been studied and scrutinized for as long as most of us can remember. But &lt;em&gt;Man-opause&lt;/em&gt;? Until recently, it has remained a blind spot in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age-related decline in testosterone levels, sometimes called Andropause — or “Manopause” colloquially — has often been met with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Emerging research has begun to spark conversations around male aging and hormonal health. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17062768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology revealed that testosterone levels in American men have dropped about 1% per year since the 1980s. The decline can not be attributed to aging alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






	&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some endocrinologists have studied the root causes, suspecting the decline is due to the increase in ultra-processed foods, pesticides, as well as drug use, and other environmental concerns. Others are focused on the best ways to raise levels back to the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people like Deep Patel, co-founder of the telehealth company &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, the statistic was a catalyst for exploring Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) as a potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like the male version of menopause, except no one acknowledged it until recently,” Patel told the New York Post. “And look, the data backs this up. Endocrinologists have documented a population-wide decrease in testosterone levels over the past few decades. It’s not just in people’s heads.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels typically begin to decline when men reach their forties, at which point, some will start to experience a range of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, everything from hair loss and lowered libido to decreased muscle mass and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes are to be expected, but others can reveal a larger condition, hypogonadism. Men with particularly low levels of testosterone — “Low T,” as the guys say — could also suffer from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, osteoporosis, and even infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine whether levels are healthy or low, men can take a TRT test. These blood tests, typically administered in the morning when levels peak, examine the amount of the male hormone present in the blood. The &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;normal range&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be anywhere between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For men outside the normal range, some Doctors recommend trying TRT, the routine that RFK Jr. and millions of others have embraced as part of their anti-aging and health protocols. On TikTok, the tag “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/trt-before-and-after?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TRT Before and After&lt;/a&gt;” has amassed thousands of videos and millions of views showcasing brawny men flexing their quads and joking about their sudden burst of energy and newfound sex drives. Unlike Kennedy, many of these men are still young, in their twenties and thirties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT has become more accessible through providers and online TRT companies like Ulo, but it’s essential to recognize that it’s only &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; for specific conditions, such as hypogonadism or diminished functional activity of the gonads. TRT is not FDA-approved for men with low levels due to aging or other non-medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical experts still have varying opinions on treatment. Some believe that the “normal range” does not sufficiently identify men who could benefit from TRT. Others take a more conservative approach, warning that the potential side effects outweigh the benefits and that TRT should be reserved for men with particularly low levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is testosterone declining in America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels have declined substantially over the last couple of decades, and experts believe several factors may be contributing to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, testosterone is declining in American men of all age groups, young and old. No one is talking about that,” shared Dr. Michael Aziz, the author of “&lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="0757325149" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAgeless-Revolution-Hallmarks-Defeating-Reversing%2Fdp%2F0757325149%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Ageless Revolution&lt;/a&gt;” and an anti-aging internist and regenerative physician specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azis believes that the decline in level is tied to several environmental problems, dietary changes, and how men socialize. “This has to do with increased consumption of ultra-processed food, use of pesticides, excess alcohol, legalization of recreational drugs, smoking, and trans fats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the ideal testosterone levels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most medical centers and experts considered normal testosterone levels to land anywhere between 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, age is also an important factor. Azis explained that it is important to look at each patient individually in order to determine whether their levels are considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If testosterone levels are checked, the lab reference is wrong, as it groups all men. Lab levels are 300-1000 nanograms per deciliter, so men in their twenties who are supposed to have a testosterone of 1,000 are placed in the same category as 80-year-old men with levels of 300,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, Azis explained that some young people with low levels are told that their results are normal when, in reality, they could be ideal candidates for TRT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many men suffer as doctors treat those men with drugs for depression or ED pills, versus looking at testosterone levels,” Azis warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is TRT, and how is TRT used to treat low testosterone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mostafa Abu-Hijlih, a nurse practitioner practicing at Grand Central Men’s Health in NYC, says that TRT has been a game-changer for his patients. He always felt there was a gap in clinical spaces for men to discuss issues that have been historically stigmatized, but TRT opened up the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone Replacement Therapy is a medical treatment used to optimize testosterone levels in men and women when indicated, ” Abu-Hijlih explained. “Testosterone is responsible for energy levels, libido, muscle mass, and bone density, and has been shown to improve REM sleep time when optimized.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT works by replenishing the lost testosterone that the body is not producing naturally. It’s not about taking extra testosterone but rather restoring the body to a healthy, normal level. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abu-Hijlih pointed out that the dosage depends on what is needed for each patient, and testosterone levels should be continuously monitored to determine the appropriate dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is TRT administered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Abu-Hijlih, there are a few different options for TRT patients when it comes to how testosterone is administered and absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;blackday – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT is administered through a variety of modalities, including weekly intramuscular injections, topical cream, implantable pellets, or even intranasal nose spray,” he noted. “Really depends on a combination of clinical results, patient preference, and tolerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for patients to try different administration techniques until they find the one that works best for them. About 90% of Abu-Hijlih’s patients undergo TRT via a weekly intramuscular injection into their arm or their glutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of TRT&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of TRT include increased energy, improved sleep quality, higher libido, enhanced intimate performance, and better results at the gym. Abu-Hijlih described how many patients begin to feel young again, with more motivation to participate in all the activities they used to love, but no longer had the energy for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The improvement in overall quality of life is always incredibly gratifying to witness,” he shared. “They walk in standing taller, [with] higher levels of confidence, regained energy levels to work out at the gym again, and have a bounce in their step that makes it a very gratifying experience for both the patients and the provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has also revealed that TRT is an effective option for addressing psychological and sexual symptoms associated with hypogonadism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6765788/#:~:text=Men%20most%20frequently%20claimed%20testosterone,emphasis%20on%20sex%20and%20energy." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; on prescription testosterone found that 52% of men claimed testosterone improved their energy, 42% saw improvements in their libido, and 29% reported muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can benefit from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Patel is not a physician, but he has built his career around solving real-world problems that men deal with every day. His telehealth company, &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, has been working to make TRT more accessible to men than ever before, and he says that their services are not bound to men over 50.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger men can benefit from TRT, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More and more men in their twenties, thirties, and forties are dealing with low T,” Patel shared. “About 40% of men over 45 have clinically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;low testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re seeing younger guys affected too. If that sounds like you, it’s worth getting your levels checked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get TRT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many providers and telehealth sites offer TRT services. In many cases, the first step is taking a TRT test and speaking with a doctor about symptoms. Companies like Ulo treat patients holistically, considering their specific needs and tailoring the treatment to their individual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest mistake people make is doing TRT without medical guidance or buying unregulated testosterone products online,” Patel said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At Ulo, we monitor every guy’s complete bloodwork regularly, not just testosterone, but also things like hematocrit, estradiol, and lipid profiles — and adjust treatment accordingly to catch issues before they become problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that the best way to minimize risk is to work with a legitimate provider who actually looks at your bloodwork and adjusts your protocol based on how your body specifically responds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to see results from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that symptom relief can look different in everyone, but you shouldn’t have to wait long to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As for results, most guys feel a difference within four to six weeks,” he noted. “More energy, better mood, stronger libido. The body composition changes, like more muscle and less fat, usually take a bit longer, around two to three months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel cited one TRT patient who knew the treatment was working when he woke up one morning and actually wanted to go to the gym for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is TRT safe? What are TRT risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When properly monitored, research indicates that TRT can be safe long-term for most men. That said, every patient needs regular blood work to ensure their levels stay within a healthy range, according to Patel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRT does come with risks that need to be taken seriously. The most common side effects include acne, water retention, or elevated red blood cell counts, which can thicken your blood,” he shared. “Some men experience testicular shrinkage or reduced fertility. There are also concerns about cardiovascular risks in certain populations, particularly men with existing heart conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can TRT affect fertility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, TRT can affect fertility, especially if you’re not using anything to counteract it. TRT significantly suppresses natural testosterone production, which can also reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6305868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sperm production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But if fertility matters to you, there are medications like HCG or enclomiphene that can be taken&lt;br&gt;alongside TRT to preserve it,” Patel pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, over 90% of men maintained normal sperm counts when using these fertility-preserving medications with TRT. Patel stressed the importance of telling providers that fertility is a priority before they begin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does TRT cost? Does insurance cover TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of TRT varies depending on factors such as your insurance coverage, provider, treatment needs, and the location of the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some insurance providers do cover TRT, but patients must meet specific thresholds. Most providers require TRT candidates to have medical documentation that indicates their testosterone has fallen below the normal levels, as well as recorded symptoms like fatigue or low libido.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re paying out of pocket, the cost of TRT will depend on the type of treatment. Most testosterone injections cost between $50 and $150, oral tablets around $300, and patches can reach $400. Some telehealth companies offer a range of treatments for a monthly subscription cost, which can range from $100 to $300 per month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you try TRT? Is it worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Patel has seen many men suffer from low testosterone firsthand. It’s not uncommon for him to hear them say things like “I can’t focus like I used to,” “I feel flat mentally, physically, sexually,” “I’ve lost my drive,” or “I just don’t feel like me anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after optimizing for sleep, diet, and everything else, their low testosterone was still impacting their everyday lives. Once they received treatment, things began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re not looking for shortcuts. They’re looking to feel normal again,” Patel said. “And, often they’ve tried everything else — better sleep, different diets, supplements, lifestyle changes. TRT is rarely the first thing they try, but for many with genuinely low levels, it’s the solution that finally works.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT could be right for you, but, as with any new health treatment, it’s important to consult your physician and explain your symptoms prior to making any changes to your regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is a preventive monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants against a spectrum of RSV disease severity, including worsening disease requiring hospitalization&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="bwalignc"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is the first and only RSV preventive option administered to infants using the same dose regardless of weight&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bw-dateline-wrapper"&gt;RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- &lt;/span&gt;
Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates (newborns) and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is a preventive, long-acting monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season, with the same 105 mg dose regardless of weight. A typical RSV season usually spans autumn to spring of the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RSV disease is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. and can lead to serious respiratory conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia,” said Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and investigator for the CLEVER (MK-1654-004) and SMART (MK-1654-007) trials. “ENFLONSIA combines dosing convenience with strong clinical data showing significant reductions in RSV disease incidence and hospitalizations, making it a promising new intervention to help protect infants from RSV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA should not be administered to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA. See additional Selected Safety Information below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) evaluating a single dose of ENFLONSIA administered to preterm and full-term infants (birth to 1 year of age). The trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints, as outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="bwlistdisc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) requiring ≥1 indicator of lower respiratory infection (LRI) or severity compared to placebo through 5 months (primary endpoint) by 60.5% (95% CI: 44.2, 72.0, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.026; placebo, 0.065).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in RSV-associated hospitalizations through 5 months (key secondary endpoint) by 84.3% (95% CI: 66.7, 92.6, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.004; placebo, 0.024), showing increasing efficacy with increasing disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is also supported by results from the Phase 3 SMART trial (MK-1654-007) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA versus palivizumab in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ENFLONSIA provides an important new preventive option to help protect healthy and at-risk infants born during or entering their first RSV season with the same dose regardless of weight,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are committed to ensuring availability of ENFLONSIA in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet later this month to discuss and make recommendations for the use of ENFLONSIA in infants. Ordering is anticipated to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the start of the 2025-2026 RSV season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA (clesrovimab-cfor) is Merck’s extended half-life monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for passive immunization for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is administered using non-weight-based dosing and is designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season. For infants born during the RSV season, ENFLONSIA is to be administered starting from birth. For infants born outside of the RSV season, ENFLONSIA should be administered prior to the start of their first RSV season. For infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass during or entering their first RSV season, an additional 105 mg dose is recommended as soon as the infant is stable after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selected Safety Information for ENFLONSIA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not administer ENFLONSIA to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with other human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema (3.8%), injection-site swelling (2.7%) and rash (2.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Clinical Trials and Data Supporting U.S. FDA Approval&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04767373&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04767373&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=bce1f4aa575013b9fa9bac315951e307" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04767373&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in early and moderate preterm infants (≥29 to &amp;lt;35 weeks gestational age [GA]) and late preterm and full-term infants (≥35 weeks GA) entering their first RSV season. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive a single 105 mg dose of ENFLONSIA (N=2,411) or saline placebo (N=1,203) by intramuscular (IM) injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary endpoint was the incidence of participants with RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infection (MALRI) characterized as cough or difficulty breathing and requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI (wheezing, rales/crackles) or severity (chest wall in-drawing/retractions, hypoxemia, tachypnea, dehydration due to respiratory symptoms) from Day 1 through Day 150 (5 months) after dosing. Medically attended includes all health care provider visits in settings such as outpatient clinic, clinical study site, emergency department, urgent care center and/or hospital. The key secondary endpoint was RSV-associated hospitalization through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants entering their first RSV season was generally comparable to placebo. The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 3.8%; placebo: 3.3%), injection-site swelling occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.7%; placebo: 2.6%) and rash occurring within 14 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.3%; placebo: 1.9%). Participants were monitored for serious adverse events (SAEs) through the duration of their participation for up to 365 days post-dose. Most (≥97%) of the adverse reactions were toxicity grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SMART trial (MK-1654-007) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04938830%3Fintr%3DClesrovimab%26rank%3D3&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04938830&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=e35858ee892e471e42dc431ade70ecef" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04938830&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 3, randomized, partially-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-site trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease, including early (&amp;lt;29 weeks GA) or moderate preterm infants (≥29 to ≤35 weeks GA) and infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease of any GA. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive ENFLONSIA (N=446) or palivizumab (N=450) by IM injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their first RSV season, the trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA was generally comparable to palivizumab and consistent with the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants in the CLEVER trial. The efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease was established by extrapolation of efficacy of ENFLONSIA from the CLEVER trial to the SMART trial based on similar pharmacokinetic exposure. The incidence rates of RSV-associated MALRI requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI or severity and RSV-associated hospitalization were generally comparable between ENFLONSIA (3.6%, 95% CI: 2.0, 6.0 and 1.3%, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.9, respectively) and palivizumab (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.5, 5.2 and 1.5%, 95% CI: 0.5, 3.2, respectively) through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, when ENFLONSIA was given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines, the safety profile of the co-administered regimen was generally comparable to the safety profile when ENFLONSIA and childhood vaccines were administered alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Merck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

&lt;p&gt;The patients came in with high cholesterol. And it was the kind that clings stubbornly to arteries and shadows families for generations. They walked into a clinical trial and left, perhaps, with a glimpse of the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early results from a small study, a single infusion of an experimental medicine called VERVE-102 cut levels of LDL cholesterol — the so-called “bad cholesterol” — by as much as 69%. And it did so not with daily pills or monthly injections, but with a one-time genetic edit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is reality; it’s not science fiction. We’re actually doing it,” said Dr. Riyaz Patel, a cardiologist at University College London, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/new-cholesterol-treatment-could-be-revolutionary-verve"&gt;for the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flipping-a-genetic-switch"&gt;Flipping a genetic switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Globally, almost half the adult population suffers &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/3236"&gt;from high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. While we have drugs like statins that can lower cholesterol, you need to take them daily. But VERVE-102 is no ordinary drug. It’s a form of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; base editing — a precise method of rewriting DNA without breaking the genetic code. This particular edit targets PCSK9, a gene that helps regulate how efficiently the liver clears out LDL cholesterol from the blood. Fewer PCSK9 proteins mean more LDL receptors on liver cells, and less cholesterol clogging the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The early trial, known as Heart-2, enrolled 14 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a genetic disorder that leads to dangerously high cholesterol levels from an early age. These weren’t your average patients with a bad diet, they often require lifelong therapy and still face an elevated risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each participant received a single intravenous infusion of VERVE-102, which packages the gene editor inside a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to deliver it directly to the liver. There were no reported side effects and no signs of liver damage in any participant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers gave participants three different doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 0.3 mg/kg, patients saw a &lt;strong&gt;21% reduction&lt;/strong&gt; in LDL cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At 0.45 mg/kg, the reduction averaged &lt;strong&gt;41%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At 0.6 mg/kg, LDL dropped &lt;strong&gt;53% on average&lt;/strong&gt;, with one patient achieving a &lt;strong&gt;69% reduction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are extremely promising results, despite the study being in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-could-be-huge"&gt;Why this could be huge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol, a waxy substance essential for the body, becomes a killer when it accumulates in arteries, forming plaques that can rupture and cause heart attacks or strokes. Lowering LDL is one of the most effective ways to prevent these events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 was designed initially for people with inherited high cholesterol, but its underlying mechanism — &lt;em&gt;permanently switching off the PCSK9 gene&lt;/em&gt; — could be relevant to anyone struggling with high LDL cholesterol. PCSK9 plays a central role in regulating how much LDL the liver can remove from the bloodstream. Inhibiting this gene helps lower cholesterol in almost anyone, regardless of their genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, many existing cholesterol-lowering drugs, like PCSK9 inhibitors, already target the same protein. The difference is that VERVE-102 aims to make that change permanent, with a single treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-study-is-still-needed"&gt;More study is still needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/14/3060774/0/en/Verve-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Initial-Data-from-the-Heart-2-Phase-1b-Clinical-Trial-of-VERVE-102-an-In-Vivo-Base-Editing-Medicine-Targeting-PCSK9.html"&gt;initial results of the clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; have not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to test higher doses. Two patients in the 0.7 mg/kg cohort have already received VERVE-102. So far, no red flags have emerged. Verve expects to release full results from this dose escalation phase later this year and begin a Phase 2 trial — a larger test that will include U.S. patients for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is watching closely. It has the right to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug if it chooses to “opt in.” That decision is expected in the second half of 2025, when we should also have more data on the effectiveness of this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This treatment is not a cure for everyone with high cholesterol. But it could be a lifeline for those struggling with it the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating cocoa-filled dark chocolate as part of a balanced diet may stave off dementia risk with aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and staying physically active can also help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When eating dark chocolate, look for options that are lower in added sugar and rich in cocoa content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve learned to expect memory slips or trouble completing basic tasks as we age. But these types of cognitive effects aren’t always a normal part of aging. In some, they’re a sign of a more serious condition known as dementia. “Dementia is a decline in brain function that leads to confusion, memory loss, mood changes and, in some instances, loss or decline of bodily functions,” says&lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. While genetics and age play a role in the risk of dementia, other lifestyle factors like diet, exercise and sleep are also linked to the condition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately for many of us, there’s one food that may protect against mental decline: dark chocolate. Dark chocolate’s star ingredient, cocoa, is packed with flavonols, which may benefit brain health and function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But the source and quantity of cocoa matter. Keep reading to learn how cocoa can benefit your brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like many other plants, cocoa contains plant compounds called flavanols, which have antioxidant properties. “These flavanols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and they’re especially known for supporting blood flow and keeping blood vessels healthy,” says&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thewholesomeself/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Ghida Arnaout, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Cocoa flavanols may be particularly helpful for the brain, as they can protect against loss of neurons and other forms of inflammation in the brain. “They protect cells from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation throughout your body and brain,” says&lt;a href="https://cravingsomethinghealthy.com/about/about-anne-danahy-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Anne Danahy, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-supports-healthy-blood-vessel-function"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Supports Healthy Blood Vessel Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A major benefit of cocoa flavanols is that they protect blood vessels, allowing them to relax and dilate more easily as blood pumps through,” says Danahy. “With healthier blood vessels, blood flow to the brain is improved, enabling more oxygen and nutrients to reach brain cells while also allowing waste to be removed. That’s particularly important for reducing dementia risk, because restricted blood and oxygen can damage brain cells or parts of the brain, triggering cognitive decline or vascular dementia.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies have shown a protective effect against insulin resistance with a diet rich in flavanols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When insulin is too high, blood flow can become constricted, which negatively affects brain function. While research has found an association between insulin resistance and cognitive health, the mechanism by which insulin resistance affects cognitive function and dementia is still being studied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While chocolate bars and other sweetened chocolate treats like cakes and cookies are common sources of cocoa, they’re also often high in added sugar. But when it comes to cognitive health, too much added sugar can be a concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Considering the cocoa source and form can help with moderating added sugar in the diet while also offering protective benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, we can’t just eat chocolate and expect to lower our risk of dementia. The brain is a complex organ that’s influenced by many lifestyle factors. Following these strategies can help reduce the risk of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation and support the structure of brain cell membranes, which is key for brain function,” says Arnaout. These unsaturated fats are found in a variety of foods often lacking in the typical American diet. Foods like fish, nuts and seeds all contribute to&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; upping omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; in the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seafood, nuts and seeds is one of the best ways to preserve your brain health,” says Ali. This doesn’t mean you need to eat a pescatarian or vegetarian diet. But adding more plants to your plate can offer increased nutrient diversity and anti-inflammatory compounds that benefit your brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A physically active lifestyle benefits all aspects of your health, including cognitive function. Studies have found a significant association between greater amounts of physical activity and lower dementia risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Find ways to stay active, whether via planned exercise or as part of daily living (such as with active transport), to benefit cognitive health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleeping less than five to six hours per night can increase the risk of dementia, especially in those 50 years of age or older.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The brain depends on sleep to process information, store memories and remove waste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By prioritizing quality sleep, you allow your brain to rest and recharge while ultimately lowering your risk for dementia over the long term.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, eating chocolate is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Fortunately, that bit of enjoyment may offer health benefits beyond satisfaction and enjoyment. Including cocoa in a nutrient-dense, balanced diet may stave off dementia risk with aging. Other lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and staying physically active can also help prevent cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;

So she posted on Facebook that she had been affected by a reduction in force, or RIF. A month later in a conversation with a friend, Binion mentioned the fact that she had lost her job. He reacted in total shock. "I thought that was an April Fool's joke," Binion's friend said of her Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMHSA (pronounced sam-sah), which is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services, might not be a familiar acronym to most people. The agency supports Americans who suffer from mental health conditions and who experience addiction. SAMHSA operates the 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline, which has received more than &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/988/performance-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;14.5 million calls, texts, and messages&lt;/a&gt; since it launched in July 2022. The agency also assists communities with grants for treatment and recovery centers, especially in rural areas where long distances from treatment centers act as a barrier to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has proposed &lt;a href="https://doctorsforamerica.org/sr-samhsa-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rescinding&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in funding from SAMHSA, cuts that will reduce the agency's workforce by 50 percent. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to create a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and &lt;a href="https://www.naatp.org/advocacy/public-policy/major-federal-agency-change-announced-today-administration-healthy-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; multiple agencies including SAMHSA. These cuts face pending legal challenges, and Binion's termination was delayed after a judge's preliminary injunction. "I don't think people understood how much SAMHSA did," Binion said. "And a lot of the programs are being destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Binion about her personal connection to mental health work, the value of peer support in the recovery process, and her fears around policy decisions made without robust data. (Binion spoke with me from her position as an individual, not on behalf of SAMHSA or any government agency.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in working in public health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always wanted to help people, so I wanted to be a social worker. My dad said no to that, because [he said] they're burnt out and they don't make money. He wanted me to go in business, and I refused to do that. Anyway, I love education. My mom's an educator, so I got my degree in community health education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was raised in Prince George's County Maryland. Prince George's County Maryland was, for years ... the wealthiest black community in the entire country. One of the reasons why we were the wealthiest black community was just location. The reason for that is a lot of people—I would say 90 percent of my family—worked for the federal government. Everybody was outside of D.C. The federal government was a stable job. ... So growing up, the message from my father was, get a federal job. Get a federal job. Get a federal job. It's the most stable, and you're going to have the best benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked in a hospital for a few years. I worked at the Baltimore City Health Department. When the Affordable Care Act went through in 2010, they added a lot of jobs to CMS, which is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So I said, "Oh, I'm going to apply there." It took me four years to get into CMS. People don't realize how hard it is getting into the federal government. But I got in there, and I said, OK, I love it. I'm where I was supposed to be. I'm doing public service. ... I had to be what's called a contractor officer representative, or a COR. Basically you're overseeing all the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years into me being at CMS, my daughter had [psychiatric and mental health challenges], and [was diagnosed with] a serious mental illness. I was thrown into complete chaos. A mental disorder was not even in my periphery. I was out of work a lot. We're in year three or four of this, and my daughter's been hospitalized 10 times. ... Because I was thrown into mental health because of lived experience, I decided to switch my career to SAMHSA. Because I started seeing the cracks in the systems. But then I also saw some of the good parts in the system. I took a lot of classes just to better get ahold of my daughter. We have an awesome relationship now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went into CBHSQ at SAMHSA, which is the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. I now have a certification in trauma. I also have a certification in crisis support, I started to do trauma-informed care. The goal was to better my relationship with my daughter. But then I realized that I liked it, and then I started running support groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMHSA really focuses on co-occurring substance abuse disorders and serious serious mental illness. Thank God they really focused on peer recovery support. These are all the types of things I've run into just from the lived experience with my daughter. Peer recovery support is, "I've had a mental illness, I'm in recovery. I had substance use disorder, I'm in recovery. And now I'm working to help people as they find their way through their journey." What I learned with my daughter was, these doctors and nurses, they will come in, but she's like, they don't know what I'm going through. But when you have a peer there, there's a level of empathy peers can give that other people can't give. ... SAMHSA put out this idea: We should have people in recovery actually giving the services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have this churn between hospital, homelessness, and jail, right? A lot of people with serious mental illness or a substance use disorder will go through this kind of churn. CBHSQ, the center that I was in, they did a lot of data collection. The data that we collected informed other programs and SAMHSA and also informed the public. They came up with jail diversion programs. I just did a support group, and a parent is in there. He's like, "Oh, my son's in jail again." ... I'm like, what happened? "Oh, he walked into a Walgreens naked." What about that screams, &lt;em&gt;arrest this man&lt;/em&gt;? He's in psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[One service at] the Office of Treatment Services, it was &lt;a href="https://findtreatment.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FindTreatment.gov&lt;/a&gt;. We have a survey called &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/n-sumhss-national-substance-use-and-mental-health-services-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;N-SUMHSS&lt;/a&gt;, which is the National Survey of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. We're collecting all the data [from] all the facilities. So if you actually go to FindTreatment.gov ... they have a lot of filters. They say, here's the substance abuse facility near your house. Here's the insurance they accept. They [RIFed] all of us who run that program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you talk about what an average day looked like for you in your role at the Office of Treatment Services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on DAWN as [one of] the [contracting officer representatives.] ... DAWN stands for &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drug Abuse Warning Network&lt;/a&gt;. So what SAMHSA did, along in partnership with our contractor, is that we contracted with hospitals and emergency departments all over the country. We would go into the hospitals, and ... collect all of their data, [such as] emergency room visits based on some type of substance, any type of substance. But of course, a lot of the numbers that we saw were illicit drugs. So that could be either meth or heroin. There was a whole list. We monitored all the new drugs that we've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another part of my job was to help write the different manuscripts. They asked me to help because of my lived experience. The manuscript that I was working on before we got RIFed ... was state hospitals and psychiatric readmissions. So we're looking at the readmission rates and factors that either help or hurt the readmission rates, like a low number of beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had so many different aspects of DAWN. From training the hospitals, to recruiting the hospitals, to training the abstractors, to looking at all the data that's coming through and trying to make a story of the data. Here are the new drugs we're seeing. We also wanted to be a real surveillance system where we had early warning. Early warning is that we have something called [a] sentinel hospital, which is a hospital in an area ... that's known to have high overdose stats. So we would collect data from that hospital, and we would see some of the new drugs that were coming. So we could say, [as a hypothetical example], hey, Minnesota, hey Minneapolis, we're starting to see a mix of Seroquel and meth. That's the new mixture that we're seeing ... Let's just say five patients in four weeks came through with the overdose of this new mixture, right? ... This combination of drug could be an issue. Then we would look to see what, DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, what are you seeing on the streets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would love if you could share your experience of learning about your termination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at CMS during [Trump's] first term. That's what happens when you work for the federal government. No matter who's in office, you still have to serve the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February is when we started to get scared, and it just became toxic and chaotic. ... Everybody was shaking in their boots. My boss had to keep saying, we're going to go on like it's everyday business as usual. Then one time we had a meeting, she was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have this meeting on April 1 [assuming we're still here]." We were like, what? We're like, OK, are we getting RIFed? We don't know. So I think for the entire month of March, people were ready. Oh, we're going to get the RIF notices this week. Oh, we're going to get the RIF notices next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many people in SAMHSA work for SAMHSA for the exact same reason I work for SAMHSA. Because you have lived experience, either with a family member or with yourself. The &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/about/offices-centers/or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, I would say a lot of them have lived experience. I don't think people just wake up one day and be like, I want to work for SAMHSA. A lot of people don't even know SAMHSA exists, right? ... SAMHSA had organizational groups, and one was a lived experience group. I was in that group, and a lot of them were like, yeah, we have to really implement our coping skills. Because recovery is an ongoing, lifelong thing, right? You have to actively stay in recovery. You would have some people like, "Yeah, I have upped my AA meetings from once a month to once a week now. Because I'm stressed. This anxiety is triggering a lot." It was very demoralizing. You feel like you're not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I didn't go into the office only because I have multiple sclerosis. So I got a reasonable accommodation. ... A lot of people at SAMHSA, they've had lived experience. And people just have health issues. [Because of] all this stress, I had MS flare ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did it on April 1. ... I woke up and I had eight messages from different coworkers. What happened was, so the building that SAMHSA and HRSA ... the Health Resource Services Administration. I think HRSA is in there. The Indian Health Services is in there. So I think it's three main government and NIH is next to us. And one of the NIH buildings are next to us. You got three different agencies trying to get in one building. This is in Rockville [Maryland]. It took them two hours to get into the building—[the] line was &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;. This is how people knew: They would badge in, and if it was red, you were RIFed. You just hear people break down and cry. That took up the entire line. You just hear people wailing and screaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to just check if there was any other personal aspect to [your RIF] that you'd want to share?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I took it for granted that the federal government has the best health care. I have multiple sclerosis. My drug is $80,000 a year. My daughter has been hospitalized 10 times. I remember calling my physical therapist. I was like, Yeah, you know, I was RIFed. I said, "Come June and I might have to switch my health insurance to United." They were like, but you have Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal. I was like, yeah. They were like, you know there's no other health insurance better than that, right? I said, "I know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run support groups, and all the cuts they're doing to SAMHSA, they're saying, "Oh, well, this was under DEI, right." But who's suffering? Who's dying? Who has a lot of the mental health issues? Who's disproportionately affected by mental illness and substance use? Yeah, it would be the populations that a lot of the DEI was targeting. Mind you, one of the main populations that went under DEI was rural [communities]. ... We had a good focus on the rural community, because they're not near the big city, and there was a whole [issue of] access to care. I'm really concerned for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's going to take a long time for me to find another job. The financial insecurity is at times overwhelming. The destruction of SAMHSA was also very, very, very depressing. My concern is the infrastructure that SAMHSA has built, 20-plus years [of] building, their influence—they've made real systemic change. Especially with the early psychosis program. Especially with some of their family. Especially with 988, [the suicide and crisis hotline] was huge. Instead of calling 911 for a mental health crisis, call 988, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if I don't go back to SAMHSA or the federal government, I'll still be working in mental health. And I feel like this is going to make everything worse. I partner with NAMI, which is the National Alliance of Mental Illness, and they usually almost never comment on anything political. But they're out here saying we're concerned for the cuts to Medicaid, for the cuts to all the mental health block grants. The safeguards for behavioral health, the framework, this is a lot of complex needs, high needs population. I'm very, very concerned on what's going to happen with the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you foresee any immediate impacts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the data that we're collecting on all the healthcare systems, the opioid crisis, all that, the different substances, the psychosis, again, serious mental illness, we collect a lot of data on that—the data informs [policy.] We're not just making arbitrary political decisions, right? This goes for CMS too. At CMS we never, ever made a decision or wrote any type of policy without having some type of research or data, right? The data informs sound policy decisions. And I'm scared that that's going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's so ironic about all this is SAMHSA was signed into law by [George H.W.] Bush, a Republican, and it was introduced to Congress by Edward Kennedy ... RFK, he's had past substance use struggles. We really thought, oh, well, RFK comes in, [and] he's going to really support us. ... ... But when it comes to mental health, he should be on board, right? SAMHSA has just been so instrumental in reducing the opioid overdose deaths. We've established the 988 mental health crisis response. ... We collect national data on mental health and substance use. We were really promoting the peer workforce. People with lived experience, let's get them in there. And we did it. We were looking at underage drinking. We were looking at youth with psychosis, with the early intervention programs. This infrastructure is going to be completely disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're scared that some of the key programs are going to be eliminated. One of the reasons why I decided to [do this] interview is because I said, I don't think people realize how much SAMHSA did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when people who need services come in? What's going to happen to FindTreatment.gov when people are looking for services in their area? We're supposed to be a credible, trusted source. The government, your government, that you pay, is supposed to be a .. credible, trusted source. And I'm scared we're going to lose that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Defector</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWlphMFVjNm1MSDk1LTB6UHlFc1FJUEthNk9mQVNsbkdqaXpTek9GMmNUdzRKb2c1aTFWY0Q3VkIzaEFXMjR6bnY4bi14ZDJDVUc2bzFzMlgzR3lfTnh5ajZnZnpZN3RSQlhtdkVEcnhjcm9hazdIQnVZdmZiRzB1VHB2VU9zbUZyUVRIMkxqdEN4bjhKUWY5LUo2MU5WS0QyWmlqZ2pTNnZIdl9VV3A5RGNwcG5Sdw</guid></item><item><title>营养师推荐的6种有助于降低胆固醇的最佳谷物- EatingWell | The 6 Best Cereals to Help Lower Cholesterol, Recommended by Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5kaUdTNzhzS1F5amJhcmxGbkxpMWVac1pFZ3JPVjRuZHBEbEdsY01IMU1sdGc3XzNvWjJEZzRqbzNhWTlkQnVyU0NMYUxzMk5ZUThObUpaZjVPdWdMWWxpVlBWall6d0lDd29ET3lqRzJXRlRlWFZyN3pR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cereal may seem like a humble breakfast choice, but certain boxes on grocery store shelves can do more than just quell your hunger—they may also help lower your cholesterol. And considering &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; increases your risk of health issues like heart attack and stroke, making simple healthy swaps in your daily routine can go a long way in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-heart-health-8610881" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protecting your heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cereals [can be] beneficial for cholesterol reduction primarily due to their high soluble fiber content, especially beta-glucan, which is found in oats and other whole grains,” says &lt;a href="https://www.blissfulnutrition365.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ambrazia Sublett, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She adds, “Here, this fiber acts like a ‘toothbrush’ in your arteries, sweeping away excess fat particles (cholesterol) in the bloodstream.” In other words, certain breakfast cereals may help reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels and promote a more ideal ratio of HDL (“good”) cholesterol to LDL cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all cereals are created equal, though. To make sense of the health claims and nutrition labels, we spoke with three registered dietitians to find out which cereals may actually help lower your cholesterol levels and deserve a spot at &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8022936/best-breakfast-for-high-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the breakfast table&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072346/whole-grain-to-eat-for-better-heart-health-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best choices you can make for heart health&lt;/a&gt;, says Sublett.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They’re packed with beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that helps lower LDL cholesterol. Just make sure you’re using the plain kind—no added sugar, no extra stuff,” she adds. Of course, what you pair with your cereal also makes a difference. “Try adding fruits with the skin, like apples or pears, for an extra boost of fiber. And when it comes to milk, go for options that are low in added sugar, whether that’s almond, oat or regular dairy,” Sublett recommends.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheerios are one of the most accessible ways to get &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering fiber&lt;/a&gt; into your diet—especially if you’re short on time or don’t love hot cereal. “Even Honey Nut Cheerios, though a little sweeter, still carry some of those benefits,” says Sublett.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to pouring yourself a bowl at breakfast, Cheerios also work well as a topper for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-high-protein-snack-for-better-heart-health-8764499" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; for a boost of fiber and protein at snack time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kellogg’s All-Bran Bran Buds contain psyllium and oat bran—two dynamos in cholesterol reduction. “Psyllium combined with oat bran creates a synergistic soluble fiber matrix that can further reduce LDL cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://www.elitebodydata.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yaa Boakye, RDN, LDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. She adds, “Psyllium is known to act via increased bile acid excretion and may enhance oat beta-glucan’s effects.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from beta-glucan, Boakye says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; is another powerhouse soluble fiber that’s effective for binding and lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Look for cereals specifically mentioning ‘psyllium’ or ‘psyllium husk’ as a primary ingredient,” says Boakye.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kashi Organic Honey Toasted Oat Cereal is another great pick, thanks to its base of whole oat flour and oat fiber, which contribute beta-glucans. &lt;a href="https://nutritionbymegan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Huff, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt; also highlights the cereal’s 6 grams of fiber and 0 grams of saturated fat per serving. For lowering cholesterol levels, she recommends looking for cereals with less than 4 grams of saturated fat, since high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; intake is linked with elevated LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 9 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein and no added sugars, Catalina Crunch Cinnamon Toast Cereal is the perfect balanced breakfast, Huff says. “Fiber helps lower LDL cholesterol, and limiting added sugars is important because too much can raise triglycerides and decrease HDL (‘good’) cholesterol levels,” she explains. While this cereal isn’t cheap, you might be able to save money by buying it in bulk at Costco.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a high-fiber option with nothing added, Post Plain Shredded Wheat is a great pick, offering 8 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein per serving. “It’s made from 100% whole wheat and has zero added sugar—just fiber doing its thing,” says Sublett. She also points to a study where regular consumption of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-grain cereals&lt;/a&gt;, like this plain shredded wheat, was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating cereal isn’t just convenient—it can be an effective (and tasty) step toward lowering your cholesterol levels. Look for options made with whole grains, especially those high in soluble fiber. Keeping added sugars and saturated fats to a minimum is also important. “More than 8 grams of added sugar per serving, excessive sodium (above 200 milligrams per serving) and artificial trans fats (listed as ‘partially hydrogenated oils’) can counteract potential cholesterol benefits,” says Boakye. Whether you prefer a warm bowl of oats or a crunchy, high-fiber cold cereal, building heart-healthy habits can start with a single scoop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just keep in mind that you should always talk with a health care professional before making any changes to your diet, especially if you’re taking cholesterol-lowering medications. “Certain medications, particularly those that work by binding bile acids, may interact with high-fiber foods and could affect the absorption of both the medication and nutrients. The timing of when you consume high-fiber cereals relative to taking medications can matter significantly,” explains Boakye. &lt;br&gt;

But the scale of the outbreak in Ontario could overturn that achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since October, Canada’s most populous province has reported more than 2,000 cases – more than all of those in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States combined in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health figures show cases continue to climb despite efforts to quell the rise. Last week, the outbreak reached a grim milestone after the province recorded its first fatality. Moore told the media a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/canada-premature-infant-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;premature baby, who contracted measles in utero&lt;/a&gt;, died from medical complications, including the presence of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,” he said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant – in part because it contains a live virus that could be passed on to the fetus – public health groups recommend unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin if they are exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people, if they don’t want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore said that Canada’s high levels of vaccination had nonetheless blunted what could be a far worse outbreak, giving large swaths of the population protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty.

&lt;p&gt;But don't let these little buggers discourage you from enjoying summer! Learn more about what causes swimmer's itch and how to prevent it below. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic describes cercarial dermatitis, or swimmer's itch, as an itchy, red rash that can appear after swimming — primarily in freshwater lakes and ponds; however, it can also be present in saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash is caused by an allergic reaction to microscopic parasites carried by ducks, geese and other waterfowl; semi-aquatic mammals; and snails. The parasite's eggs, released into the water through animal waste, eventually find their way into infecting snails, where they live and grow until the snail releases them back into the water.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said once the parasites are released, they then burrow into another host, e.g., animals or people, causing an allergic reaction.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good news: The rash is temporary, as the parasite can't survive for long once it inhabits the human body. The severity of the infection also varies from person to person, based on a person's sensitivity, but the DNR notes you'll become more sensitive to it each time you're exposed. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I prevent swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to quell the nasty bug from infiltrating your serene weekend at the lake.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are recommendations from the DNR:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply waterproof sunscreen, skin oils and other emollients before entering the water to thwart the parasite from penetrating the skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from shore while swimming, as the organisms thrive in warm, shallow water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't let the water evaporate from your skin after getting out of the water. Towel off right away because parasites present in water droplets will look for a place to go as the water evaporates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discourage waterfowl from frequenting the areas near your dock and shoreline. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I do come into contact with swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as a swimmer's itch survivor myself, I personally send my most heartfelt condolences — but condolences won't help you ditch the itch.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNR recommends these treatments for relief:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply an anti-itch lotion or corticosteroid cream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bathe in Epsom salts, baking soda or colloidal oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply cool compresses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't scratch! Scratching your rash could cause a secondary infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Also, it is expensive and misses diagnoses in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That could soon change, as several research groups, including Professor Metz’s, are developing simpler diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, researchers at the University of Oxford presented results of a clinical trial for a potentially game-changing test where the patient is injected with an agent that lights up endometriosis under a SPECT-CT scanner (widely used in hospitals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agent, 99mTc-maraciclatide, binds to a protein seen when new blood vessel are forming – the endometrial tissue forms new blood vessels so it can survive and grow. This agent emits radioactive rays that are detected by a SPECT-CT, which can reveal if there is endometriosis and exactly where it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers presented results of a clinical trial for a potentially game-changing test where the patient is injected with an agent that lights up endometriosis under a SPECT-CT scanner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results of the latest study, presented at the World Congress on Endometriosis in Sydney last month, showed that the light-up dye was as accurate as laparoscopy in detecting endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The results from the Oxford study suggest that maraciclatide can visualise the very early stage of endometriosis showing the extent, location and stage of disease which is currently only visible at surgery,’ a spokeswoman for the maker, Serac Healthcare, told Good Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It has the potential to eliminate the delays of up to nine years in diagnosis which women experience, as well as allowing them to avoid surgery.’ It could be available within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another test that should be available soon is PromarkerEndo, a blood test that detects the presence of ten proteins associated with endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study of 805 women, published in the journal Human Reproduction, showed it was able to distinguish those with severe endometriosis with more than 99 per cent accuracy, and those with early-stage endometriosis with 85 per cent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professor Christine Metz, of the Institute of Molecular Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s planned to launch in Australia later this year, costing £455 to £720; it’s not yet known when it will reach the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Professor Metz and colleagues are comparing menstrual ‘effluent’ (the woman’s period, which also contains endometrial tissues shed from the womb lining) of thousands of women with and without endometriosis in search of differences to turn into a diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advantage is that menstrual effluent can be collected non-invasively (and cheaply) at home and could be useful both in diagnosis and assessing how patients respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial published research identified that the menstrual effluent of women with endometriosis had different stromal cells (connective tissue cells from the womb lining) and more inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new trial, the US team will enrol women who &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6345593/Hope-millions-women-endometriosis-scientists-edge-one-step-closer-cure.html"&gt;have symptoms of endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; who are considering surgery in order to get a diagnosis. Professor Metz hopes this diagnostic test will be widely available within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The need for better diagnostic tests is clear. ‘A lengthy wait for diagnosis means a delay in accessing treatment, during which the disease may progress, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6893835/Why-does-7-years-detect-condition-plagues-women.html"&gt;leading to worsening symptoms and a risk of permanent organ damage&lt;/a&gt;,’ said Faye Farthing, head of campaigns and communications at Endometriosis UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It can also have a huge impact on mental health, potentially impacting on relationships, career and education.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mild-to-moderate endometriosis can be treated with anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, as well as contraceptives to suppress the release of oestrogen, which can promote tissue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, women may be offered surgery to remove the tissue but, in 50 per cent of cases, symptoms recur within five years. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, the National Institute for Care Excellence approved a daily pill, relugolix-estradiol-norethisterone (brand name: Ryeqo) for patients where surgical and other medical interventions haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It blocks hormones that contribute to endometriosis as well as providing hormone replacement to protect bone density and reduce other effects, as the drug puts the body into artificial menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, a second once-a-day pill, linzagolix (brand name: Yselty) was approved. It works by blocking specific hormones to stop the endometriosis development, but patients need to take separate hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:31:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNQzdGVGVtY1pRNERlX00yZnlLaUI4enhPRjF5Yk05UUlqMEsxRGdCWXZXaUQzREpTZmVKRzlZdFh3cHdHY19TUnBsNXA5aV9kWV95VFhKeVhUQUJyb0hTNElWN2J5MTFMXzdycEs2Q3pVSGVhdWJ4WVR2MFM1blFFaXVsVExVREljQ0hoWGgwTGpxMHVDckJrcmxLWEQzM2haVjdWdEttMmVoZkxWTWhtZFB3dTVJSmVRbE1FLVR5Y0VaOTdRTmRIYg</guid></item><item><title>可怕的地图揭示了会让你考虑搬家的痴呆集群-每日邮报 | Terrifying map reveals dementia clusters that'll make you consider moving - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in the Rocky Mountains and Northwest US are among those with the highest risk of dementia, a study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in California split the US into 10 regions and compared dementia rates in each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-ca463c40-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-ca45ee20-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-ca46d880-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as a baseline for comparison because it had the lowest rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed people living in the Southeast - &lt;span&gt;which includes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2890-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tennessee/index.html" id="mol-ca46b170-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alabama/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2891-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mississippi/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2892-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; - were most likely to get dementia with a 25 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were followed closely by northwest states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c0-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c1-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and around the Rocky Mountains were at a 23 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Southwestern states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c2-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; were 13 percent more likely to develop the condition, meanwhile those in northeast states like New York were the least likely - a seven percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), said the disparities are most likely due to socioeconomic factors like quality of education and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14719863/Scientists-discover-toxic-substance-hiding-100-peoples-brains-explains-rise-dementia-US.html"&gt;exposure to environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said while more research is needed, the findings show which areas of the country are most vulnerable to dementia and where efforts should be targeted for education, prevention and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia.

The Southeast was at the greatest risk while Mid-Atlantic was the lowest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kristine Yaffe, senior study author, said: 'The study underscores the need to understand regional differences in dementia and the importance of region-specific prevention and intervention efforts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia and 500,000 are diagnosed every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimate cases will &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;grow by 1million per year by 2060&lt;/a&gt;, while some research suggests 12.7million patients could be diagnosed by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to cases being underreported, a growing aging population and surging rates of diseases like heart disease and obesity, which can weaken blood vessels in the brain and lead to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form with about 6million cases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/embargoed-articles/?_articles=27d58547f7#"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated records from 1.2million veterans over 65 who sought care at a Veterans Affairs (VA) health system between 1999 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used VA data to compare dementia rates among veterans in 10 regions in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants were followed for 13 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 74, and 98 percent were men. About 86 percent were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of dementia diagnosis overall in the US is 83. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team divided participants by 10 geographic regions defined by the CDC: the Northeast, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Southeast, South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, Southwest and Northwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mid-Atlantic - which includes &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d1-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d0-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-3f38b050-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey - was used as a baseline because it had the lowest dementia rate of 11 per 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 14 in every 1,000 participants in the Southeast had dementia, a 25 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northwest - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington state - and Rocky Mountain - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming - both had dementia rates of 13 per 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This put those areas at a 23 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada - the Southwest region - were at a 13 percent increased risk, with a rate of 12 per 1,000. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions were also around 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northeast region had the smallest increase compared to the Mid-Atlantic with a dementia rate of 12 per 1,000 people and a seven percent greater risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers pointed to socioeconomic factors influencing regional risks, especially in southeastern states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christina Dintica, first study author and postdoctoral scholar of psychiatry at UCSF, said: 'Quality of education, early life conditions, and environmental exposures may be among those factors.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States like Kentucky and Mississippi also have high rates of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and obesity, all of which can damage blood vessels in the brain and trigger full-body inflammation that can kill brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also have high concentrations of industrial factories releasing chemicals like heavy metals and gases linked to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Military veterans in general are also at a higher risk of dementia overall due to higher rates of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can damage brain cells and blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some TBIs may also increase amounts of tau and amyloid proteins in the brain, which are known to cause Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also most common in veterans. The condition is thought to trigger inflammation in the brain and damage the brain's memory structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Veterans over 70, such as those in the study, were also more likely to have been exposed to Agent Orange, a mixture of herbicides used by the US military during the Vietnam War. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research suggests people exposed to Agent Orange were twice as likely to develop dementia as those who were not exposed due to inflammation and brain cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study had several limitations, including only focusing on veterans and the vast majority of participants being men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:28:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU</guid></item><item><title>敦促美国人对中国危险菌株引发的新型冠状病毒异常症状保持警惕--《每日邮报》 | Americans urged to stay vigilant for new unusual Covid symptom caused by dangerous Chinese strain - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZS1fbHJ6S05NeUgtSmN1SWR0Y0JqcjNwZDV1RWlpS3lSWlJrM2pSd3YweG1CYUpQaWZVZ3Q2UVBjQk0wZG0zWTl5MlI1MGItVi1RUW5DVE1GcGZFQ3ROUElGdEVXRnNuVUlqMXlFTl9sSHVmanRkM0JBUlFJSGY4cTRVYWc1cVVoYmtvaVFFcUNLR3lrWllzeU9NZGF0Z0VOclJGVHhyZ1RjUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOZVBLbGRRS2d3QzZmemNXQU5Bdi04dlRQaWg0MWhJSlNDTkVxN0Q2aERlMTM4U1R1cW9fTWE3UldiRWlWNjg3S3EweXJhWEswN1VXeHNmY1VaR2VpNzZ3Rk9XZjJiYTl6X1ozRG1ra1hzZ09SYnlIZ0hmY1JkMDZpMXQzRmNncmp2WkFyQ1dHUExaZGZBUEdzVEQ5M3hSVFpidjYxaU5vRHNDQklTQ20w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans are being urged to look out for a distinct symptom caused by a new Covid variant spreading in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple sources say that patients infected with the strain — dubbed NB.1.8.1 — are suffering from a painful sore throat that feels like a 'razor blade' or shattered glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Zhong Nanshan, a leading epidemiologist in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-d97732a0-453b-11f0-83c2-357a39ee5b81" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, told the country's state media that 'razor blade throat' was now more commonly being reported by patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many Chinese citizens are also posting online saying they have been afflicted by the symptom after catching Covid, warning it is painful and leaves them feeling 'completely drained'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the West are now raising awareness about the symptom that is being linked to the variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NB.1.8.1 strain has sent cases surging in China, with the proportion of ER patients testing positive for the virus jumping over one month from 7.5 to 16.2 percent from March to May this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also taking hold in other neighboring countries including India and Thailand, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14773021/doctors-warn-new-covid-virus-china-outbreak.html"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; where the proportion of cases caused by the variant has risen from two percent to 19 percent since April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a dozen cases have also been reported in Washington state, alongside infections in Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization says that early analysis suggests the variant is more infectious, and may now make up half of all cases globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they say there is no evidence that the strain is more likely to cause severe illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients infected with the variant are said to also be reporting other symptoms of a Covid infection similar to previous waves, including a cough, fever, muscle aches and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nanshan told a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.dayoo.com/guangzhou/202505/20/139995_54827416.htm"&gt;state broadcaster&lt;/a&gt;: 'This round of Covid is not much different from the previous ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The early symptoms were similar, including fever, headache, general fatigue, and sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this time, clinical reports showed that the symptoms of razor blade throat were more obvious, and there were more coughs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And posts on the social media platform Weibo by Chinese citizens also reveal individuals are suffering from the symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'During lunchtime a few days ago, a colleague was coughing so wildly I thought she choked on food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She said it was a lingering effect from this Covid wave. When I asked about her main symptom, she said "razor blade throat".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second said: 'I've been hit with razor blade throat, and feel completely drained.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a third added: 'Post-Covid razor blade throat is brutal - swollen, painful, and I can barely speak. Any quick remedies?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The sore throat is described as leaving patients feeling like their throat contains shattered glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The comments are being picked up by doctors in the UK, where the variant has also been detected, and also by the international organization World Health Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Switzerland-based group, which tracks Covid symptoms and variants, said in an alert: 'Commonly reported symptoms include a severe sore throat described as “razor-blade throat fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches, and congestion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for the organization added to DailyMail.com: 'These consistent reports of unusually intense throat pain—distinct from earlier variants—are part of what led us to flag this symptom in our notice. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We continue to monitor both media coverage and direct input from WHN-affiliated clinicians and communities globally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after some physicians in Ohio &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14753459/new-covid-strain-china-experts-face-masks.html"&gt;called for the return of mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; to emulate areas like Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amy Edwards, a pediatrician at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told CBS News last week that anyone who feels 'a little under the weather' should consider masking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another expert calling for masks is Dr Melanie Matheu, an immunologist from California who previously studied at the University of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US test positivity rate — proportion of swabs detecting the virus — rose slightly to 2.8 percent in the week to May 31, the latest available, compared to the previous seven-day spell where it was 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The proportion of ER patients infected with Covid remained at the same level of 0.3 percent of all those admitted over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Covid deaths still appear to be dropping. The latest figure, for the week to May 10, shows 250 deaths were recorded over that seven-day spell compared to 277 in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These levels are far below those in previous Covid periods, including the start of the 2021 wave where the US peaked at reporting 3,700 Covid deaths per day. The test positivity rate reached a high of 13.8 percent in early 2022 amid the start of the Omicron wave of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And are below those reported at the same time last year, when the test positivity rate was 3.5 percent and there were about 344 Covid deaths reported every week. About 0.4 percent of ER visits were also been linked to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:25:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZS1fbHJ6S05NeUgtSmN1SWR0Y0JqcjNwZDV1RWlpS3lSWlJrM2pSd3YweG1CYUpQaWZVZ3Q2UVBjQk0wZG0zWTl5MlI1MGItVi1RUW5DVE1GcGZFQ3ROUElGdEVXRnNuVUlqMXlFTl9sSHVmanRkM0JBUlFJSGY4cTRVYWc1cVVoYmtvaVFFcUNLR3lrWllzeU9NZGF0Z0VOclJGVHhyZ1RjUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOZVBLbGRRS2d3QzZmemNXQU5Bdi04dlRQaWg0MWhJSlNDTkVxN0Q2aERlMTM4U1R1cW9fTWE3UldiRWlWNjg3S3EweXJhWEswN1VXeHNmY1VaR2VpNzZ3Rk9XZjJiYTl6X1ozRG1ra1hzZ09SYnlIZ0hmY1JkMDZpMXQzRmNncmp2WkFyQ1dHUExaZGZBUEdzVEQ5M3hSVFpidjYxaU5vRHNDQklTQ20w</guid></item><item><title>苹果醋对健康有益吗？以下是营养学家的看法- marthastewart.com | Does Apple Cider Vinegar Have Health Benefits?

It's made by &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/pickling-vs-fermenting-8584423#:~:text=Although%20many%20people%20use%20%22pickling,have%20undergone%20a%20chemical%20reaction." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermenting&lt;/a&gt; apple cider, which is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1531892/martha-apple-cider-press-how-to" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;the juice obtained from pressing apples&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does the fermentation process transform the cider into a pungent liquid with a slightly fruity taste, but it’s also thought to add beneficial nutritional features.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result, apple cider vinegar has earned a robust reputation as a popular health food, particularly for gut and digestive health. So much so that it can be found in products like canned or bottled drinks, powders, and gummy or capsule supplements. But on its own, does apple cider vinegar have any advantages for overall wellness, and is it just as good as other fermented foods? To find out, we asked registered dietitians to share insight on the trendy liquid, plus how it can realistically impact your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fermentation process required to make apple cider vinegar involves two steps, according to Elizabeth DeRobertis, MS, RD, CDN, CDE, CPT, registered dietitian and director of the nutrition program at Scarsdale Medical Group, White Plains Hospital. First, yeast turns the sugar in apple cider into alcohol, then bacteria turn that alcohol into acetic acid, the main component of vinegar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the second step, probiotics (i.e., "good" bacteria) begin to grow—but not all apple cider vinegars have these properties, she notes. "Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar has good bacteria, [but] filtered or pasteurized apple cider vinegar is heated, which kills off probiotics," says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before exploring the potential health benefits of apple cider vinegar, it's worth noting that it’s usually consumed in small amounts. That’s because it's commonly used as a flavoring ingredient, rather than a drink like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/benefits-of-kefir-11739412" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt;. (In fact, consuming too much apple cider vinegar at once can irritate the teeth, throat, and stomach, as it’s highly acidic.) With that in mind, apple cider vinegar isn't a magical solution, says DeRobertis. But it may have modest benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease, but some foods—including apple cider vinegar—could lend a hand. "Some small studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may modestly improve cholesterol levels," says Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN, LD/N, FADA, registered dietitian nutritionist, associate professor, and director of nutrition programs at University of South Florida. This includes lowering total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol and raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. “These benefits are thought to be linked to acetic acid, the main active compound in vinegar, which may help reduce fat production in the liver,” per Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The catch? Most of these studies have been small or involved animals, so larger human trials are needed before ACV can be recommended as cholesterol-lowering treatment, says Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Apple cider vinegar contains antioxidants like polyphenols, particularly from the apples used in its production," says Wright. Polyphenols are plant compounds that combat oxidative stress (i.e., cell damage) in the body, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. And while apple cider vinegar isn’t a major source of these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-antioxidant-fruits-11736165" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;—especially when compared to fruits and vegetables—it might still provide a small boost, says Wright.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As apple cider vinegar ferments, it produces "the mother," a cloudy growth that contains probiotics, says Wright. "Probiotics support gut health by helping maintain a balanced microbiome, which is important for digestion, immune function, and mood regulation," she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, since apple cider vinegar is typically consumed in small amounts, it's not considered one of the top fermented foods for gut health, explains Wright. "Other fermented foods like yogurt with live cultures, kefir, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-sauerkraut-11715256" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;, kimchi, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt; contain a much higher and more diverse probiotic content," says Wright. They can also be enjoyed in larger portions, making them more effective in supporting a healthy gut microbiome, she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Control Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat carbohydrates (think bread, rice, pasta, or fruit) your body breaks down these foods into sugar, explains DeRobertis. The sugar enters your blood stream, prompting the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that moves sugar out of the blood and into the cells for energy. For some people, particularly those who are insulin resistant, sugar may stay in the bloodstream longer, potentially causing high blood sugar, says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In these individuals, it's thought that apple cider vinegar may help reduce blood sugar by slowing down digestion or the breakdown of carbs. However, there's currently no solid evidence of this effect, so more research needs to be conducted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Fullness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The potential for apple cider vinegar to slow digestion may also help you feel fuller for longer, says DeRobertis. That's because slowing digestion also reduces how quickly sugar enters the blood, thereby stabilizing blood sugar and preventing energy crashes. Additionally, there's some evidence that acetic acid—which is found in vinegar, including apple cider vinegar—can stimulate a hormone that promotes fullness, but more studies are needed on this, says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-use-apple-cider-vinegar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As mentioned, apple cider vinegar is highly acidic, so it can "irritate the throat, erode tooth enamel, and upset the stomach if taken straight," says Wright. Thus, the vinegar should always be diluted in other ingredients or used in recipes for a tastier experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In water: &lt;/strong&gt;A common way to consume apple cider vinegar is to dilute one to two tablespoons in eight to 10 ounces of water, shares Wright. You can also try it in tea, seltzer, lemonade, or apple cider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire-cider tonic:&lt;/strong&gt; To give your apple cider vinegar a boost, infuse it with anti-inflammatory herbs, spices, honey, and vegetables. The resulting &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1513793/test-kitchens-favorite-fire-cider-tonic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fire-cider tonic&lt;/a&gt; can be mixed in liquid, just like regular apple cider vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad dressings: &lt;/strong&gt;Whip up a &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/336993/basic-vinaigrette" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;basic vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt; with apple cider vinegar, then toss with greens or drizzle over roasted vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies: &lt;/strong&gt;If you enjoy the combination of tangy-sweet flavors, add a splash of apple cider vinegar to your next smoothie. Sweet ingredients like bananas, berries, honey, or dates can help balance the tanginess of the vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marinades: &lt;/strong&gt;When used in marinades, acidic ingredients—including apple cider vinegar—can help soften meats.

The healthcare system failed me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to improve his health and frustrated by how long it had taken to get a diagnosis, Marchione co-founded Superpower in 2022, a healthcare startup that analyzes 100 blood biomarkers, including cholesterol, heavy metals, the stress hormone cortisol and sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More testing done in 2024 using Superpower revealed even scarier health implications. Marchione had the toxins mercury and BPA in his body at levels higher than 99 percent of the US population. And doctors told him he had likely been unknowingly battling these toxins since he was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Max Marchione (pictured here), 25, spent a decade searching for answers behind his insomnia and migraines. He told Daily Mail it took a year to reverse all of his conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione, originally from Australia and now living in San Francisco, said: 'I tried to take things into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a big gap between the best care and what most people have access to. How do you close that gap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone needs access to the best care.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Marchione, Superpower suggested he take 400 milligrams of thiamine pills, also known as vitamin B1, an essential vitamin that turns carbs into energy and promotes healthy nerve function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body can't make vitamin B1 on its own, but it's found in pork, nuts, eggs, trout, black beans, whole grains, kale and cauliflower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low levels of thiamine can lead to severe nervous and cardiovascular system dysfunction, including confusion, memory problems, heart failure, brain swelling, nerve damage and balance issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American needs just one to 1.5 milligrams per day, but research suggests supplementing between 100 and 300 milligrams could help improve prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715873/"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found patients with prediabetes who took 300 milligrams of thiamine daily for six weeks had 11 percent lower glucose levels than those who didn't supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione claims taking 400 milligrams of thiamine every day reversed his prediabetes in three months. Dr Erika Schwartz, a preventative health expert and founder of Vault Science, told the Daily Mail: 'Taking 400 mg of vitamin B1 daily is considered a high dose, but it’s generally safe since any excess is flushed out in urine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplements have now allowed Marchione to occasionally enjoy carb-heavy foods like pasta or pizza without suffering glucose spikes, fatigue or digestive symptoms, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'When I had carbs, they didn't really affect me. But if I went off the vitamin B1, I'd have brain fog and bloating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Schwartz said: 'To truly move the needle, vitamin B1 needs to be paired with a healthy, whole-food diet, balanced hormones, and regular exercise. These lifestyle factors are the real drivers of insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thiamine can support the process — think of it like giving your body better tools to do its job — but it can’t replace the job itself. If you’re eating poorly, staying sedentary, and stressed out, no vitamin will fix that alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; BPA is relatively common in food packaging, cans, and plastic containers despite the well-established deleterious effects that has on the human body, such as infertility certain cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned foods are responsible for 6.6 micrograms per person per day of BPA exposure. When when inside of the cans contain a BPA coating, the harmful chemical seeps into the food itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Superpower also told him to cut out canned foods from his diet, like soup, fish and vegetable oil, as well as some cheeses and sauces, to lower his levels of toxins and heavy metals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant cutting out canned sauces, soups and fish and trying to opt for more minimally processed, whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA, Bisphenol A, is an industrial chemical used in hard plastics and resins to make them more durable. It typically lines plastic and metal food containers and leeches into food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests BPA acts as an 'endocrine disruptor,' meaning it can imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of and response to natural hormones like estrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to hormonal imbalances linked to early puberty, infertility and some reproductive cancers like ovarian cancer, as well as migraines like Marchione's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mercury is a heavy metal that gets deposited in the water and accumulates in fish like swordfish, king mackerel and albacore tuna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no 'safe' level of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watchdog group Environmental Working Group estimates 16,000 foods in the US have BPA in their packaging, and nearly all fish and shellfish have traces of mercury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thiamine, also called vitamin B1, is thought to help lower blood glucose levels and stave off type 2 diabetes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marchione is pictured at left with the other co-founders of Superpower. The membership costs $499 and combines biomarker testing with AI-based solutions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high mercury can lead to headaches and insomnia, similar to what Marchione experienced, due to it attacking the central nervous system and damaging brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione told the Daily Mail his lifestyle changes &lt;span&gt;reversed all of his symptoms within a year and slashed his biological age from 35 to 20 - five years younger than his chronological age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione estimates it took six months to a year to bring his levels back down to a normal range. Once they returned, his debilitating symptoms disappeared and he no longer was prediabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since reversing prediabetes, insomnia, migraines and high toxin levels, Marchione 'never gets sick.' He's now focusing on growing Superpower, which has 200,000 people on a waitlist, and making comprehensive biomarker testing more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Cancer at 50 starts when you're 20. Heart disease at 70 starts when you're 20. Dementia at 80 starts when you're 20. It makes sense to start testing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Testing should be a right and be as low cost as possible' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Brigham Hospital in Boston, who was the study’s lead author, said he was dismayed to find that most of the children’s deaths were homicides and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s surprising how few of these are accidents,” Dr. Faust said. “I always thought that a lot of pediatric mortality from guns is that somebody got into the wrong place, and I still think safe storage is important, but it’s mostly homicides and suicides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;John Commerford, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, called the study “political propaganda masquerading as scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, examined the 13-year period after the June 2010 Supreme Court ruling that the Second Amendment, which protects an individual’s right to bear arms, applies to state and local gun-control laws.

at least once a week, with there being a direct correlation with happiness, according to participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alexandra Janssen, a researcher at the University of Manchester, is the author behind the recent study and she pointed out the importance of regular sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The study found that women who were getting intimate more often, were happier (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It was found that 85 percent of women who had sex every week were 'sexually satisfied', said the survey, which accumulated the results from almost 500 heterosexual women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/weddings"&gt;wives&lt;/a&gt; and girlfriends who did the dirty just once a month, only 66 percent were as happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While it's not a huge drop-off, it's noticeable enough to take some notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If we go on to women who had sex less than once a month, the satisfaction level dropped to a dangerously low 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/35297660/women-sex-happiest-health/"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen time creates a vicious cycle—kids with emotional problems turn to devices for comfort, but screens can make those problems worse over time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gaming is the biggest concern, showing much stronger negative effects than watching TV or educational content, especially for older children aged 6-10.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The solution isn’t eliminating screens entirely, but being aware when devices become the automatic response to emotional distress instead of real-world coping strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYDNEY —&lt;/strong&gt; Your 8-year-old has a meltdown, so you hand them an iPad to calm down. It’s a move countless parents have made, but new research reveals this common solution might be creating a troubling problem that feeds on itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study led by scientists at Australian Catholic University tracking nearly 300,000 children over several years concludes that screen time doesn’t just cause emotional and behavioral problems in kids, it also becomes their go-to coping mechanism when they’re struggling. Screens both &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;create problems&lt;/a&gt; and become the solution kids reach for, forming what researchers call a “vicious cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000468.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, represents the largest analysis ever conducted on how screen use affects children’s emotional development over time. Rather than simply labeling screens as good or bad, it reveals something far more nuanced about how our digital world is reshaping childhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Screen use may increase the risk of children developing socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems may be drawn to screens, possibly as a way &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/digital-pacifiers-children-emotional-anger-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to manage their distress&lt;/a&gt;,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaming-proves-most-problematic-for-kids"&gt;Gaming Proves Most Problematic for Kids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Video games&lt;/a&gt; emerged as the biggest concern in the study. Children who played games were significantly more likely to develop emotional and behavioral issues later on. But here’s the troubling part: kids who already had these problems were even more drawn to gaming than other screen activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When children used screens for gaming, the effects were much stronger than when they used screens for general entertainment like watching TV. Gaming also showed the strongest tendency for troubled kids to seek out this particular screen activity when looking for relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents who carefully curate educational content for their toddlers while allowing unlimited gaming for their older children might want to reconsider their approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-older-children-face-higher-risks-than-expected"&gt;Older Children Face Higher Risks Than Expected&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, older children (ages 6-10) were actually more susceptible to screen-related problems than younger ones (ages 0-5). The reason appears to be autonomy: older children have more control over their screen choices and more opportunities to use devices as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/teen-screen-time-scrolling-mental-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional escape routes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 3-year-old might watch whatever parents put on, but a 7-year-old can actively seek out games or videos when feeling upset, angry, or anxious. Gender differences also emerged, with girls showing stronger negative reactions to general screen use, while boys in the older age group were more likely to develop problems from heavy gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-cost-of-screen-time"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Screen Time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every hour a child spends gaming or watching videos is an hour not spent developing social skills with friends, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/chldren-screen-time-heart-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being physically active&lt;/a&gt;, or learning to manage emotions through real-world experiences. Researchers call this the “displacement effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a typical scenario: A 9-year-old feels frustrated about a bad day at school. Instead of talking to parents, going outside, or finding another healthy outlet, they retreat to their room with a tablet. The screen provides immediate relief, but the child never learns better coping strategies. Meanwhile, they miss out on the kind of parent-child interaction that actually builds emotional &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 117 separate studies spanning multiple countries and cultures, tracking children for periods ranging from six months to several years. They measured both screen use and various emotional and behavioral problems like aggression, anxiety, depression, and attention issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study design — following the same children over time rather than just taking snapshots — allowed researchers to see which comes first: the screen problems or the emotional problems. The effects, while statistically small, were consistent across studies. Screens aren’t single-handedly destroying childhood, but they’re contributing to problems in measurable ways that parents and policymakers should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle starts with awareness. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parents who recognize&lt;/a&gt; that their emotionally struggling child might be self-medicating with screens can intervene more thoughtfully. This might mean addressing underlying anxiety or behavioral issues directly, rather than just limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that some screen use, particularly educational content viewed with parents, shows little to no harmful effects. The problem isn’t screens themselves, but how they’re being used to fill emotional voids that might be better addressed through human connection and real-world experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For parents feeling overwhelmed by another study about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;screen time dangers&lt;/a&gt;, the message isn’t that you need to throw all devices out the window. Instead, it’s a call to be more aware of the patterns in your own home: when screens become the automatic solution to emotional distress, and what gets displaced in the process. Unlike many childhood challenges, this is one where parents still hold most of the control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 117 longitudinal studies that tracked children over time. The analysis included data from 292,739 children from various countries, with follow-up periods ranging from six months to several years. The team used advanced statistical modeling called “cross-lagged panel analysis” to determine whether screen use led to emotional problems, emotional problems led to more screen use, or both. Studies had to meet strict criteria: children had to be under 10.5 years old at the start, researchers had to measure both screen use and validated emotional/behavioral problems, and studies had to follow children for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research found small but significant bidirectional effects: screen use predicted later socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems increased their screen use over time. Gaming showed much stronger effects in both directions compared to other screen activities. Older children (ages 6-10) were more susceptible than younger ones (ages 0-5), and effects were stronger when children exceeded recommended screen time limits. Children using screens above guideline recommendations showed meaningful associations with later problems, while those meeting guidelines showed minimal effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most studies relied on parent or self-reported screen time rather than objective measurements, which can be inaccurate. The research was predominantly conducted in Western countries with limited racial and ethnic diversity. Very few studies examined newer devices like smartphones and tablets specifically. The effects found were generally small, and the studies couldn’t control for all possible confounding factors like parenting style or family stress. Additionally, many individual studies had methodological limitations such as high dropout rates or lack of preregistration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors reported no specific funding for this work and declared no conflicts of interest. The research was conducted by an international team from universities in Australia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, the United States, and other countries. All data and analysis code are publicly available through the Open Science Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer is yes. &lt;a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/cheap-and-healthy-sources-of-protein/" target="_self"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is not only necessary for gym buffs and bodybuilders -- it's essential for everyone. In addition to building muscle, protein helps with weight loss, energy levels, balancing hormones and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Your protein needs will vary based on factors like body weight and activity level. A general guideline from the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096" target="_self"&gt;recommended dietary allowance for protein&lt;/a&gt; is 0.36 grams per pound of body weight per day.

If you ate all of this in a day, plus bread and other nonanimal products, you would surpass 100 grams of protein in a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What 100 grams of protein looks like for vegetarians &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Amanda Capritto/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For vegetarians, 100 grams of protein might look like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four eggs (24 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup of rolled oats (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two snack cheeses (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;¼ cup of protein granola (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single-serve Greek yogurt (15 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes out to 99 grams of protein, which is pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What 100 grams of protein looks like for vegans &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Amanda Capritto/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see isn't totally what you get with the amount of protein here: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 ounce of nuts (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup of rolled oats (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A protein granola bar (8 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two slices of rye bread (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;¼ cup of protein granola (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of chia seeds (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This amounts to 79 grams of protein. If we double up on the mixed nuts, chia seeds and hemp seeds, this brings us to 93 grams of protein. You could add an extra tablespoon of peanut butter or eat a full cup of oats, instead of half a cup, to come closer to 100 grams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plate also excludes high-protein vegan meat substitutes, such as tofu, tempeh or plant-based meats like the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/impossible-burger-everything-you-need-to-know/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impossible Burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Ultimately, researchers predicted that those with HSV-1 and a specific gene, called the ApoE-e4 gene, had a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston, &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System; and &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Ruth Itzhaki, Ph.D., summarized her team’s findings in a recent article for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/thirty-years-on-our-research-linking-viral-infections-with-alzheimers-is-finally-getting-the-attention-it-deserves-254656" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and noted that, over the years, additional work has surfaced to support hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does it all mean, exactly? If a cold sore pops up, should you be concerned about dementia? We reached out to experts who explained everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is a common virus to which almost everyone is exposed early in life,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston. “It is best known for causing cold sores and is closely related to chicken pox and mononucleosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these viruses have in common is that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/neurotropism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurotropic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurotropic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they linger in the nervous system long after the initial illness, explains &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System, and can be reactivated by stress or lowered immunity. That’s how, for instance, chicken pox can manifest later in life as shingles, adds Dr. Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus’s ability to infiltrate the nerves is believed to get it past the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that shields the organ from infection via the bloodstream. Thanks to that entry point, Dr. Hunter says, HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral brain inflammation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no vaccine for HSV and almost everyone will get it by adulthood,” Dr. Hunter adds. Cold sores are a mild case of it, and symptoms can be treated with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s may be connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant HSV-1 may be reactivated by illness and reach the brain, explains &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada. This can trigger brain inflammation over time, known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes encephalitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;herpes encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;and in people with genetic risk factors, like the ApoE-4 gene, contribute to Alzheimer’s development, he adds. “We don’t entirely know why ApoE-4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s,” adds Dr. Hunter. “The link to HSV could be that ApoE-4 impacts the blood-brain barrier and makes it easier for HSV to enter.” And the inflammation caused by that entry may heighten Alzheimer’s risk. “It is now universally accepted that inflammation in the brain is a key step in the development of Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Hunter reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What experts think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three decades since the original study, doctors and researchers have learned much more about Alzheimer’s disease and its connection to viral inflammation. For instance, several &lt;a href="https://www.uth.edu/news/story/several-vaccines-associated-with-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adults-65-and-older" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that being immunized for any disease (like COVID-19 or the flu) reduces Alzheimer’s risk, says Dr. Hunter. “Several other studies have shown that reducing inflammation in the brain helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos concurs. “Since 1996, additional studies have found HSV-1 DNA in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. Lab studies have also shown that HSV-1 infection can trigger the buildup of amyloid-beta and tau—proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few disclaimers to note. Firstly, the posed risk is associated with people who contract HSV-1 in early life, giving it time to progressively cause inflammation. The risk may be lower in adults, says Santos. “That said, if someone has other risk factors (like a weakened immune system or APOE-e4), adult-onset HSV-1 could still have long-term consequences,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, neurotropic viruses are extremely common, Dr. Yancey reiterates. “This makes it difficult to tease out whether they are causing neurologic problems or are simply common in the general population, including people with neurologic problems,” she adds. In other words, because most people end up with HSV-1 doesn’t necessarily mean that most people will get Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cold sores aren’t a cause for concern,” Santos adds. “They’re common and usually well-controlled by the immune system. But for people with frequent outbreaks, weakened immunity, or APOE-e4, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider. The concern is not a single cold sore, but long-term viral activity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including long-term studies, is needed to make any solid associations, Santos and Dr. Yancey conclude. “The current data is based on population-level surveys. There is no way to predict on an individual patient’s level whether this has a meaningful impact,” says Dr. Yancey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will, hopefully, at least help experts understand how antiviral treatment affects Alzheimer’s risk, as well as identify better ways to detect when HSV-1 is active in the brain. “The hope is that understanding how infections contribute to Alzheimer’s will open up new ways to prevent or treat it—especially before symptoms start,” says Santos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle choices that may help lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated, exercising, engaging in mental stimulation, and maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g33416014/heart-healthy-food-wd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; are all known ways to lower dementia risk, our experts say. Avoiding smoking or nicotine use of any kind can also “drastically” reduce the risk, says Dr. Yancey. All of these habits and choices work together to support both immune and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:18:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1LVjlfbG1Vbl8zeDlrZklBWjRvdkxLWGN1dmpzLUZVTE1vOXRNOGoyY1lPMTE4cGduTXNoU3JLenZ1SzhoNnBYVl9qMEVLZmU1MDhhdFU4SXhXenBpOWt5cGFxTGVMeWQ3amw3aW9VdVI5UkFxXzZBa0dtMmZqV1U</guid></item><item><title>“服用Mounjaro后，我的生活崩溃了” ：女性揭示了从中开始的刺拳的令人不安的副作用-每日邮报 | 'After taking Mounjaro, my life fell apart': Women reveal disturbing side effects from jab that started within - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women have reported terrifying mental health side effects after taking Mounjaro—the popular weight-loss injection used by thousands of people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some describe sudden panic attacks, crippling anxiety and a sensation of 'tugging in the brain' after starting the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro, along with similar treatments such as Ozempic and Wegovy, can help dieters lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 1.5 million Britons used weight-loss jabs in March 2025 alone—and the new wave of jabs have been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But growing numbers of patients say they have experienced unexpected mental health symptoms—including insomnia, tremors, shortness of breath and tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although these are not currently listed as official side effects for any of the three major jabs in the UK, an online support group for users suffering such symptoms has attracted more than 2,800 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three members—speaking anonymously to The Times—described the onset of debilitating anxiety, sleeplessness and panic attacks after starting Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One said the anxiety felt like a kind of 'terror' she had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cases have prompted fresh questions over the safety profile of the medications as their use becomes more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Like a switch had been flipped in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Things got worse when she was hit by a series of panic attacks and tremors for five weeks—which she likened to 'swallowing an earthquake'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went into a constant state of fight-or-flight—like a bad drug trip that wouldn't end. I couldn't see how I was going to be able to survive it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially signed off work unable to 'do anything' or even 'follow a conversation', she later resigned with her relationship ending that same week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman who said her life 'just fell apart', said: 'The way I see it, it's a roll of the dice as to how you're going to react to these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If people knew that they could have potentially catastrophic mental and physical side-effects, they could make a more informed decision about taking them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Lloyd isn't the only one experiencing psychological side effects—another woman also found herself in A&amp;amp;E after taking the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Edwards, ended up in hospital last year only 48 hours after taking her first dose of the Mounjaro jab.&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/after-taking-weight-loss-drugs-my-life-fell-apart-g76cd9bkc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When her BMI was over 30, so she too qualified for the weight loss jab which got from the online doctor, MedExpress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought I was having a heart attack,' she said, but her scans, x-trays and bloods taken, all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had any mental health problems. I've never had a panic attack or anxiety. I've always been a laid-back person and now it's like everything is stressful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get this thing that we've termed 'air hunger' where it's like I can't take a deep breath. If I'd have known Mounjaro could have mental health side-effects I never would have taken it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third woman, Julie Peters, a 31 year-old mother from Birmingham had a similar experience after getting the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a panic attack that lasted two hours on January 11, after taking the lowest dose, 2.5mg, of Mounjaro, once a week for two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother went to A&amp;amp;E also thinking she was having a heart attack, but similarly she said: 'tests on my heart, kidneys, and for pancreatitis all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Peters also described experiencing tremors, a 'tugging' sensation in her brain' and tinnitus—'The ringing in my ears has been constant, sometimes with multiple ringing sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pressure and heaviness in my brain make me feel dull, disconnected and nauseous, and I also have a sensitivity to motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently requested a brain MRI, and while the results came back normal, I am relieved yet uncertain about what to do next. It's incredibly suffocating,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10960895/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in January last year in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy which found 481 psychiatric events were linked to weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'seriousness of the adverse events warrants additional research' to explore the causual relationship,' said lead authors, Hajer Elkout and Mansour Tobaiqy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was despite psychiatric events only accounting for 1.2 per cent of total reports associated with the active ingredients in weight loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anxiety, depression nor insomnia were listed as potential side effects by Asda Online Doctor by Zava or in the patient leaflet they refer patients to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinical governance team at the private pharmacist who stressed patient safety told The Times all applicants are required to give their medical history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes their GP details which they said enables the GP to inform them 'of any discrepancies or concerns they have with the prescription'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added there are studies evidencing mental health can be improved with treatment, and no clinical-based-evidence of a negative impact 'they are aware of'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal of Natural Medicine found taking semaglutide for weight loss or diabetes reduced the incidence of suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14643325/harmful-effects-Ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html"&gt;more recent study&lt;/a&gt; found Ozempic and Mounjaro can raise the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Asda Online Doctor by Zava added: 'Our doctors, of course, will provide suitable advice to any particular patients of concern or who are managing complex mental health issues and may not be able to use the treatment appropriately alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients, where necessary, will be signposted to their GPs for further support to manage their weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The manufacturers of Mounjaro, Eli Lilly, and of both Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk told The Times patient safety was their top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take any reports about patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines,' said Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With Novo Nordisk adding it welcomes: 'Independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two drug companies both highlighted that the UK regulatory agency had assessed the risk and benefits approving their respective drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk added that independent analysis 'did not find an association between use of GLP-1RA medicines and the occurrence of increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement a plan to expand access to optimized supportive clinical care for all patients with mpox, including children, pregnant women, and persons living with HIV, recognising the association of mpox-related morbidity and mortality in persons living with HIV with untreated or advanced HIV. This includes prompt identification and effective management of endemic co-infections, such as malaria, chickenpox or measles. This also includes offering HIV tests to adult patients who do not know their HIV status and to children as appropriate, testing and treatment for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among cases linked to sexual contact and referral to HIV/STIs treatment and care services when indicated. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen health and care workers’ capacity, knowledge and skills in clinical and infection and prevention and control pathways – screening, diagnosis, isolation, environmental cleaning, discharge of patients, including post discharge follow up for suspected and confirmed mpox –, and provide health and care workers with personal protective equipment (PPE). (EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and availability of water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and waste management services and infrastructure in healthcare facilities and treatment and care centers to ensure quality healthcare service delivery and protection of health and care workers, caregivers and patients.

(EXTENDED, with rephrasing and updated reference)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement plans for vaccination in the context of an integrated response at the lowest administrative level reporting cases for people at high risk of exposure (e.g., contacts of cases of all ages, health and frontline workers, and other groups at risk such as those with multiple sexual partners and sex workers in endemic and non-endemic areas). This entails a targeted integrated response, including active surveillance and contact tracing; agile adaptation of immunization strategies and plans to the local context including dose-sparing options (single dose/fractional dosing) in the context of limited availability of vaccines; proactive community engagement to generate and sustain demand for and trust in vaccination; close monitoring of mpox vaccination activities, coverage and adverse events following immunization (AEFI); assessment of vaccine effectiveness; and documenting lessons learned and their implementation. (MODIFIED)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen risk communication and community engagement in affected communities and local workforces for outbreak prevention, response and vaccination strategies, particularly at the lowest administrative levels reporting cases. Key actions include training, mapping high risk and vulnerable populations for tailored interventions, data driven approaches for social listening, community feedback and dialogue, and managing misinformation. This entails, inter alia, communicating effectively the uncertainties and new information regarding the natural history of mpox and modes of transmission, the effectiveness of mpox vaccines and duration of protection following vaccination, and about any clinical trials to which the local population may have access, as appropriate. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address stigma and discrimination of any kind via meaningful community engagement, particularly in health services and during risk communication activities, and through engagement with civil society groups, such as HIV networks. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote and implement IPC measures and basic WASH and waste management services in household settings, congregate settings (e.g. prisons, internally displaced persons and refugee camps, etc.), schools, points of entry and cross border transit areas. (EXTENDED)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance and financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galvanize and scale up national funding and explore external opportunities for targeted funding of mpox prevention, readiness and response activities, advocate for release of available funds and take steps to identify potential new funding partners for emergency response. (EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimize the use of resources, in the context of global and local external funding shortfalls, by allocating available resources to the implementation of core mpox response interventions needed in the medium term; maximizing their cost-efficiency through cross-programmatic synergetic approaches; and by engaging partners in resource-sharing arrangements to maintain the delivery of essential health services. (NEW)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrate mpox prevention and response measures, including enhanced surveillance, in existing programmes for prevention, control and treatment of other endemic diseases – especially HIV, as well as STIs, malaria, tuberculosis and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and/or non-communicable diseases – striving to identify activities which will benefit the programmes involved and lead to better health outcomes overall. (EXTENDED)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing research gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invest in field studies to better understand animal hosts and zoonotic spillover in the areas where MPXV is circulating, in coordination with the animal health sector and One Health partners. (EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen and expand use of genomic sequencing to characterize the epidemiology and chains of transmission of MPXV to better inform control measures, particularly regarding the emergence and circulation of new virus strains. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting on the implementation of temporary recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report quarterly to WHO on the status of, and challenges related to, the implementation of these temporary recommendations, using a revised standardized tool and channels that will be made available by WHO, also allowing for the monitoring of progress and the identification of gaps of the national response.

Anxious attachment, marked by insecurity and low self-esteem in relationships, was associated with worse sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the link between poor sleep and jealousy only held true for individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety. These findings suggest that a person’s attachment style may influence how sleep impacts emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attachment and Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxious attachment correlates with poorer sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Jealousy:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep increases daily jealousy only in those with attachment anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding attachment style can help tailor sleep and relationship interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that poor sleep quality is related to relationship insecurity, which moderates the effect of sleep quality on daily feelings of jealousy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that anxious attachment, which involves difficulties with trust and low self-esteem in relationships, was related to poorer sleep quality. The study also found that poor sleep quality was associated with more daily feelings of jealousy, but this effect was only significant for those with high levels of attachment anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, poor sleep wasn’t uniformly related to all negative socioemotional outcomes,” said Giovanni Alvarado, lead author and doctoral candidate at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that attachment style might shape which emotions are most affected by sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, sleep is essential to health. The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. In addition to adequate duration, healthy sleep requires good quality, appropriate timing and regularity, and the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 68 young adults who completed questionnaires about sleep and relationships. They also completed daily self-reports capturing experiences of social emotions and behaviors over a two-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Alvarado, the study underscores the complex link between sleep and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with anxious attachment, or those who struggle with insecurity in relationships, may be especially vulnerable to feelings of envy and jealousy when they’re sleep deprived,” said Alvarado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This helps us understand why some individuals may have more difficulty navigating social situations when they’re tired and could inform more targeted interventions that consider an individual’s relationship style when addressing sleep issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and jealousy research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Miller – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at SLEEP 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:55:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5XaEVZbUpYLURwWWJJeUNvckp5bzR5V1F3UkR0ZHEwYjhuM0pSd1ZqUzliamZqRDEwa3JncDV3Mzh1QUZUeTRwLTlwdkZfekY2ZUpIdmhQYTc1eEV1dmtQRHd0VmE0RmRfQmpaOXB3</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家发现“既对抗又助长”乳腺癌的免疫细胞-以色列时报 | Israeli scientists discover immune cells that ‘both fight and fuel’ breast cancer - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNSkhURWFFckM0aWY1b0NROU1oaWQzQUYxa2JqTmN0LXRkZm5NaURDTEFLdE81MktvQ254elNKalNQRHY2bFQ2RzI2UFU2NUtOTC1UMjdSa0RIQnlHR05hQ0tYb0VCNmpsc0ROWDFsN1Z4NDB1OGFzXzd4aVN3LXVzN1huNmZwN0dSTEVZYjJLR3diMUFwUkxOUV9XR2t2dHpTNFgzallaUHR0Um16bUpn0gG0AUFVX3lxTE9nUHZMaVRwSVNiTUVVc1JLVnBWelRldV95WEN6X19PTkUwaHVVYzRXLW5JVUhQbHhtNU1URFVwRUVJZVpsYzN5VTU0ZzVmVnlJRkFJSW9uM2lQTy1qUWltRkc5bjl4TDhqdHRsdkRLUE5aWXZ3Z2RLTmw4UXNrRXJXUk9GV1FuaW5YZW4xYl9jamFMUVBFUHg4dTlMSVhrMU1JSDlsXzdySkFEekVKb29ldkxBTg</guid></item><item><title>为什么有些人在噪音中比其他人听得更好-神经科学新闻 | Why Some People Hear Better in Noise Than Others - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1WVTVfTVNKU0U3ck9IRUF4Q0V2LXBsblAxUVpYM2tXUlduWElsYkU4cV9vWVcwVThZbkVxSHpkQWFXY3hIRlNSMVJLTnRINnd6NFh4QmhnQVplNFZWMFpPaWczTmc0SXhtejk3TGVkYmZxd1Jy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large-scale international study has confirmed that the ability to detect background sounds varies significantly from person to person and depends on the preceding noise. By replicating a 10-year-old study with 149 participants across 25 labs in 10 countries, researchers found consistent results supporting the original findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People’s sensitivity to detecting a signal amid noise is not only variable but influenced by what sounds they heard just before. This foundational research helps explain why some individuals struggle more than others to follow conversations in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; People’s ability to detect sounds in noise varies widely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; What was heard just before affects perception of later sounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings could inform hearing diagnostics and therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northeastern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study led by Northeastern University professor Jonathan Peelle with researchers from across the globe has confirmed that people’s ability to detect background sounds varies from person to person, and is influenced by the noise that came before the sounds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peelle’s large-scale replication of a 10-year-old study involved 25 labs across 10 countries and included 149 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110763"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people in a noisy cafe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/hearing-difference-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also showed that different people have different levels of ability when it comes to gauging this. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago, a research paper suggested that some people are better at picking out background sounds than others, and that this ability depends on the surrounding noise. But the study’s findings were based on data from just five participants, each completing a five-hour task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peelle, a professor of communication sciences and disorders at Northeastern, wanted to see if he could expand this study and understand how listeners understand speech in noise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a fundamental part of hearing and how we perceive the world,” said Peelle, who studies how people understand speech in noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that people’s perception is affected by that was really intriguing and tied into a whole bunch of other ideas about how we hear and understand speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers had the same reaction as Peelle when this study came out and wanted to try to expand on it. But he found people who tried to replicate the original study had struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing a replication would need to involve other labs given the scale, he and his team opened up the project to other research teams around the world. They also worked through the original paper and spoke with the team behind it to make sure they had all the details needed to replicate the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got their sounds and their code to really understand what they did and if we were doing anything differently,” Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we were convinced it was working, we put out a call for other labs to participate and … we were able to do a much more comprehensive job. In the end, we figured out some reasons why we weren’t able to replicate their study, and the main findings did stand up. But we had to jump over a lot of hurdles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had participants complete a series of tests over the course of five sessions that involved listening to a sequence of noises that would get louder or softer, Peelle said. The noise would then hit a steady volume and a beep would come in. Participants would have to indicate when they heard the beep, which appeared half the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to determine at what point people can start distinguishing certain sounds and make sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original study authors did share their code and data, so the study could be as closely replicated as possible, down to what buttons people had to press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to think about this is if you’re in a noisy coffee shop and you’re having trouble hearing a person you’re having a conversation with, it’s easier for some of their words to break through to your consciousness than others,” Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a really simplified version of that task. We’re just asking, did you detect a beep and noise? If we can better understand  how our brains are understanding this really simple thing, it may then tell us more about how we have conversations in a coffee shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expanded study confirmed the results of the original: people’s ability to perceive sounds does change depending on what they just heard. The study also showed that different people have different levels of ability when it comes to gauging this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people are much more sensitive to this effect than others, which is potentially useful if we want to use this as a clinical diagnostic tool,” he said. “We know that there’s variability and effect. There are some people who don’t really seem to (show) this effect very much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on a larger scale, the study also showed the value of collaboration, Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The exciting part to me was the collaborative nature of science (and) how enthusiastic people were to help out with this,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to get 25 teams from 10 countries to help out and pull together this kind of big group effort. We have 69 authors on the paper that we had to coordinate, and in the end, I feel like we came out with a much better product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this auditory neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erin Kayata&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northeastern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Erin Kayata  – Northeastern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be published in &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:30:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1WVTVfTVNKU0U3ck9IRUF4Q0V2LXBsblAxUVpYM2tXUlduWElsYkU4cV9vWVcwVThZbkVxSHpkQWFXY3hIRlNSMVJLTnRINnd6NFh4QmhnQVplNFZWMFpPaWczTmc0SXhtejk3TGVkYmZxd1Jy</guid></item><item><title>消耗空腹以自然稳定血糖水平的5种食物-印度时报 | 5 foods to consume empty stomach to stabilize blood sugar levels naturally - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxPUm1EcFowM3haNnBCM2w1NTFidV9oZ18tek5mcmU4VG43bDVKUUN4Q1ZfNW5GWU5DUldLaWMwd3ZNVjIyc2VETVZjNFN0UUNNS1RrbkJDbzhPRUVBNm9MM0RiUDl0cGVIcjMyYlE5Vl9zOGFoSnJtajNYUnlIWndMTnE0U2d0cENQZXNkZW9wT3NLR0hoRmF4Vk9qclVHVWlON0FlQi1KTUpZS1JBR08xOThBOGliYXV1V0pYRXpPWVBwb1FiT25PeW1veTNtSTZfSzRjX19iemNPUzNKLXlxT2JVbVM2Yk1WT1pReA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“1 cup hot water with 1 tsp fenugreek seeds: boosts insulin sensitivity and controls blood sugar spikes,” Rajat concludes.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of Canada is ablaze again, with more than 200 active wildfires having consumed roughly 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) since January, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ciffc.net/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Thursday, June 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This escalating situation pumped massive amounts of smoke across the Canada-U.S. border, affecting air quality as far south as Florida, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/noaa-satellites-monitor-canadian-wildfires-and-smoke"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (NOAA). As climate change &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lengthens and intensifies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season in many regions across the world, understanding the dangers of smoke exposure is increasingly important. A wave of new research paints a complex picture of how wildfire smoke impacts the body, linking it to startling health outcomes that go far beyond the respiratory system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is an urgent need for research to fully understand the health impacts of wildfire smoke to raise awareness among public and health professionals, as well as to support the development of effective regulations to mitigate the impacts,” Yaguang Wei, assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, recently told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/06/wildfire-smoke-can-harm-heart-and-lungs-even-after-the-fire-has-ended/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harvard Gazette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wei is the lead author of a new study, published in May in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/9900/medium_term_exposure_to_wildfire_smoke_pm2_5_and.374.aspx"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that wildfire smoke can damage the lungs and heart for up to three months after the fire is out. He and his colleagues linked this “medium-term” exposure to increased risks of various cardiorespiratory conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, and asthma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even brief exposures from smaller fires that last only a few days can lead to long-lasting health effects,” Wei told the Harvard Gazette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Infectious fumes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wildfire smoke is a mixture of gases, air pollutants, water vapor, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/why-wildfire-smoke-health-concern"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (EPA). It contains significant levels of toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some of which are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality"&gt;&lt;span&gt;known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/risk/other-carcinogenic-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons#:~:text=List%20of%20carcinogenic%20polycyclic%20aromatic,other%20than%20benzo%5Ba%5Dpyrene"&gt;&lt;span&gt;carcinogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Recent studies even suggest that wildfire smoke carries microbial and fungal pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One such study, published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00788-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ISME Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2021, noted that 80% of microbes found in wildfire smoke samples were still viable. While it’s still unclear how these organisms survive the extremely high temperatures in wildfires, researchers do have an idea of how they get into the smoke in the first place. George Thompson, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study, told Gizmodo that wildfires pull pathogens from the surrounding soil and vegetation as they draw in air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00046-3/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lancet, Planetary Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associated California wildfires with an 18% to 22% increase in invasive fungal infections such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;valley fever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Thompson pointed out that the study was based on large hospital data, which is “a great start,” but further research will need to corroborate this link. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain on fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most hazardous component of wildfire smoke is not pathogens, but PM2.5. These minuscule particles penetrate deep inside the lungs and wreak havoc on the respiratory system. Previous research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456361/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the tiniest, ultrafine particles can pass from the lungs directly into the bloodstream. This can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/40/20/1590/5372326"&gt;&lt;span&gt;damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; blood vessels and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250783/#:~:text=Translocated%20particles%20as%20well%20as,%2C%20and%20chronic%20heart%20failure)."&gt;&lt;span&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; harmful inflammation and oxidative stress in various organs, including the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiple studies have associated wildfire smoke exposure with incidence of dementia. Last year, research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1.2 million Southern Californians aged 60 and older, and found a significant link between long-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and a heightened risk of dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, every 1 microgram per cubic meter increase in the three-year average of wildfire PM2.5 raised the odds of a dementia diagnosis by 18%. In comparison, the same increase in PM2.5 from non-wildfire sources was linked to only a 1% greater risk of developing dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was expecting for us to see an association between wildfire smoke exposure and dementia,” lead author Holly Elser, an epidemiologist and resident physician in neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-29/study-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk-more-than-other-pollutants"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Los Angeles Times in 2024. “But the fact we see so much stronger of an association for wildfire as compared to non-wildfire smoke exposure was kind of surprising.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Psychological fallout &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other studies have linked wildfire smoke to adverse psychological outcomes. Research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832210"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in April analyzed data on wildfire PM2.5 levels and mental health-related emergency department visits throughout California between July and December 2022—the state’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020#:~:text=911%20Translate%20Settings-,2020,Search:"&gt;&lt;span&gt;worst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season on record. The study found that wildfire smoke correlated with a significant spike in mental health emergency department visits for up to seven days post-exposure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our study suggests that—in addition to the trauma a wildfire can induce—smoke itself may play a direct role in worsening mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and mood disorders,” co-author Kari Nadeau, a physician-scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-linked-with-worsening-mental-health-conditions/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions remain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this research demonstrates that wildfire smoke is more than just a respiratory hazard. But experts are still in the early stages of unraveling its complex health impacts—particularly in terms of mental health, Angela Yao, a senior scientist with the Environmental Health Services at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Canada, told Gizmodo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many questions remain unanswered, she said. For example, “How do you disentangle the impact of smoke from the impact of the fire itself?” Future studies will need to investigate these confounding factors. But, “even with the current evidence that we have—it already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gives us confidence that we should take a lot of action,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To protect yourself from the hazards of wildfire smoke, Yao recommended limiting the length and intensity of time spent outdoors. “The harder you breathe, the more smoke you inhale,” she said. If you must go outside, wearing an N95 mask or a P100 can reduce your smoke exposure, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/documents/respiratory_protection-no-niosh-5081.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep windows and doors shut to ensure that your indoor air is safe. It’s also important to make sure your home’s HVAC system is running properly, Yao added. If you don’t have one, you can purchase a portable air filter or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; your own using a furnace filter and a box fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As wildfire season becomes increasingly impactful, taking steps to protect yourself and your family from smoke has never been more critical. Experts still have a long way to go towards fully understanding the risks of wildfire exposure, but one thing is clear—these hazards aren’t going away any time soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists have uncovered a surprising fungus that incorporates gold into its structure in soils where trace particles of this metal occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery raises eyebrows because gold rarely reacts with living organisms. It caught everyone’s attention when researchers noticed bits of gold attached to the microscopic strands of the fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/fungi-hidden-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt; are the fine, thread-like filaments that help fungi absorb nutrients. In the case of this fungus, they seem capable of interacting with gold through metabolism in ways many believed to be nearly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gold is so chemically inactive that this type of interaction is unusual and surprising,” remarked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=7_x-MfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tsing Bohu&lt;/a&gt;, the lead researcher at &lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2019/may/gold-coated-fungi-are-the-new-gold-diggers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discovering-gold-eating-fungus"&gt;Discovering gold-eating fungus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bohu and his colleagues at CSIRO, first observed that the fungus grows faster and appears healthier when gold attaches to its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts think these findings could help geologists detect underground gold deposits through more targeted surveys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration companies have historically analyzed plants, soils, and even water to locate gold-rich areas, but the use of gold-seeking fungi opens the door for a more focused approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have been obsessed with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/couple-finds-a-gold-nugget-measuring-7-inches-across-weighing-more-than-9-pounds/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for centuries because of its scarcity and status in global markets. It is essential in medical devices, smartphones, and numerous other technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/supergiant-gold-deposit-find-claims-to-be-the-worlds-largest-discovery-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effort to mine gold&lt;/a&gt; comes with challenges, including large excavation sites and water-intensive processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new fungal method could reduce environmental pressures because it taps into the natural processes of living organisms rather than relying on large-scale digging or harsh chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-gold-fungus-stands-out"&gt;Why this “gold fungus” stands out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus studied by the Australian team belongs to strains similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fusarium-oxysporum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been reported to transform inorganic particles through metabolic pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pathways allow gold to accumulate in or on the fungal filaments over time. The fungus in question draws energy from its surroundings in ways that encourage gold accumulation, though researchers are still pinpointing the precise enzymes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intriguing strain called &lt;a href="https://www.mycobank.org/details/708/105304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida rugopelliculosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been noted for producing gold nanoparticles through a stress response when exposed to certain gold compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that these microorganisms release specific &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt; and proteins to reduce the metal ions and keep the resulting gold in stable nanoparticle form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological trick could be a big win for miners looking for less destructive ways to harvest precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-eyes-toward-the-stars"&gt;Turning eyes toward the stars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space agencies and private companies are already exploring methods to mine resources on asteroids, whose metal content is often richer than that of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earths-first-crust-already-had-chemical-traits-of-modern-continents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Earth’s crust&lt;/a&gt;. The fungus’s ability to process gold in harsh conditions shows potential for extraterrestrial applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers envision deploying specialized microbial colonies to break down metals in orbiting rocks, transforming space mining into a more efficient, lighter operation without the need for massive excavators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers debate how well a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; would perform in low-gravity environments with limited nutrients. Yet the concept of sending living systems into space to work on raw materials intrigues those who want to lower mission costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fungus can multiply and process metals using minimal equipment, it might shift how organizations plan resource extraction far from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fresh-angle-on-sustainability"&gt;Fresh angle on sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are tightening environmental rules on mining because of landscape damage and water pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods to extract gold frequently involve toxic substances or large energy inputs. The new fungus-based approach presents an idea that goes hand-in-hand with more eco-conscious strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also potentially safer for workers, who could see a reduced need for heavy machinery. More importantly, harnessing a living organism’s capabilities means that gold may be collected in forms that are easier to refine with fewer harsh processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these notions remain in the early stages, they shine a light on how biology can inform industrial practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-future-plans"&gt;Challenges and future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists must still figure out how to cultivate this organism on a grand scale. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/family-photographs-a-rare-red-cane-fungus-thought-to-be-extinct-stinkhorn-mushroom/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; may need very particular conditions to produce gold particles efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moisture, soil pH, and other minerals might influence how well it grows and how much gold it accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring no harmful mutations take place during large-scale fungal cultivation is also a concern. The introduction of any non-native organism to new environments warrants caution, especially if plans involve use in space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration among biologists, engineers, and mining experts could clarify best practices so that the fungus remains beneficial without unexpected ecological impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prospects-for-the-mining-industry"&gt;Prospects for the mining industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mining firms are already discussing the potential for gold-focused fungal detection kits. These kits could analyze samples in less time than typical drilling and surveying routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the fungus picks up subtle traces of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-gold-rush-begins-as-very-high-volume-deposit-identified-in-a-single-drill-hole/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, exploration teams would zero in on precise areas with a higher likelihood of viable deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same methods could apply to other metals that share certain chemical traits with gold.

My hands did that too,' commented one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts speaking to MailOnline explain that fat loss to the hands can &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/us-health-weekend-features-project/article-11710299/Wegovy-prompts-muscle-loss-patients-doctors-say.html"&gt;happen with any version of the drug, including Wegovy and Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pharmacist and nutritional therapist Deborah Grayson, known as The Godmother of Pharmacology on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tgopharm"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said: '&lt;span&gt;Ozempic hands is the visible thinning of fingers that can occur during rapid weight loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'As with weight loss in general, fat loss doesn't happen evenly across the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The hands, which naturally have very little fat to begin with, can appear bonier or slimmer as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It's not a side effect of the medication itself, but rather a visual consequence of rapid fat loss.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added that it wasn't harmful, however the change would be permanent - unless the patient regained weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cosmetic treatments such as injections of fillers to 'plump' and rejuvenate the hands may be one remedy, however these are specialist procedures and cost many hundreds of pounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics told MailOnline that 'Ozempic hands' or alternatively 'Ozempic fingers' are a real phenomenon that can occur among people taking weight-loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro. Oprah Winfrey, who has confirmed she has taken weight-loss jabs, is pictured with noticeably thinner fingers in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured here are Oprah's hands in 2015, looking noticeably fuller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GP Dr Donald Grant, a senior clinical advisor at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theindependentpharmacy.co.uk/"&gt;The Independent Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, also said Ozempic hands or fingers was nothing to medically be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added that patients on the drugs should still keep an eye on potential side effects and seek advice from their GP if needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'S&lt;span&gt;hould people experience increased side effect intensity or different reactions to the treatment, people should visit their GP, who can provide further advice,' he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Anyone concerned about the amount of weight they're losing should also seek urgent medical attention.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the TikTok clip that sparked the new discussion of the side effect, &lt;span&gt;a woman posting under the name 'atruthforyou' compared images of Khloe Kardashian's hands from 2012 to a picture taken in 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the latter, the star's fingers are noticeably thinner and appear longer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are her hands today, like how, what is going on here?' she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a follow up video on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKKbwcmN88D/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; she continued: 'You're telling me this hand transformation is just from weight loss?

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic hands' is just the latest in a series of side effects people have speculated A-listers may be suffering from after taking weight-loss jabs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In extreme and rapid cases of weight loss - such as that which occurs in people using weight-loss jabs - surgery can be the only remedy for this excess skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it's not just a cosmetic issue; patients with excess skin can also suffer mobility problems and infections due to excess skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if they choose to fix the issue with surgery, they also face the inescapable risk of surgical complications including blood clots. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue of the aesthetic aftermath of weight-loss jabs is only going to grow larger as the drugs are dished out to more and more people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 4,000 patients a month are prescribed GLP-1 drugs on the NHS in the UK, with almost 350,000 patients receiving the medications in 2024, though additionally 500,000 are thought to be taking the drugs privately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And more could be on the way - as British GPs will be able to prescribe the jabs directly to patients from this month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a shake-up from the previous system which required patients to attend a specialist NHS weight-loss clinic to get the jabs on the health service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this will initially only be available for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14767431/weight-loss-jabs-NHS-ETHAN-ENNALS-drugs-FREE-GP.html"&gt;severely obese patients with multiple health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is expected more patients will be able to get the jabs from their family doctor as restrictions are relaxed over the next three years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, it is estimated about 13 per cent of the population - roughly 33million people - have tried the drugs at least once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the injections have been linked to multiple health benefits that go beyond combating obesity, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13412979/Millions-Brits-Ozempic-slash-chances-heart-attack-stroke-biggest-breakthrough-statins.html"&gt;a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, other studies suggest that could also carry some risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14773791/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-kidney-cancer-risk-study.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested they could raise the risk of a type of cancer that is surging in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:17:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMW85NURTb3B2bXdTZ0RFenpDZkp4UE9tSjZ1R2NxSWFoYzkyRFpxUEVabXJXNzNRMVVpZWtLQ1RKYnRaZVk1Q3JNOUZpRXdZUF84OThUcGtZUDhUWWFhNDFuUng5d3ZDeVVDTm5hVDdyOXVkaG9LYzV1NjFENEE0VDFqWUxNLTU4b0J5VkRBRU5EdGpUcjhiTlFzQldVNlYtbEd0cGpsYW1FekZ0SnM3YlA5X2tPRnM</guid></item><item><title>当我们的大脑空白时会发生什么-雅虎 | What happens when our brain goes blank - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My thoughts often feel like endless streams of information. That’s until someone asks me the name of a stranger I met six or seven seconds before, and my mind goes blank. Mind blanking is much more common than you might think. Researchers think that &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00034-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:our minds are blank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;our minds are blank&lt;/a&gt; somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of the time. Neuroscientists face significant hurdles in adding color and detail to the mystery of an empty mind, but new research is trying to establish the edges of these formless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Defining the blank mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/en/directory?uid=u205869" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Athena Demertzi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Athena Demertzi&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Liège, recently published a review paper on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00034-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind-blanking research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind-blanking research&lt;/a&gt;. The field has struggled to agree on what the term means–Demertzi’s paper lists no fewer than seven different definitions. Her preferred view is that mind blanking is about “the impression of having no thoughts or not being able to report any thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This interpretation is intentionally vague, as people can use all kinds of language to self-report a mind blank. Examples include “I don’t remember what I was thinking” or “I wasn’t paying attention.” Demertzi says that this can trip up researchers who attempt to incorporate other &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/see-most-detailed-map-human-180000521.html" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; processes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/unique-memory/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, into their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within this broad definition, Demertzi then works to separate different strands of mind blanking. This work is fraught with complications. One of the most reliable tools for examining the brain’s inner workings is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Demertzi explains that fMRI researchers often ask their volunteers to “think of nothing” while in the scanner. Doing so causes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31389642/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:activation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;activation&lt;/a&gt; along the midline of the brain in regions like the cingulate cortex, says Demertzi. However, rather than being a marker of a blank mind, this signal is a cognitive marker of the effort required to suppress thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;A signal behind mind blanking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To block out this signal, Demertzi tried a different strategy. In a 2023 study, her team &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/40/6807.abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:monitored the brains of people at rest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;monitored the brains of people at rest&lt;/a&gt; in a scanner. At random intervals, participants were asked to report what they had been thinking of. The team then analyzed the brain activity patterns in the seconds preceding their response. The brains of individuals who reported blank minds showed a distinct signal, a pattern involving a momentary synchronization of brain networks. “They are all deactivated,” says Demertzi. This signal is also seen during sleep or anesthesia, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This finding is supported by other research that has established &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81618-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation&lt;/a&gt; our brains are experiencing, called arousal. When arousal levels are low, mind-blanking episodes are more likely to occur. This is suggested to be because high arousal is necessary to keep up a continuous stream of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There may be a cost to keeping up a very high state of arousal, however. At high levels, this focus tips over into anxiety, which inhibits performance. Demertzi’s paper points out that these anxious states can lead to racing thoughts that may blur individual ideas and make them hard to recall–another form of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Mind blanking and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In certain cases, mind blanking can even be a feature of clinical conditions. “We know that it manifests in clinical states like ADHD,” says Demertzi. Unmedicated kids with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/adhd-may-evolved-us-foraging-130000557.html" data-ylk="slk:ADHD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; report &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617708234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind blanking at a higher rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind blanking at a higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than kids without the condition. Other conditions that feature racing thoughts, like generalized anxiety disorder, also include mind blanking as a related feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The ultimate question for Demertzi is why mind blanking happens in the first place. Researchers are still trying to figure this out, although she suggests that the link to sleep and arousal may be a hint. “When we sleep,” says Demertzi, “Our neurons are getting rest by throwing away what has been accumulated throughout the day through the glymphatic system.” &lt;br&gt;Demertzi says that this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7698404/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:toxin-clearing function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;toxin-clearing function&lt;/a&gt;–which is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01638-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disputed by some sleep neuroscientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disputed by some sleep neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;–may also occur in brief periods while we are awake. We notice these “pit stops” in cognition as mind blanks. Ultimately, these blanks may be a way our brain maintains high function for the rest of our waking experience. “How can you sustain a continuous wakeful life if our brains are not helping a bit?” says Demertzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI</guid></item><item><title>人民药店：这种非处方过敏药物是否导致我膝盖疼痛？ - OregonLive.com | People’s Pharmacy: Did this OTC allergy medicine cause my excruciating knee pain? - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BWVOY24CQBDELDXQ6NXPISPPEE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR PEOPLE’S PHARMACY:&lt;/b&gt; After trying several nasal sprays and prescription medications for severe seasonal allergies, I was thrilled to find that levocetirizine worked wonders. In January, I started taking one tablet per day.

While FMT aims to restore gut health by transplanting stool microbes from healthy donors, most microbes come from the colon and may colonize unintended regions like the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This misplacement leads to “terraforming,” where microbes change tissue environments to suit their survival. The study urges caution and proposes a new approach—omni-microbial transplants—that better aligns microbes with their native gut environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Mismatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Colon microbes from FMT can colonize unintended gut regions like the small intestine, altering function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; A single FMT caused persistent changes in metabolism, immune activity, and behavior in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers suggest omni-microbial transplants to match microbes with appropriate intestinal regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have been touted as a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, from inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes to autism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of Chicago, however, cautions against widespread use of FMT because of the potential for long-lasting, unintended health consequences for recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMT involves transferring microbes in the stool from a healthy person to a sick one, in hopes of restoring a healthy equilibrium in the gut microbiome. Since stools contain primarily anaerobic microbes from the colon (i.e. they can’t tolerate oxygen), FMT can cause mismatches in the gut ecosystem when those bacteria colonize the small intestine and other parts of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments with mice and studies with human tissue samples, the researchers conducting the new study saw that anaerobic microbes from the colon not only colonized the small bowel after a single transplant but also persisted there for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes also changed their new intestinal environments to their advantage, “terraforming” them in ways that caused changes in the recipient’s metabolism, behavior, and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there,” said Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A vast and varied ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMT is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for treating repeated infections with &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile (C. diff)&lt;/em&gt;, an opportunistic bacterium that often causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation in hospital patients who have been on antibiotics. Seeing the success in treating &lt;em&gt;C. diff &lt;/em&gt;patients, many physicians have been eager to use FMT to treat other digestive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers understand that gut microbiome health can impact all vital organs and systems of the body, so the idea is that replacing a “sick” gut microbiome with a “healthy” one could fix the problem in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut isn’t simply one consistent environment with the same microbiota throughout, however; instead, it has several distinct regions that are vastly different microbial ecosystems, each tailored for specific microbes that can provide functions vital to the health of their host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are microbes along the entire intestinal tract, and we just study predominately the last third of it (the colon),” DeLeon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, how can you expect an FMT, with microbes from a third of the intestinal tract at the end of it, to fix the rest of the intestine?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effects of FMT on different parts of the intestine, DeLeon, Eugene B. Chang, MD, the Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine at UChicago and senior author of the study, and their team carried out a series of experiments with mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group of mice was given a transplant of microbes taken from the jejunum, the first portion of the small intestine. A second group was given a standard FMT, and a third group was given a transplant from the cecum, a section connecting the small and large intestine, which has a mixture of microbes from both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recipients of FMT are usually treated with antibiotics first to clear out the microbes living in the gut, leaving a clean slate for newly transplanted microbes to take up residence – sometimes, however, in the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing showed that microbes from each of these transplants successfully colonized the entirety of the intestinal tract in the mice, not just their native niches. This created regional gut mismatches persisting up to three months after just one transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The altered microbiomes also changed the production of metabolites in each intestinal region, which can have health effects on the host. The researchers saw changes in liver metabolism, including activity in genes associated with immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also observed differences in eating behaviors, activity, and energy expenditure in the mice after transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking finding was that having the wrong microbes in the wrong place reshaped the tissue identity to make it more suitable for them. DeLeon saw that mismatches changed gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining in ways that more closely resembled expression levels from the microbes’ original or native intestinal regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like they’re engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An ‘omni-microbial’ approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang said that this research highlights the need for more caution with FMT before we fully understand the long-term effects of introducing one set of microbes into a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have absolutely no idea what’s in FMT, except that it’s a combination of microbes,” Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But even a single FMT will cause a change in the host-microbe relationships in these very different regions of the bowel that may be very difficult to reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both DeLeon and Chang advocate for “omni-microbial transplants,” or OMT, instead. This approach would transfer microbes taken from all the different regions of the intestine, not just those largely from the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether given via an endoscopy or in pill form, microbes naturally settle in the right places, especially when they are competing side by side with others that normally inhabit a certain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s an open space, something’s going to fill it,” DeLeon said. “But the microbes that were supposed to be there are better suited for it, so they’re more naturally going to fill it even in the presence of other microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeLeon plans to keep studying how different microbes exert their influence in different parts of the intestine, using different approaches like single cell sequencing and metabolomics to track their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also exploring how the gut regions terraformed by microbiota mismatches can be restored to their original state, which could help restore normal gut function. Such deeper understanding could lead to improvements in the application of microbial transplants, ultimately helping them live up to their significant promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study, “Regional microbiota mismatches from fecal microbiota transplants promote persistent, off-target consequences to the host,” was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the UChicago GI Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Mora Mocanu, Candace M.

We hypothesized that peroral FMTs create host-microbe mismatches that impact SB homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, antibiotic-treated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice were given jejunal, cecal, or fecal microbiota transplants (JMTs, CMTs, or FMTs, respectively) and studied 1 or 3 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JMT and FMT altered regional microbiota membership and function, energy balance, and intestinal and hepatic transcriptomes; JMT favored host metabolic pathways and FMT favored immune pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTs drove regional intestinal identity (&lt;em&gt;Gata4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gata6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Satb2&lt;/em&gt;) and downstream differentiation markers. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of metabolite-exposed human enteroids and duodenal biopsies post-FMT confirmed transcriptional changes in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, regional microbial mismatches after FMTs can lead to unintended consequences and require rethinking of microbiome-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:56:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9SaU5vY0tYWm5UT2RzVVhRNy04WXhDWXB5SEpRVkpvZzFCVlJ3NVB1M2k2Ny1TaGY3djV5OGdpTEJSMVhqbFFLeWtWZ05CcGVjV1JWZ2wxWFVkemp4THoxLU00cHdoMjBSTTl0WUlkZw</guid></item><item><title>哈佛医生列出了6种已知会导致癌症的最糟糕的食物：它们的替代品是什么-印度时报 | Harvard doctor lists 6 worst foods that are known to cause cancer: What are their alternatives - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwJBVV95cUxNS2YwcURvdDlxaWNtUGxHelQ3ekJ5WVR2WTkweEZEa3ViTU03NFZKU2VxdUxvUGxsUm5tVmdiOGRmOGgyV3VYYloxZkF3WGxPaEE1SUViTDBYNUc4OHJGNkRyYlVZNGJtTmRJSkROM2F6REZrOWlvenppUFZvUmdWcHZ5cFdmb1pOcHdRd21SdURwVGlhSVF3WkJMSnR1eUo5c2FpdmRNS2Fka3BOcXYzdG5vY3k3N05iY3luSGxiTFE1QXhua1pVMy11ckM0aS0xM0dabnFxcVMtR0N6TExSYzU4Wk1lSS1wejVVN01VcmpCOVAxWVNlczVBTU9rQ2pyazZqRXdQS2lhLXB4Tm9DalRsUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaged snacks, instant noodles, and ready-to-eat meals are seen as saviors in busy routines.

If a cold sore pops up, should you be concerned about dementia? We reached out to experts who explained everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“HSV-1 is a common virus to which almost everyone is exposed early in life,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston. “It is best known for causing cold sores and is closely related to chicken pox and mononucleosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What these viruses have in common is that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/neurotropism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurotropic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;neurotropic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they linger in the nervous system long after the initial illness, explains &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System, and can be reactivated by stress or lowered immunity. That’s how, for instance, chicken pox can manifest later in life as shingles, adds Dr. Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus’s ability to infiltrate the nerves is believed to get it past the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that shields the organ from infection via the bloodstream. Thanks to that entry point, Dr. Hunter says, HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral brain inflammation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is no vaccine for HSV and almost everyone will get it by adulthood,” Dr. Hunter adds. Cold sores are a mild case of it, and symptoms can be treated with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s may be connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dormant HSV-1 may be reactivated by illness and reach the brain, explains &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada. This can trigger brain inflammation over time, known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes encephalitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;herpes encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;and in people with genetic risk factors, like the ApoE-4 gene, contribute to Alzheimer’s development, he adds. “We don’t entirely know why ApoE-4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s,” adds Dr. Hunter. “The link to HSV could be that ApoE-4 impacts the blood-brain barrier and makes it easier for HSV to enter.” And the inflammation caused by that entry may heighten Alzheimer’s risk. “It is now universally accepted that inflammation in the brain is a key step in the development of Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Hunter reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What experts think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the three decades since the original study, doctors and researchers have learned much more about Alzheimer’s disease and its connection to viral inflammation. For instance, several &lt;a href="https://www.uth.edu/news/story/several-vaccines-associated-with-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adults-65-and-older" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that being immunized for any disease (like COVID-19 or the flu) reduces Alzheimer’s risk, says Dr. Hunter. “Several other studies have shown that reducing inflammation in the brain helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Santos concurs. “Since 1996, additional studies have found HSV-1 DNA in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. Lab studies have also shown that HSV-1 infection can trigger the buildup of amyloid-beta and tau—proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, there are a few disclaimers to note. Firstly, the posed risk is associated with people who contract HSV-1 in early life, giving it time to progressively cause inflammation. The risk may be lower in adults, says Santos. “That said, if someone has other risk factors (like a weakened immune system or APOE-e4), adult-onset HSV-1 could still have long-term consequences,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, neurotropic viruses are extremely common, Dr. Yancey reiterates. “This makes it difficult to tease out whether they are causing neurologic problems or are simply common in the general population, including people with neurologic problems,” she adds. In other words, because most people end up with HSV-1 doesn’t necessarily mean that most people will get Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Most cold sores aren’t a cause for concern,” Santos adds. “They’re common and usually well-controlled by the immune system. But for people with frequent outbreaks, weakened immunity, or APOE-e4, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider. The concern is not a single cold sore, but long-term viral activity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research, including long-term studies, is needed to make any solid associations, Santos and Dr. Yancey conclude. “The current data is based on population-level surveys. There is no way to predict on an individual patient’s level whether this has a meaningful impact,” says Dr. Yancey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Future research will, hopefully, at least help experts understand how antiviral treatment affects Alzheimer’s risk, as well as identify better ways to detect when HSV-1 is active in the brain. “The hope is that understanding how infections contribute to Alzheimer’s will open up new ways to prevent or treat it—especially before symptoms start,” says Santos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Lifestyle choices that may help lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being vaccinated, exercising, engaging in mental stimulation, and maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g33416014/heart-healthy-food-wd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; are all known ways to lower dementia risk, our experts say. Avoiding smoking or nicotine use of any kind can also “drastically” reduce the risk, says Dr. Yancey. All of these habits and choices work together to support both immune and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNRndLVDBRbkl0MWV1TkQ4U2FxeFRuZUt0ZldnTFJud00wdGlieUZ2ODhocGNVZGJIR2w5djB0RmJGNlRaTEJPbEZ4SUM4akdlMWpGeTlMdG9iQThTbEc5dEQ5VUcyRTd3djVsVWNuVEhOS0RpSk0zNjFBbG54OW1oYkdlZzNjZXJIWXowRU5RZw</guid></item><item><title>独家|医生驳斥了我令人不安的症状，但我推了—我怎么知道是癌症-《纽约邮报》 | Exclusive | Doctors dismissed my troubling symptom but I pushed — how I knew it was cancer - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPQ3dSeGk4ZDJjMUJRS0hJZUZjakxWWkVOTnFaVHh0ckdfWkpXSnNZUEdGNmVMRTRRSHRJdUdvQlR5aGNqaExFNng1dml5bmxOUUZyZW9fUFdWbTIzbG53SzY0Z3ZyVElrazktZ1RHNDJsZnZMbW85eGQxYTgzbm9FZ1oybmhmcGVSa2VjTUxENTl1ZnVQZ190eg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Mills is used to seeing spots — but this one was different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old public school teacher rushed to a dermatologist after a small mark suddenly appeared on her right cheek, the threat of skin cancer weighing on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of a diagnosis, Mills got dismissed. “They were worried about me getting a scar on my face and not wanting to test it,” she told The Post. “That’s when I sought a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma is on the rise among young women, including survivors like Jackie Mills. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing she did. Tests at Mount Sinai revealed the spot was stage zero melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that’s been rising rapidly in young adults, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for spreading quickly throughout the body, melanoma can become life-threatening in as little as six weeks if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mole patrol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a family history of melanoma, Mills was no stranger to skin checks and gets a full-body scan from her dermatologist once a year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While she’s “covered with spots,” the mark on her cheek stood out when it began to change and grow rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I noticed was that there was some discoloration, one side of it was lighter than the other side, ” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What really set me off was that the borders were very jagged and irregular. The shape was also strange, it wasn’t a perfect circle,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A brown, irregularly shaped spot with jagged edges appeared on Mills’ cheek.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those are classic red flags for skin cancer, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jesse-miller-lewin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Jesse Miller Lewin&lt;/a&gt;, vice chair of surgical operations and system chief of the Division of Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Post that one easy way to remember the warning signs is to follow the ABCDEs of melanoma:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; is for asymmetry: Cancerous moles tend to be misshapen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; is for border: Melanomas often have jagged, uneven edges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; is for color: Look out for lesions that are more than one color or shade.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; is for diameter: Spots larger than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) are a concern.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; is for evolution: Changes in a mole’s size, shape or color can signal danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A history of change or “evolution” of an existing pigmented lesion is the most predictive sign of melanoma among all the ABCDE criteria,” Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No moles? That doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. Most melanomas appear as brand-new spots on previously clear, healthy skin. The cancer can develop anywhere, including the eyes, scalp, nails, feet and even inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Face to face with cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma may be one of the deadliest skin cancers. However, if caught early, it’s highly treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma signs include changes in the size, shape or color of a mole or new skin growth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pixel-Shot – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed at stage zero, the five-year survival rate is over 99%. But once it spreads to distant organs and body parts, like the lungs or bones, that number nosedives to just 35%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates-for-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-stage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a blessing and a curse that this was on my face,” Mills said. “It made it harder to remove, and I do have a scar, but I think it’s why I noticed the changes so quickly and they caught it at stage zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think if this spot was in a different part of my body, I wouldn’t have noticed how quickly it was changing and it could have been a very different outcome for me,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of her diagnosis, Mills underwent Mohs surgery at Mount Sinai. The highly technical procedure involves removing skin in layers, examining each under a microscope until all the cancer cells are gone while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Jesse Lewin removed Mills’ melanoma with minimal scarring. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Melanoma has cells that can be visible on slides under the microscope extending beyond what you can be see with the naked eye,” Lewin said. “If cells are left behind the melanoma can get deeper or spread to lymph nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the original spot was tiny — no bigger than the top of a push pin — by the time Lewin was done removing the cancer, Mills had a wound about the size of a quarter on her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took about a year for the wound to fully heal and the scar to fade. To minimize it, she turned to laser treatments and silicone scar cream.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Now most people can’t even really tell that I have a scar,” Mills said. “The only people that know are the people that knew me at the time, it’s healed really, really nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scan it, spot it, stop it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now 34 and cancer-free, Mills sees the dermatologist twice a year and uses advanced technologies like the Vectra scan to monitor any changes in her skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get a full body yearly scan, you’re relying on your dermatologist to record and remember your moles and your spots from the year before,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vectra WB360 scan, by contrast, is a 3D whole-body imaging system with more than 40 cameras that can document all of your freckles, moles and other growths in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Vectra body scanner at Mount Sinai is the only device of its kind in New York City.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“If you’re someone with a skin type that has a lot of spots, this is a really good option because it’s an added layer of protection,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now you can have the doctor’s eyes and a computerized scan of your entire body, which can measure the size and the pigment and the type of spots that you have and compare them from year to year,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re average risk for skin cancer, get a full head-to-toe check by a dermatologist once a year, according to Lewin. But if you’ve got a history, he recommends going twice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to wait for your annual appointment to stay on top of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are an important tool, but you are your first line of defense when it comes to dermatology,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors recommend that people regularly conduct self-exams for melanoma. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run into a dismissive provider like Mills did, don’t back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hesitation when it comes to melanoma could be the difference between a simple removal and getting chemotherapy, because that’s how quickly it moves and how deadly it is,” Mills said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewin echoed her warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Trust your gut — if a lesion on your skin is new or changing and you are concerned, see a dermatologist,” he said. “If you remain concerned after seeing one doctor, get a second opinion. Because [Mills] did that, it saved her life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If you’ve had melanoma before, you are more likely to develop it again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dark side of sun kissed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma makes up just 1% of all skin cancers, but it causes the vast majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;group estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 104,960 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the US, and roughly 8,430 Americans will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While melanoma risk increases with age, &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/112435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that rates among children, adolescents and young adults have increased by more than 250% over the past four decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soaking up UV rays — whether from the sun or tanning beds — is a major risk factor for melanoma. Having a lot of moles or lighter skin, hair or eyes increases your chances, too.&lt;/p&gt;

But it can also happen right in the kitchen, through simple daily habits that you likely have a lot of control over.

But some early research results allow us to see that the potential health consequences may not be great. For example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research findings" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683f1d49e4b00646f8249f94" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from one observational study show that microplastics found in arteries may potentially increase the risk of having a stroke and heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re concerned about your microplastic exposure — and how your kitchen habits may be playing a role — we have some good news.

    &lt;p&gt;“Most people in the UK have blood pressure that’s higher than the ideal, but as a general guide, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/midlife-blood-pressure-explained-normal-worry-do/"&gt;normal blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg,” says Prof MacGregor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the proven ways of reducing blood pressure? The best methods to reduce blood pressure, according to the experts, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#medication"&gt;Medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#cut-back-on-salt"&gt;Cut back on salt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#foods-that-reduce-blood-pressure"&gt;Eat potassium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#exercise-more"&gt;Exercise more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#lose-weight-"&gt;Lose weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#cut-back-on-alcohol"&gt;Cut back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#quit-smoking-and-vaping"&gt;Quit smoking – and vaping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#prioritise-sleep"&gt;Prioritise sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#know-your-supplements-"&gt;Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#monitor-your-blood-pressure-at-home"&gt;Monitor your blood pressure at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have very effective ways of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/numbers-controlling-midlife-health-how-change/"&gt;reducing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; with four main types of medicine. “They reduce blood pressure through different mechanisms and that’s important because your body will try to stop it working,” says MacGregor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One tablet might reduce the pressure through one mechanism, and then if your body manages to block it, you might be prescribed another pill that works through a different mechanism. If you’re given two tablets that work in different ways, that’s more effective than one, and if you’re on three, that can be more effective than two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four main types are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)&lt;/strong&gt; – both work by controlling the hormones that help relax and widen the blood vessels, which &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/6-life-changing-benefits-of-taking-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;in turn lowers&lt;/a&gt; the pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thiazide diuretics&lt;/strong&gt; – which removes excess fluid from the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) – &lt;/strong&gt;prevent calcium from entering the cells of the heart and arteries (since calcium causes them to contract more strongly), allowing blood vessels to relax and open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects for some include dizziness &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/different-types-headaches-how-to-treat-migraines/"&gt;and headaches&lt;/a&gt;. “Some people won’t have any side effects. It depends on the drug and the person, and also whether they are on any other medicines,” says Ruth Goss, a senior cardiac nurse with the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term health consequences of uncontrolled high blood pressure are much worse. If you have any concerns about your medication, don’t alter the dose or stop taking it. Talk to your GP,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely key – the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Even if you are on blood pressure medication, a salty diet can make it work less effectively. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/how-to-add-flavour-without-raising-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;Reducing your salt intake&lt;/a&gt; will have an impact quickly too – often within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we need a small amount of salt to stay healthy – about 4 grams each day – we should eat no more than 6g, or one level teaspoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us eat too much. Roughly 75 per cent is from processed foods, 15 per cent is added during cooking or before eating (so remove the salt cellar from the table), and 10 per cent is found naturally in food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to processed foods, check labels carefully for salt or sodium – two loaves of bread or boxes of cereal made by the same company can contain wildly different quantities. “When buying tinned fish, pulses or vegetables, opt for the ones in water over brine,” says Kate Llewellyn-Waters, author, nutritionist and resident expert on TV programme You Are What You Eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know your &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/everyday-foods-sneaking-salt-diet-11-easy-ways-cut/"&gt;high-salt items&lt;/a&gt;, these are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ketchup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gravy granules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pocessed meats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ready meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Takeaways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for unsalted butter is one example of a simple swap you can make. The FoodSwitch app allows you to scan the barcodes of food and drink and instantly see whether they are high, medium or low in salt. It also suggests healthier alternative products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When cooking, one of the most effective tips to retrain your taste buds is to add &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/herbs-spices-reduce-blood-pressure-heart-disease-use-meals-diet-2022/"&gt;herbs or spices&lt;/a&gt; in place of salt,” says Llewellyn-Waters. Lemon juice, cumin, shallots and fresh or dried herbs will all add flavour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that salt preference is an acquired taste that can be unlearned. It takes six to eight weeks to adjust to much lower quantities – after that, you’ll never enjoy a pretzel again.&lt;/p&gt;

This rose from just 2.5 per cent one month before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO declared the NB.1.8.1 strain a “variant under monitoring” on 23 May, which means scientists believe it could potentially affect the behaviour of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why has there been a surge in new cases? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Herrero, a virologist from Griffith University in Australia, suspects that NB.1.8.1 spreads more easily than other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested, suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains,” Dr Herrero wrote last month in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 eGBSeb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The Covid vaccines protect people from the worst effects of the illness" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-96465"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The Covid vaccines protect people from the worst effects of the illness&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chun Tang, GP at Pall Mall Medical, added: “NB.1.8.1 isn’t too different from the Omicron variant, but it does have some tweaks to its spike protein, which might make it spread a bit more easily or slip past some of our existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, early signs suggest it doesn’t seem to cause more serious illness, but of course, we’re still learning more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its spread has been identified in around 22 countries,” said Dr Naveed Asif, GP at The London General Practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The WHO assesses the additional risk to the global public as currently low, and existing Covid-19 &lt;a href="/topic/vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are considered effective in preventing severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nimbus does appear to be more transmissible than previous variants, with notable increases reported in India, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand, notes Dr Asif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of the NB.1.8.1 variant include a severe sore throat. fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been reported that some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare experts have stressed, however, that there is no evidence that the new strain is more deadly or serious than previous variants, and that current Covid vaccines are expected to remain effective and protect anyone infected from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNeWc5MFU4TUtlSUw4WXMyN3dQVzNxeXpsY1lJWWJ2SlB4czl3UkF5UFo0WDdZSzJqbnczXzhNWmNicExlVHFMX0tmV1RRTEJhdkQwNXEwdjBqcWVtbEhpZ29XVE1IdTJoMHRSTWJreF9YVmUteFFXME9lVktldGJDaDQtMGJLYmUwNW4xZ2FMaFczanJuSUJqSDVIWkI1UHJVYmM0</guid></item><item><title>暂停细胞死亡（称为坏死）可能是抵抗衰老过程的秘诀- Earth.com | Pausing cell death, known as necrosis, may be the secret to defying the aging process - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcWkydlNIWllwN0FhWmxvTms0a09uYS1Xa2dDWGRDVnh4eEh2dGJHNERqZ1U0TzI4ZHZ1ZmxzamQ2aVo3RXJRekF0MVJiOGQ0ZExhYlVmOFpMZWN2NWF5bkRVenlHWEpqZmdFdjAtNWdKZi1uX1NHMjQ1WGZReDVMbGJ4ZGVzcXlRWVh3aE1OYVRHODZmbEg3aEpRa3M2QWZJdHBtcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging has long been viewed as a slow and inevitable decline. But new research suggests that hidden deep within the body’s cellular processes, there may be a crucial trigger point – one that could be changed, paused, or even reversed. The process in question is necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers from University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.linkgevity.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LinkGevity&lt;/a&gt;, and the European Space Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ESA&lt;/a&gt;) places necrosis at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; and disease. The paper suggests that necrosis might not just be a consequence of damage. It might be a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-necrosis-may-be-the-trigger-of-aging"&gt;Necrosis may be the trigger of aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is a chaotic form of cell death caused by stress, infection, or injury. Unlike controlled cell death, it damages nearby tissues and triggers inflammation. The study suggests necrosis is not just a final event but an active driver of aging and chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood. And in a way necrosis is death,” noted Dr. Keith Siew from the UCL Centre for Kidney &amp;amp; Bladder Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If enough cells die, then tissues die, then we die. The question is what would happen if we could pause or stop necrosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chaotic-cell-death-spreads-damage"&gt;Chaotic cell death spreads damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells are the building blocks of all living organisms. Their death is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; and necessary, but only when it happens in a regulated way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy systems, cells are replaced in a clean and controlled fashion. This process, known as apoptosis, helps organs regenerate and stay functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is different. It happens without order or purpose. When it occurs, cells rupture and spill their contents into surrounding tissue. This creates inflammation, spreads damage, and accelerates aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis remains one of the last frontiers in medicine – a common thread across &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-rule-of-biology-sai-proposed-to-explain-aging-and-how-to-control-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, disease, space biology, and scientific progress itself,” said Dr. Carina Kern, lead author of the study and CEO of LinkGevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calcium-imbalance-causes-cell-collapse"&gt;Calcium imbalance causes cell collapse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of necrosis is calcium, a mineral that helps regulate cell function. Normally, cells maintain much higher calcium levels outside their membranes than inside. This gradient helps control vital activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111129/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111137/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1s.webp" alt="Illustration of a healthy cell (left) alongside a cell that has been affected by necrosis (right).

Click image to enlarge. Credit: LinkGevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When calcium floods in, the cell collapses, spills toxins, and triggers harmful inflammation. “When cells die, it’s not always a peaceful process for the neighbors,” Dr. Siew noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxic-cell-death-links-diseases"&gt;Toxic cell death links diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis triggers a domino &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. As toxic materials spread, nearby cells are affected. This leads to more cell death, more inflammation, and a growing spiral of decline. Over time, the body becomes less able to repair itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws connections between necrosis and several chronic conditions. These include Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and kidney failure. These diseases are often seen as unrelated, but researchers argue they share a common thread: necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis has been hiding in plain sight. As a final stage of cell death, it’s been largely overlooked. But mounting evidence shows it’s far more than an endpoint. It’s a central mechanism through which systemic degeneration not only arises but also spreads,” noted Dr. Kern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it a critical point of convergence across many diseases. If we can target necrosis, we could unlock entirely new ways to treat conditions ranging from kidney failure to cardiac disease, neuro-degeneration, and even aging itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cell-death-harms-kidneys-as-we-age"&gt;Cell death harms kidneys as we age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all the organs affected by necrosis, the kidneys may suffer the most. They filter blood, regulate fluid levels, and support other systems. As people age, these functions often falter. Nearly half of those over 75 show signs of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights how necrosis lies at the center of this decline. Stressors such as low oxygen, oxidative stress, and toxin buildup all lead to necrosis in kidney tissues. Once it begins, it fuels a feedback loop that becomes hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With kidney disease, there’s no one underlying reason that the kidneys fail. It could be a lack of oxygen, inflammation, oxidative stress, a build-up of toxins, and so on,” Dr. Siew explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these stressors eventually lead to necrosis, which initiates a positive feedback loop that spirals out of control, leading to kidney failure. We can’t stop all of these stressors, but if you could intervene at the point of necrosis, you’d effectively achieve the same result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-in-space"&gt;Aging in space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of necrosis extend far beyond Earth. In space, astronauts face conditions that mimic and accelerate aging. Low gravity and cosmic radiation stress the body. Muscles waste away, bones weaken, and organs begin to fail more quickly than on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dr. Siew worked on a study that identified the human kidney as a major vulnerability during spaceflight. Necrosis appeared to play a central role. The body’s inability to manage stress in space could threaten the success of long-term missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Bailey is a professor of physiology and biochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://www.southwales.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and Chair of the ESA Life Sciences Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration,” noted Professor Bailey. “In space, the same factors that cause aging on Earth are made worse by cosmic radiation and microgravity – speeding up degeneration dramatically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-cell-death-to-support-healing"&gt;Stopping cell death to support healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis in vital organs triggers damage cycles that slow healing and reduce recovery capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many age-related diseases – affecting diverse organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and cardiovascular system – relentless cascades of necrosis fuel the progression of disease,” explained Dr. Kern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is often alongside impaired healing that leads to fibrosis, inflammation and damaged cells. Each cascade triggers and amplifies the next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source, enabling normal physiological processes and cell division to resume – and potentially even allowing for regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03431-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncogene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:17:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcWkydlNIWllwN0FhWmxvTms0a09uYS1Xa2dDWGRDVnh4eEh2dGJHNERqZ1U0TzI4ZHZ1ZmxzamQ2aVo3RXJRekF0MVJiOGQ0ZExhYlVmOFpMZWN2NWF5bkRVenlHWEpqZmdFdjAtNWdKZi1uX1NHMjQ1WGZReDVMbGJ4ZGVzcXlRWVh3aE1OYVRHODZmbEg3aEpRa3M2QWZJdHBtcQ</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了“每天超过10,000步”的步行方法–这就是为什么我是一个粉丝-独立报 | I tried the walking method ‘better than 10,000 steps per day’ – this is why I’m a fan - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPVVhieFBnU040SDlCcjNRZVBjSDdkbmtscVhrRmNUV2VmMXBSV2poaW0tazZQWU55aEhBQ3lTOERvRzItMUZnWm1KOEtZQUd5WEN1YkF6ZVktWHBBYVhyMzZlaXFYRDZsYlptd25zYTJGREtoS1Q4Q24xMHdHdVVFLXZ0ZEl5VmFweXdZc3BzOXdfcDNmekZIUnRZRWxoR2VRdVBObVhxTGJBY0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1kv918u-0 cDsnpW"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 djDghv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-258272"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 eVrEhv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-258273"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPVVhieFBnU040SDlCcjNRZVBjSDdkbmtscVhrRmNUV2VmMXBSV2poaW0tazZQWU55aEhBQ3lTOERvRzItMUZnWm1KOEtZQUd5WEN1YkF6ZVktWHBBYVhyMzZlaXFYRDZsYlptd25zYTJGREtoS1Q4Q24xMHdHdVVFLXZ0ZEl5VmFweXdZc3BzOXdfcDNmekZIUnRZRWxoR2VRdVBObVhxTGJBY0k</guid></item><item><title>鸡胸肉有多健康？ -《纽约时报》 | How Healthy Is Chicken Breast? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQMGM1d0VzaVowU3V3NFV0amFWejMzcjB0enptVC1hdFFhVk1zTEdZTEc4ZmJLRTVYcFN5d0dEY2ZtXzY1eUktOHlfSi0zLVNmTDh1YlZkQ3RYV1ZRV25jUjc1V3ROeWlab2xuV0JJODJ6bTdIbXdyQ3E0blM1Vm9lOE1xcVljUlAycmwzYUZYZXk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;All cuts of chicken are great for you, but on a number of metrics, the humble breast takes top prize. Along with containing nutrients that are involved in repairing the body’s tissues, building immunity and boosting energy, chicken breast is lower in saturated fat than thighs, legs and wings, making it a smart choice for people concerned about their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are a few ways that chicken breast benefits your body, along with some recipes from &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/465934-chicken-breast-recipes" title=""&gt;New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-26284069"&gt;It’s one of the best food sources of protein.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a per-calorie basis, there aren’t many whole foods richer in protein than chicken breast. “You’d have to eat protein powder to get more protein,” said Dave Bridges, a biochemist and associate professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are no carbohydrates and little fat in chicken breast, especially if you remove the skin, said Heidi Silver, the director of the Diet, Body Composition and Metabolism Core at Vanderbilt University. One &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/331960/nutrients" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;3.5-ounce serving&lt;/a&gt; of boneless, skinless chicken breast contains about 160 calories and 32 grams of protein.

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California-San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then one more — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman started experiencing intense anxiety and heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia. Frightened, she went to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia now &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical-cannabis-laws"&gt;allow cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as the district, &lt;a href="https://covercannabis.com/blog/where-is-marijuana-legal/#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20Legalized%20Recreational,nearly%20half%20of%20the%20country."&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons: to relieve chronic pain, insomnia, or mental health issues, though evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1156?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225"&gt;analysis of national survey data&lt;/a&gt; published June 2 in the medical journal JAMA, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous month) had jumped among adults age 65 or older to 7% of respondents in 2023, from 4.8% in 2021. In 2005, he pointed out, fewer than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived risk&lt;/a&gt; of cannabis use has declined. One national survey found that a growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/"&gt;proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought&lt;/a&gt; it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls “wisdom” customers, 55 or older. Rise Dispensaries ran a yearlong cannabis education and empowerment program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers. Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease. “I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects. “I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, which &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html"&gt;legalized nonmedical cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use for adults nationally in 2018, show climbing rates of cannabis-related health care use among older people, both in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100"&gt;outpatient settings&lt;/a&gt; and in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, cannabis-related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; by those 65 or older rose, to 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019 from about 21 in 2005. In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2021, and more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;26 times among those 65 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/"&gt;increased cardiac risk&lt;/a&gt; among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a disturbing proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976"&gt;screen positive for cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Network Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with other substance use disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (with an average age of 73) seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Study-reveals-high-rates-of-cannabis-use-disorder-in-older-US-veterans.aspx"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the previous 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for mild, moderate, or severe &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance misuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/dementia/115116"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of that for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had a 23% &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption, and on amounts of use that seem lower-risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products compared with the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The device itself is small, but the hype around it is big.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitors are only about the size of a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;quarter, but the companies that sell them make huge claims about their health benefits: You can "&lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;revolutionize your health&lt;/a&gt;," one company says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Trump's nominee for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/nx-s1-5389962/trump-casey-means-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means&lt;/a&gt;, is a prominent proponent of continuous glucose monitoring. She &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/" target="_blank"&gt;co-founded a company&lt;/a&gt; that distributes the devices and sells an app to help people use them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The monitor is a painless patch that sticks to your skin. Every few minutes or so, it sends a signal to an app on your phone with an estimate of your blood sugar. (It measures the sugar concentration between your skin cells, which roughly correlates with your blood sugar level.) The app also helps you keep a log of everything you eat, so that you can track how different foods impact your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies have found that this technology has transformed care for people with diabetes. "It has revolutionized their and their families' lives," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1882/elizabeth-selvin" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Selvin&lt;/a&gt;, who researches diabetes at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;approved the first&lt;/a&gt; continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Currently, two companies are making them: &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;Dexcom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hellolingo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt;. Each patch lasts about two weeks and costs about $50, so tracking your blood sugar for an extended period of time costs about $100 each month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The critical question is: Do they actually help people &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; diabetes or prediabetes improve their health?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70727" class="bucketwrap image small"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The theory&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After you eat a meal that contains carbohydrates, a healthy person's blood sugar rises, peaks and then gently falls back to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These peaks and troughs are the normal physiological response to consuming carbohydrates, in people without diabetes," says nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sarah-berry" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Berry&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of nutrition at King's College London. Berry is also &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;chief scientist at Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, a company that distributes continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and an app to interpret the data. "We do not need to flatten these curves," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But problems can arise when these peaks become too frequent and too high, Berry says. That could put you at a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-57257-2" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-014-3361-2" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3177738/" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17259492/" target="_blank"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, studies show. It can also make you hungrier between meals, Berry says, so you'll eat more at the next meal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The idea behind glucose monitoring is that it could help you identify specific meals or meal sizes that produce extreme peaks. Then if you modify the meal, that shift could help you lose weight, reduce your risk of diabetes or simply help you feel better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The findings&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two major studies have tested this theory with randomized control trials. In the studies, people wore a glucose monitoring patch for a period of time while they tracked what they ate on an app. Researchers used the data to design a personalized diet aimed at lowering blood sugar. Then the scientists tested how well this CGM-based diet stacked up against a standard low-fat or Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At a population level, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11124316/" target="_blank"&gt;findings have been mixed&lt;/a&gt;. In one study at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the CGM-based diet didn't help people lose more weight than simply following the Mediterranean diet. However, it did help them lower their blood sugar more, &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/9/1980/138839/Personalized-Postprandial-Glucose-Response" target="_blank"&gt;scientists reported&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second study compared the CGM-based diet to a low-fat, high-whole-grain diet. On average, both diets led to the same amount of weight loss and small improvements in blood sugar, researchers at New York University &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9520362/" target="_blank"&gt;reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37236549/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/collin-j-popp" target="_blank"&gt;Collin Popp,&lt;/a&gt; who helped lead this study, said the overall findings don't tell the whole story. These conclusions show only the average response across the whole population, Popp says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you look at the individual level, it's very different," he says. For some people, the glucose-monitoring approach helped tremendously. Some people lost a large amount of weight. "We had individuals coming back and saying, 'You changed my life. I lost 30 pounds and I feel great.' Other people in the study put on weight."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So now scientists are trying to figure out who benefits from this technology.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;When glucose monitors might be useful&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. If you're highly sensitive to carbohydrates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.realfood-matters.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Karen Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has been helping people interpret and understand their glucose-monitoring data for five years. In her experience, these devices help some people discover a heightened sensitivity to carbohydrates, even to healthy versions, such as whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They eat brown rice, quinoa, beans, rice or oatmeal, and their blood glucose consistently goes really high," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The monitor helps them realize that they'll manage their blood sugar better on a low-carb diet. "Not zero carbohydrates, but lower carbohydrates," Kennedy says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They change their diets, and then their blood sugar comes down dramatically," Kennedy says. "If they can keep up that new diet, they feel better and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt;lose visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. If you need extra motivation to eat healthier foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people already know what they need to do to improve their metabolic health. But putting this advice into practice — that's hard, both Kennedy and NYU's Popp say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The quick feedback from a continuous glucose monitor may give them a nudge to actually implement nutritional advice. "It's a motivator," Popp says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, one of Kennedy's clients clearly needed to add more protein and fat to their breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They were like, 'Sorry, but this is my breakfast, and it has worked for me for 30 years.'"  &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Then the client wore a patch for a week and saw how that breakfast shot their blood sugar super-high. They immediately changed their breakfast, Kennedy says. Right away, the client could see how this new breakfast improved their blood sugar levels. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They didn't have to wait a few months and go to the doctor to see it working," she says. "That agency can be motivating."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. If you need more awareness about your diet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study at NYU, some people greatly benefited from the CGM-based diet. When Popp and his colleague dug into their data deeper, they found one key factor for this success: whether the person &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/01/574109412/we-gave-weight-loss-using-food-tracking-apps-a-try" target="_blank"&gt;consistently logged their meals&lt;/a&gt; into the device's app over the six-month experiment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For some people, simply documenting what they ate helped them improve their diet and their blood sugar levels, Popp says. "I tell people all the time, 'Monitoring what you do can play a huge role in your health.'&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And you don't need to log the food accurately," he adds. "It's the mere act of documenting it that's important for most people."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We know that awareness helps people lose weight," adds Johns Hopkins' Selvin. "And it doesn't have to be with an app. I have a colleague who uses a little pocket notepad. It adds accountability" — and it's cheaper than glucose monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Before you decide to buy the device, experts say, be aware:&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many people find the data confusing and unhelpful. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Many people come to me and say, 'I have been using the device for three or even 12 months, and I have all this data, but I don't know what it means. I don't know how to lower my blood sugar or improve it,'" Kennedy says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People really need to be educated about what the data means, Popp agrees. But that education will go only so far because at this point, some of the data is still mysterious to scientists and doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you're staying within a normal range, say about 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL, scientists still don't understand what the peaks and troughs mean. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's no real standard guidelines about what's a good peak or a bad peak in nondiabetics," Popp says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The data can be misleading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;First off, the devices aren't super precise or accurate, and our bodies don't always respond the same way to the same food. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39755436/" target="_blank"&gt;One recent study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition &lt;/em&gt;found that the same meal on two different days gave very different readings. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000929?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;Another small study&lt;/a&gt;, in the same journal, found that the continuous glucose monitor overestimated people's blood sugar levels compared with directly measuring it in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Second, the data can make people worry about — or even stop — eating healthy foods that cause normal blood sugar fluctuations. For example, Popp has a friend who started to worry about blueberries because they made her blood sugar rise slightly and then decline. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You don't want to start tagging foods as 'unhealthy' just because it led to what I perceived as a minuscule blood sugar spike."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Third, some people can have what looks like normal blood sugar levels but still have insulin resistance, Kennedy explains. In this case, their bodies compensate by overproducing insulin. To figure this out, you would need to see a doctor and have your insulin levels checked.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Continuous glucose is a handy metric," she says. "But it's only one metric, and you have to use it in the context of lab results and other signs and symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or can you get the same benefits from your daily diet? To get clarity on this, we got in touch with Dr. Karuna Chaturvedi, Head – Clinical Nutrition at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, and she says that the answer depends on your health condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Probiotic supplements contain live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your body. They support the body’s defence system and help strengthen immunity, especially by maintaining gut health,” says Dr. Chaturvedi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are probiotics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are live microorganisms—usually bacteria or yeast—that naturally live in your body, especially in your digestive tract. The most common strains found in supplements are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These “good bacteria” play a major role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and fighting off harmful microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oral probiotics help restore the balance of healthy gut bacteria,” Dr. Chaturvedi explains. “This not only aids digestion but also helps the body absorb nutrients and eliminate harmful germs.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probiotic supplements are often prescribed to people dealing with gut-related issues like bloating, and diarrhoea, or after a course of antibiotics, which can kill both harmful and helpful bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should you take them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While probiotics are generally safe, Dr. Chaturvedi says they’re not necessary for everyone. “If you’re healthy and your digestive system is working fine, there’s usually no need to take a supplement,” she advises. “A balanced diet with fermented foods can give you all the probiotics you need,” she further said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some people may experience side effects from supplements—such as bloating, mild digestive discomfort, or even negative interactions with medications, especially antibiotics. That’s why it’s always best to consult a doctor or dietitian before starting them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can food be just as effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! In fact, Dr. Chaturvedi recommends choosing natural food sources of probiotics over pills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Foods like yoghurt, buttermilk, cottage cheese, and pickles naturally contain beneficial bacteria,” she says. “These offer the same gut-friendly benefits without the risks that sometimes come with supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other fermented foods like idli, dosa batter, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha can also support gut health when consumed regularly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance is the key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While probiotic supplements can help in certain situations, they aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The best approach? Focus on eating a variety of nutritious foods, staying hydrated, and managing stress—because a healthy lifestyle supports a healthy gut.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Supplements can be helpful for people with specific health issues, but for most of us, a natural diet is enough,” Dr. Chaturvedi explains. “Your body has its own way of maintaining gut health—just give it the right fuel.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are powerful, but they’re not magic pills. Unless you have gut issues or your doctor recommends it, your kitchen already holds the best solution for good gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

Some come with hidden chemicals your skin won't thank you for. Choose wisely, read the label, and protect your skin the right way," Dr. Alok Chopra wrote in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr. Chopra warns, "Your sunscreen could be silently harming your hormones. Most commercial &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/regular-sunscreens-not-working-here-s-why-gel-sunscreens-are-better-plus-best-options-to-try-101744110723536.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="sunscreens"&gt;sunscreens&lt;/a&gt; are loaded with endocrine disruptors and cancer-causing chemicals. When you apply them to your skin, they get absorbed into your bloodstream. So, before buying sunscreen, you must read the ingredients carefully."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing a list of harmful ingredients, he adds, "If you see oxybenzone, methoxycinnamate, or avobenzone, do not buy it. These are endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with your body's hormone balance. Also, if the label says 'fragrance,' avoid it. That one word can hide a cocktail of chemicals like phthalates and parabens, both known to disrupt hormones and linked to long-term health risks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which sunscreens are safer and better for your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chopra recommends opting for mineral-based sunscreens with ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. "These sit on top of the skin rather than getting absorbed into your bloodstream. The newer formulations are lightweight, fast-absorbing, and offer a natural matte finish, without the white cast."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further emphasises the importance of choosing the right face sunscreen, saying, "When it comes to facial sunscreens, it's even more important to choose wisely. Facial skin is thinner, more absorbent, and often exposed daily. That means any toxins in your sunscreen have a quicker path into your bloodstream. Many commercial face sunscreens are marketed as lightweight or non-greasy, but they still contain the same &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/heres-how-harmful-chemicals-in-plastic-up-risk-of-postpartum-depression-101617597854709.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="harmful chemicals"&gt;harmful chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, look for mineral sunscreens labelled 'non-comedogenic', which means they won't clog your pores.

Now, most children in rich countries are cured.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, when I’d hear the words childhood leukemia, I’d picture a young child who suddenly became seriously ill, and whose parents were told their child had only a few years to live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d wonder how a child might grasp the idea of limited time, or how painful it must have been to face the possibility of missing out on growing up, discovering who they are, and forming deep friendships. It would also be a tragic experience for their family, friends, and classmates, who might struggle to understand what’s happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This picture, reflected in films, books, and television, depicts what used to be a grim reality. Childhood leukemia was fatal for the vast majority of children who developed it in the past. Before the 1970s, fewer than 10% of children diagnosed with the disease survived five years after diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But since then, this outlook has improved dramatically. In North America and Europe, around 85% now survive that long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-1" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What made this dramatic change possible?

This article focuses on leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the chart below, you can see the reduction in cancer death rates in the United States among children of different ages. The decline has been particularly large for leukemia, with a 14-fold drop, but we’ve also made much progress on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-in-children-under-10-years-old" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other, less common childhood cancers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-block__image-caption col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explore the data for other countries in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-in-children-under-10-years-old?country=~USA" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;an interactive chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the tissue that produces blood cells. It develops when immature white blood cells grow out of control and crowd out healthy ones, leading to symptoms like fatigue, infections, easy bruising or bleeding, and pale skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While leukemia becomes more common with age, it’s the most frequent cancer in children, making up about a quarter of all childhood cancer cases in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; One reason may be that blood-forming tissues are especially active during childhood, when the body grows quickly and needs a steady supply of new blood cells to carry oxygen, fight infections, and form clots. Many of these cells also have short lifespans, and this stage of life is a crucial period for immune system development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-3" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is very demanding for the bone marrow, which must constantly produce new cells. Each time a cell divides, there’s a small chance of a DNA error, and the more divisions that occur, the greater the chance that some of these errors will lead to cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two main types of leukemia in children. The most common is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which starts in early lymphoid cells. The other is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which begins in other blood-forming cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-4" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most childhood leukemia cases result from genetic mutations that develop spontaneously during this rapid cell division, often occurring before birth, while others are due to inherited genetic mutations, which are less common.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-5" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; While several environmental exposures have been investigated, there hasnʼt been consistent evidence for any environmental causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-6" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="childhood-leukemia-has-become-much-more-treatable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Childhood leukemia has become much more treatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#childhood-leukemia-has-become-much-more-treatable"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Survival rates for children with leukemia have risen dramatically in the last 50 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The chart below plots overall survival rates — the share of children still alive after a given time since their diagnosis. The data comes from trials by the Children’s Oncology Group, which has enrolled tens of thousands of children since the 1960s, and now includes over half of all children with leukemia in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The top panel displays this for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while the bottom panel shows acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the top panel, you can see that in the 1960s, only around 14% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survived at least five years. Despite initially improving upon treatment, most relapsed and died soon after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the 2010s, the chances of survival had increased dramatically: 94% of children survived at least five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some might wonder whether treatment only delays death rather than being a cure. However, researchers have also analyzed survival rates over the long term and found large improvements: the chart shows that most children are still alive ten years after diagnosis. After the initial years of treatment, their long-term survival is much more stable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bottom panel of the chart shows the improvement for acute myeloid leukemia. This subtype, which makes up about 25% of childhood leukemia cases, is more challenging to treat than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Survival rates for this form have also improved, though not quite as dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1970s, just 14% of children with acute myeloid leukemia survived at least five years. Now, over 60% do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This improvement in survival reflects the impact of intensive treatment regimens. These treatments usually still involve years of intensive chemotherapy, which is often physically and mentally challenging and can cause long-term side effects. However, chronic health problems after treatment have become less common, and the long-term health of these children has improved significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-8" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This dramatic improvement in survival rates is reflected in the large declines in death rates we saw in the previous section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="coordination-drug-development-and-molecular-research-have-driven-progress-in-treating-leukemia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coordination, drug development, and molecular research have driven progress in treating leukemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#coordination-drug-development-and-molecular-research-have-driven-progress-in-treating-leukemia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may notice from the chart above that much of this progress has been continuous. Progress in treating leukemia hasn’t come from a single breakthrough but from a series of advances building on one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the 1940s, children with leukemia usually died within a few weeks of diagnosis, and only comfort care was available. The first chemotherapy agents — aminopterin and, later, 6-mercaptopurine — could briefly eliminate leukemia cells. They gave families hope, but the cancer almost always returned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-9" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="chemotherapy-is-better-tailored-to-each-child"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chemotherapy is better tailored to each child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#chemotherapy-is-better-tailored-to-each-child"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers identified more drugs during the 1950s and early 1960s. Then they took the next logical step: giving several medicines together as a combination and using cranial radiation on spinal fluid — that is, targeting the brain and spine with radiation to kill hidden cancer cells. This helped eliminate leukemia cells that remained in the central nervous system, and doctors began to notice that a small number of patients were being cured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 1960s and 1970s saw another breakthrough. Researchers tried “multi-phase” chemotherapy regimens, where treatment was given in four key stages — induction, consolidation, delayed intensification, and maintenance — typically over two to three years. Each phase uses combinations of chemotherapy drugs to eliminate leukemia cells and prevent relapse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-10" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; In clinical trials, these regimens were successful, seeing survival rates of more than 50%, and hospitals in both North America and Europe ran similar studies and adopted the regimen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1980s and early 1990s, researchers found that intensive chemotherapy directed at the spinal fluid could protect the brain just as well as cranial radiation, but with far fewer long-term side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the mid-1990s, it also became clear that a single regimen didn’t fit everyone. Large trials sorted children into risk groups (this is called “risk stratification”) based on their age, white blood cell counts, and early genetic findings. Researchers found that lighter chemotherapy could spare the low-risk group from side effects, while stronger chemotherapy could save many in the high-risk group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-12" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laboratory science then gave doctors even sharper diagnostic tools. For example, tests of “measurable residual disease”, which became widely used in the early 2000s, can spot a single leukemia cell among 10,000 normal cells and help guide further treatment — such as whether to dial treatment back or trigger extra therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-13" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this showed that large improvements came not just from inventing new drugs, but from optimizing how existing drugs were used. This included finding the right combinations and dosages for different risk groups, adjusting treatment timing and duration to minimize toxic side effects, and identifying subgroups that could safely receive less intensive chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how did researchers learn which treatment strategies work best?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A key reason was widespread collaboration in clinical trials and research networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Large collaborations made better research possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Childhood leukemia is rare, so it’s very unlikely that a single hospital will see enough cases to draw strong conclusions on its own. To overcome this, researchers formed large collaborative groups and enrolled thousands of children in research studies and clinical trials. These trials helped test which regimens were safer and more effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since then, research groups merged into even larger collaborations to run bigger clinical trials, like the Children’s Oncology Group in North America and the International BFM Study Group in Europe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-14" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Over 50% of children with leukemia in the US are enrolled in clinical trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; This coordination has been crucial in increasing survival rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has helped increase “statistical power” — the ability to detect differences between treatments. It also helped address another challenge: before these clinical trials, treatment was highly variable, with different doctors and hospitals using protocols that were often suboptimal, and survival rates varied widely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result was better treatment standards, refined chemotherapy regimens, and reduced harmful practices. One example I mentioned earlier was cranial irradiation, which was once commonly used to prevent leukemia from spreading to the brain. Although it was effective, it carried serious long-term risks, including cognitive impairment and growth problems. Based on the results of these trials, it has now been largely replaced by less toxic chemotherapy-based strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-15" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Breakthroughs in genetic and molecular research led to further progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advances in genetic and molecular research have also transformed the treatment of childhood leukemia. By uncovering which genetic mutations drove different subtypes of the disease, researchers could better identify which children were likely to benefit from standard therapy, and which needed more intensive chemotherapy or other types of treatment, as part of the “risk stratification” approach mentioned earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research also led to targeted drugs to block some children's specific cancer mutations. One prominent example was imatinib (“Gleevec”), a drug initially developed for chronic myeloid leukemia in adults. It blocks a mutant protein that triggers leukemia cells to multiply rapidly. Although only a small percentage of children with leukemia have this mutation, their survival used to be very poor, and they often needed bone marrow transplants. When imatinib was added to chemotherapy regimens in the 2000s, their survival improved dramatically, and many no longer needed a transplant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-15" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More recently, new immunotherapies have reshaped treatment, including CAR-T cell therapy and antibody therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-16" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="better-supportive-care-helped-children"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better supportive care helped children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#better-supportive-care-helped-children"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy get much of the attention, better supportive care has also been critical in treating childhood leukemia. This is important because chemotherapy can harm vital organs and suppress the immune system, so children need protection from infections, bleeding, and complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last few decades, new treatments and vaccines have helped protect children against these other complications, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article-block__list col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Routine platelet transfusions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the 1970s, low platelet counts caused fatal bleeds in the brain or gut during intensive chemotherapy. Once blood banks learned to collect and store platelet concentrates at room temperature, daily blood transfusions became practical and deaths fell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-17" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; to prevent and treat infections, which are a major cause of early deaths during chemotherapy. Recently, more treatments have been approved and added to standard care for leukemia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-18" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expanded use of vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to protect children with weakened immune systems. Over the past few decades, new vaccines — for example, against pneumococcal disease, chickenpox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(varicella), and rotavirus — have helped prevent common but potentially serious infections in children with cancer. Some vaccines are recommended for patients themselves, while others are for family members and caregivers to reduce the risk of passing infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stem cell transplantation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is still reserved for the hardest cases, but how it’s done has changed. Years ago, doctors performed transplants with full-body radiation and often reinfused the child’s cells — both practices raised long-term risks and could risk cancer cells sneaking back in. Today, they usually give high-dose chemotherapy instead of radiation, and use stem cells from another donor, which can also help hunt down remaining leukemia cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-19" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class="article-block__horizontal-rule col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For families today, a diagnosis of childhood leukemia is no longer the terrifying death sentence it once was. Most children now survive, complete treatment, return to school, and grow up being able to look forward to longer, healthier lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experience is still incredibly difficult. Hospital visits, harsh side effects, and long periods of uncertainty take a serious emotional toll. Not every child is cured, and there are long-term risks from treatment, though these have been reduced as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact of this progress is undeniable. Children now live longer and healthier, and their families can hope for and plan for the future in ways that weren’t possible just a few decades ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story of childhood leukemia shows how science, collaboration, and persistence can turn a deadly disease into a largely treatable one. In just decades, it has gone from one of the most feared childhood illnesses to one of the most treatable cancers, and it’s a model for what medical research can achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next big challenge is ensuring that these advances reach children everywhere. This article has focused on progress in high-income countries, but access to timely diagnosis and treatment is still limited in many parts of the world. Expanding access globally is essential so that every child, no matter where they live, has the chance to live a long life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continue reading on Our World in Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a class="article-block__prominent-link grid grid-cols-6 span-cols-6 col-start-5 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 grid-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 grid-sm-cols-12 prominent-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer"&gt;&lt;div class="col-sm-start-4 col-md-start-3 col-start-2 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;p class="prominent-link__heading-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3 class="h3-bold"&gt;HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-3-medium"&gt;HPV vaccines offer a rare opportunity to effectively eliminate one type of cancer.

He decided to donate her brain to science hoping to contribute to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The family contacted Biological Resource Center, a local company that brokered the donation of human bodies for research. Within the hour, BRC dispatched a driver to collect Doris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim signed a form authorizing medical research on his mother's body. Ten days later, Jim received his mother's cremated remains - but it turns out her ashes were made up of a singular arm sawn off from her body. The rest of her corpse had met a violent fate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doris' brain never was used for Alzheimer's research. Instead, her body became part of an Army experiment to measure damage caused by roadside bombs, reports &lt;a href="https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/i-donated-moms-body-alzheimers-35335687" target="_self" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;the Irish Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349829" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internal BRC and military records show that at least 20 other bodies were also used in the blast experiments without permission of the donors or their relatives, a violation of U.S. Army policy. Jim had also ticked a box specifically banning any kind of experiments on Doris. BRC sold donated bodies like Stauffer's for $5,893 each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim said: "She was strapped in a chair, and a detonation took place underneath her to get an idea of what the human body goes through when a vehicle is hit by an IED. There was wording on this paperwork about performing tests that may involve explosions, and we said, 'No'."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Army officials involved in the project said they never received the consent forms that donors or their families had signed. Rather, the officials said they relied on assurances from BRC that families had agreed to let the bodies be used in such experiments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349830" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;BRC, which sold more than 20,000 parts from some 5,000 human bodies over a decade, is no longer in business. Its former owner, Stephen Gore, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2022. In a statement to Reuters, Gore said that he always tried to honour the wishes of donors and sent consent forms when researchers requested them. Jim said of Gore "He didn't care about the families, he didn't care about the people."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim learned of the fate of his mother's body from a Reuters reporter and "curled his lip in anger and clutched his wife Lisa's arm. "We did right," Lisa reassured him. "They just did not honor our wishes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No federal law regulates body brokers like BRC, and no U.S. government agency monitors what happens to cadavers pledged for use in medical education and research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349827" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It is not illegal to sell a whole body or the parts of a body for research or education," said University of Iowa law professor Sheldon F. Kurtz, who helped modify the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, which has been adopted by 46 states. Although the act was updated in 2006, Kurtz said, "the issue of whole bodies or body parts for research or education never came up during our discussions."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, the body trade has become big business. Only one state, New York, keeps detailed records on the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the most recent data available, companies that did business in New York shipped at least 100,000 body parts across the country from 2011 to 2014. Reuters obtained the data, which have never been made public, from the state's health department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I feel foolish," said Jim. "I'm not a trusting person, but, you have no idea this is going on." Military officials said they took BRC's word that permission had been given. Records show at least 20 more bodies were blown up without consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Irish Mirror</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 06:05:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPN1BFcE1TRHp3MnM2cm11YVVoMzd4bk9rVDROZ1RIc0tfMWU0djlSNV9lVFk4VWRjeW15YzVySTM3RjhFa2lZNHUyLWpXWHFBV2tmZWFkNFkxOEozQWpTSkxBLWJHRE9VNmtxMElJT1FzczVLYTk0YXFIYk51X3puTjJnaWxad0tQbkHSAY8BQVVfeXFMUE1EWmRtaTJndE9FOEJzcFo4RFpXNFB3TTE3ODJyUUZuU1VhcDZwajNUVzdCYmhTQVAtTDVzQVl3VU1nak8xUDNjVDdrSjQ5dTliZGdCYUJZZ0RoaFRGaVh0elVObGhRbFhYXzUzLTBCa1hYNGl3aWJxV1VCLTY5SloyMXFKSWhoS0FqM1doOFU</guid></item><item><title>免费资金可以帮助人们远离毒品吗？这些程序正在尝试。-《波士顿环球报》 | Can free money help people stay off drugs?

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nothing stuck until Pagan, a 36-year-old personal caregiver from Revere, learned late last year of &lt;a href="https://healthcity.bmc.org/substance-use-disorder-program-offers-new-approach-stimulant-addiction-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://healthcity.bmc.org/substance-use-disorder-program-offers-new-approach-stimulant-addiction-treatment/"&gt;an innovative new &lt;/a&gt;initiative at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program that gave her a financial incentive to stay sober. Every time she took a drug test that was free of cocaine, showed up for a recovery group meeting, or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;engaged in physical exercise, Pagan was rewarded with $5 loaded onto a debit card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While modest, the payments were enough to motivate Pagan to keep coming back, week after week, to a program that taught her new strategies for controlling her cravings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you’re living on the edge, sometimes you need something — even if it’s small — to feel better about yourself and your future," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pagan is among hundreds of people addicted to stimulants in New England who are part of a bold but debated experiment: giving financial rewards to people who abstain from illicit drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In cities across the region, treatment providers are embracing the concept of monetary awards as they seek new ways to combat a troubling surge in the use of psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The approach is known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034391/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034391/"&gt;“contingency management&lt;/a&gt;" and it’s based on a simple premise: that giving people tangible rewards for staying abstinent can rewire the brain, so people associate not using stimulants with positive outcomes. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208958" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208958"&gt;An abundance of scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; and clinical trials have found the approach highly effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Policy makers are banking on the intervention to help address a gaping hole in the substance use treatment system. There are no targeted medications for the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf"&gt;3.8 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are addicted to stimulants, as there are for opioids and alcohol, so stimulant addictions are among the hardest to treat. Compared with opioids, such as fentanyl and heroin, stimulants are a slow killer. Sustained use can lead to heart failure, strokes, and &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/stimulants#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20Health%20Risks,-Chronic%20meth%20use&amp;amp;text=High%20blood%20pressure%20leading%20to,or%20years%20after%20meth%20use)" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/stimulants#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20Health%20Risks,-Chronic%20meth%20use&amp;amp;text=High%20blood%20pressure%20leading%20to,or%20years%20after%20meth%20use)"&gt;higher rates of paranoia, anxiety, and hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;, studies have found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People have been brainwashed into thinking that depriving people and letting them `hit bottom’ is the only way for somebody to get better, and contingency management flies in the face of that,” said Deirdre Calvert, director of the state Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Substance Addiction Services. “Most importantly, it works.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While offering people small rewards for abstinence dates to the 1980s, the approach has been slow to catch on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One of the biggest obstacles has been the moral objection to the idea of paying people to stay off drugs — which, critics argue, they should be doing anyway. Legal concerns have been another barrier. Treatment providers have long worried they could run afoul of &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/contingency-management-highly-effective-treatment-substance-use-disorders-and-legal" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/contingency-management-highly-effective-treatment-substance-use-disorders-and-legal"&gt;the federal anti-kickback law&lt;/a&gt; if they are seen to be enticing people with gifts. For these reasons, private and public insurance programs generally have been unwilling to cover the treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet attitudes began to change a few years ago amid a troubling new reality. Many people were taking cocaine and meth without realizing it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/fentanyl.html#:~:text=Fentanyl%20is%20a%20powerful%20synthetic,illegally%20made%20fentanyl%20(IMF)." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/fentanyl.html#:~:text=Fentanyl%20is%20a%20powerful%20synthetic,illegally%20made%20fentanyl%20(IMF)."&gt;laced with fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic opioid that is lethal even in tiny amounts. In Massachusetts, cocaine began appearing in more than 50 percent of opioid-related deaths, according to state health data. The trend has been particularly &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/30/metro/boston-black-men-dying-drug-overdoses-alarming-rates/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/30/metro/boston-black-men-dying-drug-overdoses-alarming-rates/"&gt;devastating in communities of color&lt;/a&gt;, where cocaine is still the drug of choice among many Black men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At the same time, states received the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-the-ags-statewide-opioid-settlements-with-opioid-industry-defendants" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-the-ags-statewide-opioid-settlements-with-opioid-industry-defendants"&gt;first wave of billions of dollars in payments&lt;/a&gt; from the pharmaceutical industry for their role in the deadly opioid epidemic. Flush with cash, state health officials began looking for new ways to provide treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So in 2021, Boston Medical Center received a $1.43 million grant from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to launch &lt;a href="" target="_blank" rel="" title=""&gt;the state’s first contingency management program&lt;/a&gt;, known as START. People who participated would come in once a week to complete a urine test and, if it’s negative for stimulants, receive $5 on a debit card. Attend a group meeting, visit a nurse, or do a workout at a gym, and participants could make another $5. Those who stick with the program a year can make up to $75, and participate in drawings for prizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Interest in the program has far exceeded expectations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Justin Alves, co-medical director for the START program and a nurse educator with the &lt;a href="https://www.addictiontraining.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.addictiontraining.org/"&gt;Grayken Center for Addiction Training and Technical Assistance&lt;/a&gt;, said they expected 60 people to enroll in the first two years. Within six months, they had nearly doubled that number. People were driving from more than two hours away to attend the support meetings in Boston. To accommodate the demand, Boston Medical Center expanded the program to clinical sites in Lawrence, New Bedford, and Springfield, and at the &lt;a href="https://www.bhchp.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bhchp.org/"&gt;Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program’s&lt;/a&gt; main office in Boston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All told, 660 patients with stimulant use disorders have participated in the program since 2021; and more than 50 percent have been people of color, according to Boston Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Organizers of the program are now looking to tap opioid settlement funds to expand the incentives to $300 to $500 per person per year, consistent with scientific studies showing that larger amounts are more effective in promoting abstinence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The $75 was enough to get people to come to group [meetings],” Alves said. “By the time the $75 ran out, we had nurse-patient relationships with people and that’s what has made the program blossom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Behavioral scientists said the programs are effective in part because the prizes act much like stimulants do — by increasing dopamine levels in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The US Department of Veterans Affairs was &lt;a href="https://news.va.gov/64870/how-va-uses-contingency-management-help-veterans-stay-drug-free/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://news.va.gov/64870/how-va-uses-contingency-management-help-veterans-stay-drug-free/"&gt;among the pioneers&lt;/a&gt; of the concept. Since 2011, the agency has provided financial awards for negative urine tests to more than 8,000 veterans struggling with substance use disorders. Out of 105,000 urine samples provided by these veterans during their treatment, 92 percent tested negative for the target drugs, primarily stimulants, according to a spokesperson for the VA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The concept is also taking hold in Maine, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/health/meth-maine-fentanyl.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;particularly hard hit&lt;/a&gt; by meth-related overdoses. Since last June, &lt;a href="https://www.mainehealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mainehealth.org/"&gt;MaineHealth&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s largest health care network, has launched or expanded &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/caroline/FMfcgzQbfVGtklzSRVGkVKjWVcFJLcpm?projector=1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/caroline/FMfcgzQbfVGtklzSRVGkVKjWVcFJLcpm?projector=1"&gt;contingency management programs&lt;/a&gt; at several locations. So far, more than 120 patients have participated and between 64 and 66 percent of urine drug screens have been negative for stimulants, with missed appointments counting as a positive test, according to MaineHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And in Vermont, &lt;a href="https://howardcenter.org/about-us/about/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://howardcenter.org/about-us/about/"&gt;the Howard Center&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit community health agency in Burlington, last October began enrolling people facing charges related to their substance use that offers $20 for every negative drug test up to a maximum of $800. Since then, every person who engaged in the program has delivered twice-weekly urine tests that are drug-free — a 100 percent success rate. Several of the participants have been sober long enough to regain custody of their children, the organization said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some treatment providers are wary of giving prizes that they say patients could then sell or trade for drugs. Yet that hasn’t emerged as a problem, say clinicians and researchers. The Howard Center tracks how participants spend the rewards and found they largely use the money to buy food, gas, and other basic items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rosario Malcolm-Testaverde credits a contingency management program with potentially saving his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He spent 15 years addicted to crystal methamphetamine, bouncing in and out of hospital emergency departments, before he discovered the Boston Health Care for the Homeless program. He didn’t need the money, yet the weekly prizes gave him an incentive to show up at group meetings. There, he encountered a community of people who understood the powerful pull of crystal meth and its dangerous side effects — including paranoia and auditory hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I felt fully recognized as a human being,” said Malcolm-Testaverde, 36. “And the rewards system helped replace the dopamine hit I would get [from crystal meth].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At noon on a recent Monday, the mood was upbeat as Pagan and a dozen other people in recovery filed into a brightly lit conference room at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless office at 780 Albany St.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One by one, members introduced themselves and talked about what they were looking forward to in their lives. An older man named John described the daily challenge of staying sober when, each day, he encountered people using cocaine outside his apartment building in Cambridge’s Central Square.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among the last to speak, Pagan proudly announced to the group that she had just received word of a new job opportunity and was brushing up her resume — something she never would have imagined just a couple of years ago, when she was still living on the streets and using drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Hopefully a door opens because I feel like I’m ready,” Pagan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In an instant, everyone around the table burst into applause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Vegetables often have less fibre than fruits, nuts, beans, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. About 90 percent of Americans are &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/woman-shares-how-she-lost-86-kg-of-fat-and-built-muscle-protein-is-king-but-fibre-is-also-really-important-vegetarian-101748748233674.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fibre-deficient"&gt;fibre-deficient&lt;/a&gt;. This trend of insufficient fibre intake is common worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. More fibre = better weight control, cholesterol, reflux, and gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Soluble fibre helps calm diarrhoea; insoluble fibre helps with constipation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. Add fibre slowly - some gas and bloating at first is totally normal. Your gut bugs are just adjusting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Psyllium is the best-studied fibre supplement, especially helpful for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also Read | &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/how-to-protect-gut-and-liver-health-in-your-20s-30s-40s-50s-and-60s-gastroenterologist-shares-tips-101749199641864.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="How to protect gut and liver health in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s?

Gastroenterologist shares tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why is fibre important for gut health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now arises, why is fibre considered an important supplement for our gut health? According to the Mayo Clinic, dietary fibre increases the weight and size of stool and softens it. In general, bulky stool is easier to pass, and this lowers the chance of constipation. If you have loose, watery stools, fibre may help make them solid. That's because fibre absorbs water and adds bulk to stool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, according to the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="National Institutes of Health (NIH),"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH),&lt;/a&gt; dietary fibre is fermented by the human gut microbiota, producing beneficial microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

            When Ayva Peña got a phone at age 10, her interest in skin care skyrocketed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700023j6n3rujwgyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first, she bonded over it with her mother, Giselle Peña. Together, they would have spa days with face masks and take occasional shopping trips to try out new products. But when the Rhode Island mother found a $300 anti-aging face cream in Ayva’s medicine drawer, it gave her pause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700033j6n9rchvn4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I got very upset. … She’s 15 years old,” Peña said. “It says it makes your skin ageless, improves fine lines, wrinkles and firmness. I was like, ‘This is not for you, girl.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700043j6nbjsc85wj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peña is among a growing number of parents &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/12/style/tweens-skin-care-wellness"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; about how content on social media platforms is influencing children and teens into trying out elaborate, often age-inappropriate skin care products. Now, a &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/06/tiktok-teen-skin-care-routines-are-harmful/?fj=1#tab-panel1" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Pediatrics may confirm those parents’ worries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700053j6nykq6b0w9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing beauty routines from 100 TikTok videos by content creators ages 7 through 18, researchers found an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients among their regimens, many of which carry a risk of developing skin allergies and increased sun sensitivity. Only a quarter of the lengthy product lists contained sunscreens, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700063j6nou29ljul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of (children) featured in these videos didn’t have any visible acne. They had perfect, clear skin,” said Dr. Molly Hales, the first study author and a board-certified dermatologist in the department of dermatology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “For many of them, the harms probably outweigh any potential benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700073j6nyh9hfu7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between the dozens of daily serums, moisturizers, toners and cleansers featured in the videos, the average routine was six steps long, costing about $168 — with some more than $500 — for one month’s worth of product, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700083j6ngr5gntc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have kids waking up at 5:30 in the morning on a school day to have enough time to layer on these complicated regimens, I think it becomes less about health and more (about) pursuing an idea of beauty that is unrealistic and problematic,” said Hales, who is also a postdoctoral research fellow at Feinberg. The findings raise serious ethical questions about how social media content influences young people in their everyday lives, she added
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700093j6nkn69iu8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A TikTok spokesperson, noting that this type of content is “common across all media,” said the platform is only for users ages 13 and older, and any creators suspected to be under 13 are removed. Additionally, they said that TikTok works with third-party doctors and experts in adolescent development to implement safeguarding policies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000a3j6nue36falx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the studied skin care routines lacked a form of sunscreen but contained products that could increase sun sensitivity and risk of skin cancer, the authors found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000b3j6nb4fc59vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Common active ingredients found in recommended skin products were alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs, mild chemical exfoliants that help remove top layers of skin cells, Hales said. While they have the intended effect of evening skin tone and creating a more youthful appearance, they are known to make the skin more vulnerable to the sun’s ultraviolet rays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000c3j6nsbtow180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would recommend daily sunscreen use for all ages and regimens, but especially for those using these (AHAs),” Hales said. “It’s a necessary step to prevent permanent skin damage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000d3j6n426hne1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those AHAs, as well as vitamin-based ingredients such as niacinamide, are also considered potential irritants, carrying side effects such as redness and dryness, especially with overuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000e3j6n4vwfv49j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many cases, the girls may not have realized they were applying the same active ingredient again and again, which just increases the risk of irritation,” said Dr. Tara Lagu, senior study author and adjunct lecturer of medicine and medical social sciences at Feinberg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000f3j6n3897q6yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half the products contained fragrance — a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis — and 20 other inactive ingredients that are known allergens, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000g3j6nucebr1xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Misinformation is a big issue on social media, but especially for these content creators younger than 18,” said Dr. Sonal Shah, a board-certified dermatologist in Cleveland and director of pediatric dermatology at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s Hospital. Shah was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000h3j6nkop7rdt7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are sources that perhaps don’t have a scientific background and are not well read in the science behind a lot of these products, how they work, or what risks they carry,” Shah said, adding that there are board-certified dermatologists on TikTok that could offer more credible advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000i3j6nxoujsmys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other concerning trends Shah has seen in her practice, but were not mentioned in the study, include mechanical exfoliants, such as scrubbing wands or cleansers containing plastic microbeads, which are often too rough for facial skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000j3j6n1kj15vhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also noted that many of the creators were offering tips relevant to those with lighter complexions, which may exclude the unique skin care considerations of darker complexions while perpetuating harmful ideals of “brighter” skin associated with whiteness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000k3j6nlh2encw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Shah and Hales recommend children under 18 who are not dealing with acne use a gentle cleanser with no active ingredients, paired with a fragrance-free moisturizer and a daily mineral sunscreen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In general, children will not benefit from anti-aging products that promise to boost skin elasticity or eliminate fine lines, Shah said. In these young ages, collagen production is at the highest it will ever be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000m3j6nvwnu447l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As children reach puberty, however, they may produce more acne-causing hormones. In those cases, Shah recommends adding an over-the-counter product with salicylic acid or a low percentage of benzoyl peroxide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000n3j6n199byr74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their skin care does not have to be complicated and does not have to be very expensive,” Shah said. Parents “can talk to a board-certified dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist if there are skin concerns that are significant or don’t respond to over-the-counter treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000o3j6n4mscjgvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, if parents are concerned about their child’s skin care regimen, they should talk about it, said Jennifer Harriger, a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies childhood development, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000p3j6nlhc57676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that it is always best to have open conversations with children about the messages they see on social media as well as their own intentions behind purchasing particular skincare products,” said Harriger, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000q3j6nygov5upo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to keep an open mind, understanding the social dimension of youth beauty and wellness content, Hales said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000r3j6nrb2ee095@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These videos show a kind of playful self-expression that’s very appealing to this age group,” Hales said. “These are girls who are just starting to develop their own sense of independent identity, how they present (themselves) in the world, their gender identity, and in many cases what it means to be a girl in our society.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

It certainly wouldn’t be something that the young mother, who was eight months pregnant with twins at the time, would have recalled 25 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But today, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Kalafus remembers that childish fumble as the moment she knew, on a cellular level, that her fears that something was terribly wrong with her were well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: ‘It was like being stabbed. I nearly hit the ceiling because I was in such pain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-7bae9640-42f7-11f0-b8b3-4d00d0342359"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the diagnosis was a vindication of sorts, brought no satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus had been raising concerns over what she felt certain were abnormal symptoms throughout her pregnancy only to have them repeatedly overlooked by her doctor who, she claims, dismissed them as the baseless fears of a ‘hysterical woman.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 56, Kalafus is chronicling her story in her new memoir, ‘Flood,’ published by Woodhall Press. She believes patients who can sense something wrong in their own bodies often know better than medical professionals in whom they place their trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine Kalafus, now 56, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer two days before she was forced to deliver her twins early&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus shows off her large baby bump in December 2000 — a few weeks before she her life-threatening diagnosis of triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus became pregnant in the Spring of 2000, a year after her husband, Greg, confessed he'd had an affair with another woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that they were determined to save their marriage and put the infidelity behind them so when she conceived twins she hoped it would be a fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when Kalafus was five-and-a-half months pregnant, she began experiencing an unpleasant sensation like someone was sticking pins or fine needles into her right breast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She touched the breast and felt a hard, walnut-size lump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery rang alarm bells in her head. ‘I immediately thought of my paternal grandmother who died of breast cancer at 35 when I was ten,’ she said. ‘Then I reassured myself that I was only 31 so it’s unlikely to be that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She decided to mention it during a routine check-up three days later with her OBGYN — for whom she uses the pseudonym Dr Robb in her book — who had delivered her first child in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She saw Dr Robb every three weeks because she was carrying twins and there was an elevated risk to the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Kalafus, her doctor seemed more interested in measuring the size of her stomach than listening to the concerns she was raising about her breast. He looked at the lump, she said, and touched it lightly before concluding, ‘It’s nothing. It's just a clogged milk duct.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back Kalafus, a writer based in Connecticut, recognizes the blind faith she placed in the medic simply because he was the authority figure in the room. She doubted herself, not him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I saw his framed diplomas on the wall and didn’t question him,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t remember lactating until she had given birth to her first child but she reasoned that perhaps she was ‘starting early’ because this time she was having twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor sent her away without giving any advice on how to deal with the clogged duct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, three weeks later, and still troubled by the persistent symptom, she asked about the lump once more. Again, the doctor dismissed her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus she raised the matter at her three subsequent consultations, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she started to produce colostrum (the earliest nutrient-dense version of breast milk) which, she thought, backed up his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mid-November, Dr. Robb agreed to measure the lump. He noted that it was bigger, but still insisted it was a clogged milk duct that they should ‘just keep an eye on.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He was like a stuck record,’ she said, adding that she felt belittled and patronized. Kalafus said, ‘I felt like a little child.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus' identical twins Parker and Spencer at 18 months old. They were born by C-section on January 4, 2001 — the same day that their mom underwent a lumpectomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus and her twins when they were ten months. She was still recovering from her intensive seven-month chemotherapy and radiation treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, it bothered her that this pregnancy felt so different from her first, and she wasn’t convinced that the difference could be put down to the fact that she was expecting twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t share her worries with her husband, Greg, who was also 56. She said, ‘I’m not someone who likes to make people worry unnecessarily and so I muscled through myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Besides, we were both busy at work, running a household with a young child and managing the bills.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the agony that she experienced when her young son accidentally elbowed her that day was something she just couldn’t brush off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She booked the first available appointment with Dr. Robb, and by January 2, 2001 she was sitting in his consulting room once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unbelievably, her words still fell on deaf ears. While Kalafus told the obstetrician what had happened, he shuffled paperwork and appeared to listen only half-heartedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little wonder that Kalafus felt desperate and unheard. Thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who seemed far more engaged in Kalafus’s story than the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was leaving when the nurse called her back. There was a general surgeon’s office over the road, she explained, and they had managed to squeeze her in for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seen right away, and the surgeon performed a needle biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robb called that night after dinner. He had received the results. ‘He didn’t even say “Hello,”’ Kalafus says. ‘He said the tests were positive for cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine, then 33, with her three sons, twins Parker and Spencer, 17 months and their older brother, Trevor, six, in 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barely pausing for breath, the doctor told her that the babies would have to ‘come out,’ adding, ‘We don’t know where else it might be.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Kalafus and her husband, Greg, were left to absorb the shocking news overnight before driving to the hospital the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, the nervous mother-to-be underwent a battery of routine tests such as pre-surgery blood work – and learned that the lump that had started all those weeks ago the size of a nut, had grown to the size of a golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the absence of an oncologist because everything had happened so quickly, it was left to Dr. Robb to deliver the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said she needed an immediate C-section ahead of a lumpectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer and Parker were born on January 4 – at 37 weeks they were considered full term for twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there was no time for Kalafus to bathe in any post-birth relief or bond with newborn babies. They were taken away to the baby unit before she could even hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile their mother, who had undergone the caesarian under an epidural was now administered a general anesthetic for the lumpectomy which followed immediately on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she came round after the two-hour surgery Kalafus had a ‘giant crater’ in her chest where the lump had once been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was taken for a biopsy in case the cancer had spread. Mercifully, it hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was reunited with her twins and their older brother in her hospital room when, woozy from the anesthetic, she became confused when the babies were wheeled inside in their lucite bassinets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, when mom put them in my arms, I could smell that new baby smell and realized they were mine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus met her newborns just a few hours after having breast cancer surgery. At first she was too woozy to realize they belonged to her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus today. She has undergone annual mammograms since contracting breast cancer at the age of just 31. Thankfully, it had not metastasized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was discharged with the newborns — who were a healthy weight — four days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, around a week after that, out of an abundance of caution, doctors took a number of lymph nodes from under her armpit as a pre-emptive measure to ensure the disease had not metastasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus later found out that she had triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma – a particularly aggressive cancer that is not responsive to hormone therapies, often diagnosed at a young age and prone to reoccurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Spencer and Parker were watched by her mother and aunts. They came to the family's historic house — nicknamed 'The Witch House' as a reference to its sharply pointed center gable resembling a witch's hat — while she underwent more testing and then chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They did a miraculous job, but I felt robbed of bonding time with my twins,’ Kalafus said, adding, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled her oncologist said he wanted to get her to point that she got to see her children graduate high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As difficult as that was to hear, Kalafus said: ‘I actually thought it was one of the most insensitive things I'd ever heard. I wasn’t just a mother, but an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Not only that, but I was also only 31 years old.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A six-month course of chemotherapy began in early February and her hair started to fall out after the first treatment. Next, she had 30 sessions of radiation on consecutive days of the week, with Sunday off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the toxic drugs flooding her system there was no question of her breast-feeding the twins as she’d done Trevor. In fact, her illness, and its treatment, impacted every part of those first few precious months with her newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus. Recalling her cancer treatment after her twins were born, she said, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The so-called 'Witch House' in Connecticut where Kalafus lived with her family at the time she was pregnant with the twins and later had cancer treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was often too weak from the treatment to pick them up,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and Greg sat Trevor down to tell him what was happening. ‘We said, “Mommy needs medication to make feel her better,” and he accepted that.’ The little boy even helped her shave her head to neaten things up after most of her hair had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now aged 24 and 29, her sons are wholly relieved their mother, who still has mammograms every year, has not suffered a recurrence of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus, Dr Robb — whom she didn’t challenge directly — never once expressed any remorse for his inaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she didn’t think of taking legal action against him, partly because of the cost. ‘Nor am I a great believer in blaming people who make mistakes,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, today Kalafus advocates for women — especially expectant mothers — to stand up for themselves in the face of medical arrogance or indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘It's one thing for the grocery clerk not to believe you when you say the zucchini is bad, but it's another thing for a doctor to dismiss you. One is just an annoyance. The other is a possible death sentence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                            Estimated read time: 3-4
                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOOELE — The more people there are who are diagnosed with dementia, the more people there will be who want to have a better understanding of the condition, health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooele County Health Department Aging Services Division is not immune from seeing an increase in those looking for a better understanding. As such, it has created a series of workshops intended to support those caring for loved ones with dementia as well as those interested in gaining a better understanding of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you do not need to be a Tooele County resident to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really want to share what we have, especially if we can help other people," said Amy Hoftiezer, the director of aging services for Tooele County. "We are seeing more people ... so we want to help how we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often used interchangeably with Alzheimer's disease, dementia is slightly different, referring to a group of impairments that affect at least two brain functions. Memory loss, hampered thinking abilities, an increased state of confusion and more are examples of the impairments found with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's accounts for a majority of diagnoses that fall under dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic, the Alzheimer's Association and the World Health Organization, each of which estimates that between 60-70% of those with dementia are diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confusion is only one example of why programs are available for those who want more education on dementia, the county health department says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging specialists across the country — from the Alzheimer's Association to the Mayo Clinic, the National Institute on Aging to the Tooele County Health Department — also remind Americans that as the baby boomers continue to age, some of them will also be diagnosed with dementia, increasing the numbers of those who struggle with, are afraid of and who need more information about the ailment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff at the Tooele County Health Department's Aging Services Division also note that they are averaging 35 people in their classes and workshops, but most of those in attendance are in their 50s and older. Younger people may be busy with work or school, or they are not ready to think about dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The closer you get to something affecting you, the more you want to learn about it," said Sarah Obray, the aging services gerontologist. "I think that's what is happening ... as people get older, they want to know about everything. And they want to know the signs and symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department offers classes focused on educating participants about the latest research and providing a general understanding of dementia. They also host a support group specifically for caregivers,  a friend or family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="divbox"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on programs, support groups and more sponsored by the Tooele County Health Department's Aging Services Division: Call 435-277-2300 or visit &lt;a href="https://tooelehealth.org/aging-services/" target="_blank"&gt;tooelehealth.org/aging-services/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dementia Live" is one such program that gives participants the opportunity to come as close as they can to experiencing dementia. Goggles impair the vision, earphones limit hearing and various activities allow participants to consider what it may be like for those with the ailment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programs also give participants a chance to engage with other people who may be in the same boat — wanting to learn about dementia and/or taking care of someone who suffers from it. They can discover that they are not alone and maybe build friendships with others in the workshops, staffers note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way the staff sees it, if you are lucky, you will be aging, so we can all benefit from learning this information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aging impacts us all," Obray said.
