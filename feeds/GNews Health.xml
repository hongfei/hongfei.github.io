While common symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and unexplained weight loss, recent research shows that certain leg symptoms may appear first. Patients may experience pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the legs, which can serve as early warning signs of pancreatic cancer. Recognising these subtle indicators is vital for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving survival rates. With pancreatic cancer causing over a million deaths globally each year, awareness of both traditional and early leg symptoms is crucial for prevention and early intervention. This aggressive cancer often spreads quickly to nearby organs and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection and awareness even more essential.

Pain in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unexplained pain in the legs can be a subtle yet significant warning sign. This discomfort may arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the context of pancreatic cancer, DVT can occur due to the body's altered clotting mechanisms, which are influenced by the presence of cancerous cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Swelling in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained swelling in one or both legs, especially if it develops suddenly, can indicate the presence of a blood clot or other circulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pancreatic cancer patients, such swelling may be linked to DVT or the compression of blood vessels by tumour growth, leading to impaired blood flow. Persistent swelling accompanied by pain, redness, or warmth should be evaluated promptly, as early detection can prevent serious complications and improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Redness in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness or a reddish hue in the skin of the legs can be a sign of inflammation or infection. In the case of DVT associated with pancreatic cancer, the affected area may appear red due to increased blood flow as the body attempts to combat the clot. This discolouration is often accompanied by warmth, tenderness, and mild swelling, indicating underlying circulatory issues that require immediate medical evaluation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Warmth in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation of warmth in the legs, particularly around the swollen or painful areas, can indicate inflammation. This warmth is often a response to the body's immune system reacting to the clot or tumour. In pancreatic cancer, such symptoms may be among the first to manifest, preceding more typical signs like jaundice or abdominal pain. Persistent warmth accompanied by redness, tenderness, or swelling should not be ignored, as it may signal deep vein thrombosis or tumour-related vascular complications requiring prompt medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-breakthrough-scientists-discover-protein-that-could-stop-tumour-growth-in-the-pancreas/articleshow/124158628.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover protein that could stop tumour growth in the pancreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do these symptoms matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these leg symptoms, especially when they occur without an obvious cause, should not be dismissed. They may serve as early indicators of pancreatic cancer, prompting timely medical evaluation and intervention.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roanoke, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; — As a 10-year-old, Autumn Bushman loved to perform. The fourth-grade cheerleader from Salem, Virginia, was a bundle of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She really turned my living room into a dance floor," her mother, Summer Bushman, told CBS News. "She never sat still...She really did care about others more than she cared about herself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the past couple of years, Summer says Autumn was bullied in school over her braces. The abuse also continued after school on her smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, at the age of 10, Autumn died by suicide at night in her bedroom. Records show she was looking at her phone's screen just before it happened, Summer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer told CBS News her daughter would take her phone to bed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had questioned that a couple of times, and she fought back and said, 'Mom, I need my alarm,'" Summer said. "And every single morning when I'd wake her up, she had her alarm going off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from researchers at Virginia Tech shows nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines are linked to teen suicide attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/study-sheds-light-on-overdose-suicide-attempts-among-youth-and-w.html?utm_campaign=organicVTunirel&amp;amp;utm_medium=Virginia+Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=cmpgn_soc&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawNneY5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxanNqNXVTMXlNeUlsSmpGAR737BMQJHB22mLCWTHsWIJtbwcl6ubTD5zzqasiJYE_BhaVrtbisodKMXhA0g_aem_O5CsolpF6bKgGiuJh9YUhA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study examined&lt;/a&gt; data of children ages 12 to 17 who had been admitted to a hospital after attempting suicide by intentionally overdosing. It found that about two-thirds of those overdosed after 8 p.m., and approximately three out of four were on screens right before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very distracting and disturbs your sleep," Dr. Abhishek Reddy, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who conducted the research, said of screen use before bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddy added that it is "pretty dangerous" for bullied children to take their phones to bed at night "because during the daytime, you can talk to people, you can talk to school counselors, you can talk to your family members, friends. But at nighttime, all that access is cut off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends keeping phones out of bedrooms, practicing good sleep hygiene, and reducing access to all medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I come in here and I think, you know, it's been six months since she's been gone, it's been seven months since she's been gone.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38tqux00aj26oz4x4668v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist. Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00063b6n8lk4gh5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00073b6n4kvi97pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23458883/" target="_blank"&gt;grew a tooth &lt;/a&gt;from human and mouse cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00083b6nx32ub98d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, she led a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532305/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00093b6ne7zrtypj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000a3b6n6eksaw8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000b3b6nksdqhjnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000c3b6nphp2ih3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000d3b6nyj8yc13m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000e3b6nrxthzi6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000g3b6n7cdnstyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000h3b6nlyrkjpm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh39e1pm00153b6nipf3rorz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000i3b6nxvf73jgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000j3b6nhcte4hnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000k3b6n7zilp2pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/04/24/pigs-can-regrow-their-adult-teeth-what-if-humans-could-too" target="_blank"&gt;in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000l3b6nuc19zrso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, &lt;a href="https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/teaming-up-for-living-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;has successfully grown&lt;/a&gt; dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000m3b6n1uyj51tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The insulin nasal spray, which delivers insulin straight to the brain, has also been shown to keep brain cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the US, the trial shows some early signs of progress in maintaining brain health in those at risk of Alzheimer's. It enrolled 47 older adults aged 55 to 85 years, 42 of whom completed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, or were cognitively fine but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu387"&gt;showed signs of molecular changes&lt;/a&gt; linked to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were given either empagliflozin alone, the insulin spray on its own, both medications together, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;or a placebo&lt;/a&gt;, for four weeks. The trial was too small to detect any  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="178152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; differences between the groups (its main aim was testing safety); however, some trends were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we found that empagliflozin, an established diabetes and heart medication, reduced markers of brain injury while restoring blood flow in critical brain regions," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Suzanne Craft from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also confirmed that delivering insulin directly to the brain with a newly validated device enhances cognition, neurovascular health, and immune function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-178155 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-639x675.jpg 639w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-600x634.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the benefits seen with empagliflozin (EMPA-Only) was signs of less tau build-up in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Erichsen et al., &lt;em&gt;A&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a diabetes drug, empagliflozin improves the way the body handles glucose and sodium. This has a lot of further effects, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stress on cells, better energy efficiency, and improved insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the medication was shown to reduce the levels of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that we know can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial"&gt;form harmful clumps&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's brains. It also had benefits in terms of blood flow and cholesterol levels, and several other biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insulin nasal spray was chosen because insulin resistance has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-spray-may-slow-alzheimers-disease-study-in-mice-suggests"&gt;previously been linked&lt;/a&gt; to Alzheimer's, and previous research shows insulin's effects on brain cells can help improve immune responses, white matter structure, and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, participants given the insulin spray saw better scores on cognitive tests measuring memory and thinking. Through brain scans, the researchers observed benefits in white matter connectivity and blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;linked to memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body's metabolism, or the way it turns fuel into energy, is crucial to good health, and these treatments focus more on that, rather than some of the later, end-stage effects of Alzheimer's we see in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that targeting metabolism can change the course of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Craft.

			&lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don't advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-may-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic"&gt;A Type of Fiber May Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the guidelines say help (and don't help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg" alt="kiwi fruit halved" class="wp-image-178895 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers recommend eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation.

However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; a day for at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this just isn't realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet – where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn't help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know it's not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267617/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study has revealed that gluten sensitivity, which affects approximately 10% of the global population, is not actually about gluten but part of the way the gut and brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to set a new benchmark for how gluten sensitivity is defined, diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research review, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673625015338" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, examined current published evidence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) to better understand this highly prevalent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with NCGS experience symptoms after consuming gluten but do not have celiac disease, an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten. Common symptoms include bloating, gut pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, University of Melbourne Associate Professor Jessica Biesiekierski, said the findings overturn long-held assumptions about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten+sensitivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to popular belief, most people with NCGS aren't reacting to gluten," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that symptoms are more often triggered by fermentable carbohydrates, commonly known as FODMAPs, by other wheat components or by people's expectations and prior experiences with food."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest combined analysis, only a few tightly controlled trials found any real gluten reaction. Overall, people's responses were no different from when they were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Across recent studies, people with IBS who believe they're gluten-sensitive react similarly to gluten, wheat, and placebo. This suggests that how people anticipate and interpret gut sensations can strongly influence their symptoms," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Taken together, this redefines NCGS as part of the gut–brain interaction spectrum, closer to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, rather than a distinct gluten disorder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team—from Australia, The Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom—say the findings have major implications for people self-managing gut symptoms, for clinicians prescribing restrictive diets, and for policymakers shaping public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Millions of people around the world avoid gluten believing it harms their gut, often after experiencing real symptoms that range from mild discomfort to severe distress. Improving our scientific and clinical understanding of a condition affecting up to 15% of the global population is incredibly important," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, Director of the Snow Centre for Immune Health and a gastroenterologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the updated scientific knowledge could help clinicians provide more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment for patients who present with NCGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Distinguishing NCGS from related gut conditions is essential for clinicians to offer accurate diagnosis and individualized care, as well as treating underlying drivers," Professor Tye-Din said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review supports a more personalized, evidence-based approach to gut health and avoids unnecessary dietary restriction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Biesiekierski added that effective care for people with NCGS should combine dietary modifications with psychological support, while ensuring nutritional adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We would like to see public health messaging shift away from the narrative that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten&lt;/a&gt; is inherently harmful, as this research shows that this often isn't the case," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings additionally call for better diagnostic tools, more rigorous clinical pathways and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/research+funding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research funding&lt;/a&gt; in this field, as well as improved public education and food labeling."&lt;/p&gt;

Many people turn to tried-and-true medications, like minoxidil, the active ingredient in products like Rogaine. Despite a recent connection to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a65130958/are-hair-loss-supplements-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain health risks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain health risks&lt;/a&gt;, many of these solutions are relatively inexpensive and available over-the-counter—a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are exploring a way to make minoxidil more effective for hair loss—and it involves stevia. You’re probably familiar with stevia as a sweetener, and this hair loss hack actually repurposes it. It specifically uses the sweetener stevioside, which is derived from the stevia plant, to help stimulate hair growth. The research on this is still in its infancy, and this particular study was done on mice, not humans. But the findings are impressive enough that they’re already getting plenty of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital; &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the link between stevia and hair growth? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For the study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;For the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers combined stevioside with microneedle patches, which use tiny microneedles to help deliver an active ingredient—in this case, minoxidil—into the skin. The researchers tested this in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose their hair and discovered that more of the minoxidil made it into the skin and more hair grew back in the mice that used the patches with stevioside compared to those that just received minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the stevioside patches caused the mice to regrow hair across 67.5 percent of the treatment area with hair after 35 days. Mice with different treatment options didn’t see as big of an impact, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might stevia help with hair growth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, but the researchers have a theory: Stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve better in water and, in theory, that can help more minoxidil get under the skin and into the hair follicles to push for more growth. In essence, the stevioside “acts as a natural absorption enhancer,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Minoxidil has limited skin permeability, which restricts its effectiveness in traditional applications,” he continues. But minoxidil in dissolving microneedles that are enhanced with something like stevioside can bypass your skin’s resistance to support more minoxidil penetration and, hopefully, create more of an impact, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s important to point out that more research is needed. “I do microneedling in combination with minoxidil to improve efficacy in my practice,” says &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics. “But we need controlled trials for the efficacy with adding stevioside and also the safety. We don’t know what the potential side effects could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't put stevia directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have stevia and minoxidil at home, it’s tempting to want to DIY. But Dr. Goldenberg says that’s unlikely to help. “Without the microneedling, applying stevia onto your scalp won't help much,” he says. “Minoxidil would still have the same absorption issue as using it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to see a dermatologist if you’re dealing with hair loss, Rodney says. “Minoxidil is very useful for some types of hair loss and it’s something you can use at home while you wait to get into the dermatologist’s office,” she says. “But there are many different types of hair loss with different causes and treatments. Depending on the cause of your hair loss, minoxidil may not be the specific or only answer.” Some stand-by treatments dermatologists consistently recommend are here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2% Minoxidil Topical Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This solution contains 2% minoxidil, the only FDA-approved topical ingredient to deal with hair loss.

    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt; journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area. The meats most commonly found to test positive for E. coli were turkey and chicken, followed by pork and beef, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/uti/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. They disproportionately affect female and elder patients, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem," Lance B. Price, senior study author and professor at the George Washington University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102657" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the reasons for the strong correlation between poverty rate and foodborne UTIs are unclear, the authors say possible factors include inadequate food safety regulations, poor retail conditions and improper food handling and hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added these findings show why there should be more investments, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code," Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more strict measures are put in place by meat producers and regulatory agencies, the authors of the study advise consumers exercise caution when handling raw meat to prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Preventive steps, such as thorough handwashing, avoiding cross-contamination, and ensuring proper cooking of meat products, are essential to reducing exposure," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

In one of the largest studies to date, MRI data from 40,000 adults revealed that impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow predicts dementia risk years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure can damage this system, worsening toxin buildup in the brain. Improving sleep quality and managing blood pressure could help keep this system functioning and lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Clearance Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Impaired glymphatic system function predicted dementia risk in 40,000 adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure and other vascular risk factors disrupted brain waste flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep and blood pressure control may protect glymphatic function and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could underlie many cases of dementia and help explain why poor sleep patterns and cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at the University of Cambridge found that impaired movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – the clear liquid that cushions and cleans the brain – predicted risk of dementia later in life among 40,000 adults recruited to the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113529"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings are published today in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the healthy brain, the so-called glymphatic system serves to clear out toxins and waste materials, keeping the brain healthy. Only discovered as recently as 2012, this system functions by flushing CSF through the brain along tiny channels around blood vessels known as perivascular spaces. It collects waste then drains out of the brain, helping keep it clean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system is thought to be important in protecting against many of the common forms of dementia, which are often characterised by the build-up of toxic substances in the brain – for example, Alzheimer’s disease sees amyloid ‘plaques’ and tau ‘tangles accumulate in brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of dementia is vascular dementia, caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. The most common cause of this type of dementia is cerebral small vessel disease, which affects the small blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the impact of cerebral small vessel disease is even greater because it also interacts with other dementias making them worse; for example, a study of nuns in the US found that among those nuns whose brains showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease post mortem, only around a half exhibited symptoms of dementia – but this increased to around nine in 10 if they also had cerebral small vessel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hugh Markus and colleagues at the University of Cambridge wanted to see whether cerebral small vessel disease and other cardiovascular risk factors damage the glymphatic system – and whether this in turn increases the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it has only been possible to study glymphatic function in mice, but recent advances in MRI scanning have made it possible to study it indirectly in humans. Even so, it was only possible to do this practically in relatively small numbers, but Yutong Chen, while a medical student at the University of Cambridge, developed machine learning algorithms capable of assessing glymphatic functions from MRI scans at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team applied the algorithm to MRI scans taken from around 40,000 adults in UK Biobank. They found three biomarkers – biological signatures – associated with impaired glymphatic function assessed at baseline, predicted the risk of dementia occurring over the subsequent decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these was DTI-ALPS, a measure of the diffusion of water molecules along the perivascular spaces. Another was the size of the choroid plexus, where the CSF is produced. The third measure reflected the flow velocity of CSF into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yutong Chen, from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Cambridge, said: “Although we have to be cautious about indirect markers, our work provides good evidence in a very large cohort that disruption of the glymphatic system plays a role in dementia. This is exciting because it allows to ask: how can we improve this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that several cardiovascular risk factors impaired glymphatic function – and hence increased dementia risk, and that this was partly via causing cerebral small vessel disease, which is visible in the MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Hui Hong, now a radiologist at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, said: “We already have evidence that small vessel disease in the brain accelerates diseases like Alzheimer’s, and now we have a likely explanation why. Disruption to the glymphatic system is likely to impair our ability to clear the brain of the amyloid and tau that causes Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests possible approaches for reducing dementia risk. One is to look at strategies for improving glymphatic function. Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Alternatively, there may be existing medicines that could be repurposed, or new ones that could be developed, to improve glymphatic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible approach is to treat vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure. This is supported by recent studies: the SPRINT MIND trial, for example, showed that intensive blood pressure control (maintaining a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg) led to a 20% reduction in cognitive decline or dementia compared to participants in the standard treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Markus, who leads the Stroke Research Group at the University of Cambridge and is a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, said: “We already know the importance of cardiovascular risk factors when it comes to dementia, and our findings further emphasise this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At least a quarter of all dementia risk is accounted for by common risk factors like blood pressure and smoking. If these impair glymphatic function, then we can intervene. Treating high blood pressure or encouraging people to stop smoking would be an achievable way to helping the glymphatic system work better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, said:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“This study offers us a fascinating glimpse into how problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could be quietly increasing the chances of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By improving our understanding of the glymphatic system, this study opens exciting new avenues for research to treat and prevent dementia. It also emphasises the importance of managing known cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, for reducing dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation, with additional support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239834973"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is the glymphatic system and why is it important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The glymphatic system is the brain’s cleaning network that flushes out toxins and waste through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Disruption of this system can lead to toxin buildup, potentially contributing to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239844481"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How do cardiovascular factors affect dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: High blood pressure and small vessel disease impair glymphatic flow, reducing the brain’s ability to remove waste such as amyloid and tau proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239860807"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can improving sleep or lowering blood pressure reduce dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes. The study suggests that deep, regular sleep and treating vascular risk factors may enhance waste clearance in the brain, offering practical ways to protect against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dementia and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cdaebfaca4aae3afbfa4a8bfa1a8b48daca9a0a4a3e3aeaca0e3acaee3b8a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MRI markers of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics predict dementia and mediate the impact of cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Hugh Markus et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI markers of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics predict dementia and mediate the impact of cardiovascular risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70699-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics may contribute to dementia, but human evidence is limited.

We assessed cardiovascular risk factors and their associations with CSF dynamics and dementia based on general practitioner, mortality, and hospital records. Mediation analysis evaluated CSF dysfunction in cardiovascular risk–dementia relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70699-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower DTI-ALPS, lower BOLD-CSF coupling, and higher CP volume predicted dementia, but PVS volume did not.

The writer is not in a position to give us answers to any questions, and it’s not really their place to say, “Hey, wife, we haven’t had sex in two weeks. And now randomly I’m asking, why were you douching?” But please, don’t douche.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jat6z001i3b79170rgxka@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems like one of the most straightforward, unhealthy products of capitalism made under the guise of being for women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jav2p001s3b79b90vdhxq@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; In very rare circumstances, there might be a short-term, specific medical use for it. But the douche as a cleanliness product, just for the sake of it, is not good for you. I cannot walk past the word douche without a public service announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re supposed to do that with clean water, and that’s strictly for the purpose of making one’s asshole not shitty during anal sex. So that’s a different kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jayro002c3b796mtsegmc@published"&gt;It’s funny that you bring it up, because my question after reading this was, what’s so traumatic about douching? What if this guy is super knowledgeable about women’s health, and it’s the very fact that she’s doing this? He can’t believe she would do that to her body.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it’s more likely that he is grossed out by the fact of her having a body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb21n002w3b79cwkdjobh@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, it seems like that would be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

And Jenée told her to look at people with bodies similar to yours being people, doing things everybody does, until that feels normalized. I think that might be useful here. Read some subreddits related to women’s health. Just walk right up to the thing that you never really had to realize before, and kind of rub your own face in it a little bit. Hear about some of the gross stuff. Actually, that might completely backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that, for whatever reason, she thought her vagina was not up to snuff in terms of freshness, and somehow, this is going to send him into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve never heard of anyone losing their capacity to see a woman as erotic because of douching, but I think that’s only because most people our age got told really early on, “Do not douche.” But I’ve had male partners who didn’t want to wait until my period was over to have sex, but had to do it with the lights off and the windows open because if they were visually or olfactorily confronted with the reality that there is menstrual fluid, which has a coppery smell. They would be squicked out and disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s nothing arousing about it, but it seems to be the same thing as for me when I saw a male partner shave their face the first few times. There’s that curiosity. The way we teach sex education, even in the areas where people get relatively good sex education, leaves young men severely in the dark about how women’s bodies operate. And I do leave space for the fact that giving birth is pretty traumatic for everyone. So I have a lot of empathy for the men who watch their wife give birth and then are like, “I’ve got a lot to work through.” But these everyday experiences are different.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of people who have that reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

When you’re ovulating, the completely healthy fluids coming out of your vulva are sometimes milky or cloudy. Menstrual blood, it’s a thing, it smells like copper, it’s part of having a body. Tampons, they go in, they come out, and they sit in the trash. I mean, it’s aggressive to leave a bloody menstrual cup sitting on the side of the sink where everyone’s toothbrushes are. I can understand how that’s a lot for someone. A tampon in the trash can, that’s another story.&lt;br&gt;It shouldn’t be on the woman to have to manage all of these shocked and grossed-out feelings. It’s like, “I’m sorry. I’m basically an animal with very little body hair.” You’ve got to come to terms with that if you want to have sex with women, marry women, and live with women.&lt;/p&gt;

You just kind of have to allow yourself to process these feelings and to understand them and just go through it. It has been two weeks for this guy who saw this thing that traumatized him for whatever reason, so it’s early.&lt;/p&gt;

So if the problem is that he doesn’t want to tell her, but she keeps asking, you can tell her. She may find it strange, confusing, or offensive, but it is the reason, and this is a thing that is beyond you; you’re not controlling this. You can be honest about it. Maybe then she’ll have suggestions or she’ll be able to kind of hold your hand, even if you don’t quite deserve it, and actually help you through it. Or you’ll be on your own. And you know what? Give it a few more weeks, give it a month, and you’ll get horny one day, and that will probably be enough to overcome this issue. You just might need to metabolize this and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

Stay in that lane. Own that it is. The writer should own that they are having a reaction that is their problem. They want to let their wife know what’s going on. If the wife offers to be supportive, great. But if at any point the writer frames douching as disgusting or any other facet of just living in a body with internal genitalia and reproductive organs, and the wife leaves them, that is the writer’s fault. If it blows back on you because you’re acting like it’s disgusting to be human, then that’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;

The trial demonstrated that this method of ventilation is safe and “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study published on Monday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enteral ventilation is not meant to replace mechanical ventilators or ECMO, but rather to serve as a complementary oxygenation route,” said Takanori Takebe, &lt;a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/t/takanori-takebe?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an expert in organoid medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with appointments at both Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Osaka, in an email to 404 Media. The technique proves a backdoor “to provide partial oxygen support while allowing the lungs to rest,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while this method is safe for humans, it hasn’t been experimentally shown to work on patients experiencing respiratory distress yet. If future trials show that enteral ventilation is also effective, it could potentially help newborns and premature infants who are struggling to establish lung function after birth, aid patients with severe respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or be applied in other situations in which temporary oxygen supplementation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In such cases, intestinal oxygen delivery could serve as a ‘bridge’ therapy until normal respiration or full ventilatory support can be established,” Takebe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 996w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;A figure outlining the first enteral ventilation trial in humans.

This initial trial in humans involved 27 healthy male volunteers, who received a liquid called perfluorodecalin through their rectums in an enema-like process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the trial was only intended to determine the safety of the procedure, rather than probe its efficacy in humans, the perfluorodecalin was not oxygenated and none of the volunteers were experiencing any respiratory distress during the course of the study.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results aligned closely with what we had anticipated from our preclinical data,” Takebe said. “We found that intrarectal administration of perfluorodecalin up to 1,000 mL was safe and well tolerated, with only mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next phase will involve testing ‘oxygenated’ perfluorodecalin (O₂-PFD) in patients with hypoxemia to evaluate actual oxygen transfer efficacy,” he added. “We are currently planning a Phase II trial in collaboration with clinical partners in Japan and the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takebe and his colleagues were inspired to develop this roundabout route by aquatic species, such as loaches, which absorb oxygen through their intestines to survive in low-oxygen environments. While the idea of rectally administering perfluorodecalin is relatively new, the use of oxygenated liquid for ventilation dates back decades. It even shows up in James Cameron’s 1989 thriller &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, which includes a real scene of a rat breathing in a tank of liquid perfluorocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique may prove to be an effective means to alleviate respiratory distress in humans, but it’s also inspired its fair share of jokes because, well, it is about butt breath, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, for instance, Takebe’s team &lt;a href="https://www.tmd.ac.jp/english/news/20240916032859/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;received the Ig Nobel Prize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a satirical award that honors “achievements so surprising that they make people laugh, then think,” according to its website. Fellow Ig Nobel awardees include a team that &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/tiny-matters/the-ig-nobel-prize-levitating-frogs-constipated-scorpions-and-other-science-that-makes-you-laugh-then-think.html?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;levitated a frog in midair&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and another that investigated why&lt;a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/news/11-hilariously-bizarre-winners-of-the-ig-nobel-prize?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt; pregnant women aren’t constantly tipping over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving the Ig Nobel Prize was both humorous and humbling,” Takebe said. “It was a reminder that truly unconventional ideas often begin at the boundary between curiosity and skepticism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the prize is lighthearted in tone, I do believe it serves a serious purpose, encouraging the public to stay curious and to appreciate how even seemingly odd scientific questions can lead to meaningful innovations,” he concluded. “What began as a playful concept is now moving closer to a viable medical technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"&gt;&lt;p class="kg-callout-emoji"&gt;🌘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/signup/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to 404 Media to get &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/tag/the-abstract/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong class="italic"&gt;The Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) as the enzyme that releases energy stored in our fat. Yet patients born without this protein do not become obese: on the contrary, they lose their adipose tissue, developing lipodystrophy with severe metabolic complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team from the Institute of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases (I2MC, Inserm/Université de Toulouse) has just solved this puzzle by discovering that HSL plays a second, unsuspected role in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nucleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleus&lt;/a&gt; of fat cells. The study is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00433-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fat cells, called adipocytes, do more than just store extra weight. They play a key role in managing the body's energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipocytes accumulate fat in the form of lipid droplets that the body can use when needed—for example, during fasting periods between meals. To do this, the body uses the HSL protein like a kind of switch. When energy is lacking, HSL is activated by hormones such as adrenaline and releases fat to fuel various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of HSL, one might assume that the energy tap is shut off and that fat would inevitably accumulate. Paradoxically, however, studies in mice and in patients with mutations in the HSL gene show that this does not lead to obesity with excess fat. Quite the opposite happens: the absence of this protein causes a reduction in fat mass, a pathological condition known as lipodystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity and lipodystrophy, though seemingly opposite, share a common point: in both cases, adipocytes malfunction, leading to similar metabolic and cardiovascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To understand this peculiarity, the research team led by Dominique Langin, professor at the University of Toulouse within the I2MC, noticed that HSL was located in an unexpected area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adipocytes, the protein is known to be on the surface of lipid droplets, where it acts as an enzyme breaking down fat. But the study reveals that it is also present in the nucleus of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the nucleus of adipocytes, HSL is able to associate with many other proteins and take part in a program that maintains an optimal amount of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adipose+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; and keeps adipocytes 'healthy,'" explains Jérémy Dufau, co-author of the study, who defended his doctoral thesis on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study shows that the amount of HSL in the nucleus is finely regulated. Adrenaline, which activates the enzyme on the lipid droplet, also promotes its exit from the nucleus. This is what happens during fasting. In a pathological context, the amount of nuclear HSL is increased in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HSL has been known since the 1960s as a fat-mobilizing enzyme. But we now know that it also plays an essential role in the nucleus of adipocytes, where it helps maintain healthy adipose tissue," concludes Langin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new role explains the lipodystrophy observed in patients lacking HSL and opens avenues for a better understanding of metabolic diseases such as obesity and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a timely moment. Overweight and obesity affect one in two adults in France. Worldwide, two and a half billion people are affected. Obesity increases the risk of many diseases, including diabetes and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and impairs quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued research is essential to improve prevention and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patient care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	This is the first confirmed case of locally acquired terrestrial rabies in a feral cat and the 12th case in wildlife in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt; As News 12 has reported 11 raccoons tested positive for the virus this year.

	Rabies is a viral disease transmitted from infected mammals to humans. Left untreated, it can lead to death. 

	Early symptoms include irritability, headache, fever, and sometimes itching at the site of exposure. Within days, the disease progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, delirium, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials are working with the USDA, to conduct a Racoon Rabies Control Program which comprises enhanced surveillance of the raccoon population to identify areas where the disease may be present.

	They're also distributing oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits in the Towns of Babylon, Huntington, Smithtown, and Islip to prevent the spread of rabies.

	The baits contain a vaccine that, when consumed by a raccoon, will vaccinate the animal against the rabies virus. The goal of the Racoon Rabies Control Program is containment and elimination of terrestrial rabies in local wild animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:33:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPbG91T0RQR09ZTTZFWTBOVXFRSFBYQnpzYXc3ZlRRS3hybTZIeV9Hc2FlZ0NHa1BWb244Rjl5Z2N3ZHgwbUtHLS1veVd5MTI2UU4wSlBDcDA4LTYyLVpqNHZpeTRGOHphbE0tTHFHR0FWS3B4TXhEM1ozWXQyUC1VcDFFa0hOdTlkTEhHMA</guid></item><item><title>“超级老人”的大脑似乎并不老化，现在科学家说他们知道原因- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/superagers-have-brains-that-dont-seem-to-age-now-scientists-say-they-know-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a quarter of a century, researchers have been tracking a rare group of older adults who defy expectations about aging. These “SuperAgers,” all aged 80 or older, seem to have brains that age more slowly while routinely scoring very high on memory tests – as well as people three decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their performance upends the notion that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; is an unavoidable consequence of growing old – and it’s giving scientists a roadmap to protect brain health deep into later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-superagers-brains"&gt;Studying SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SuperAging program began in the late 1990s, when neurologist M. Marsel Mesulam coined the term and launched an effort to find out what sets these individuals apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, 290 SuperAgers have enrolled, and 77 have donated their brains for study after death. The research blends years of cognitive testing, personality assessments, and high-resolution imaging with painstaking postmortem analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, researchers noticed a common thread among the living participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are unusually social and outgoing, reporting rich interpersonal networks and frequent engagement with others. But the most startling insights have come from the tissue under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences, and neurology at &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-protects-superagers-brains"&gt;What protects SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathology tells a nuanced story. Some SuperAger brains show very little buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles the proteins that hallmark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-attacks-the-brain-in-two-separate-phases/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Others carry these lesions but appear unfazed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “do nothing” is key. In typical aging, higher levels of amyloid and tau correlate with cortical thinning and memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SuperAgers, either the proteins are absent, or the brain’s networks seem to withstand their presence without measurable loss in function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This split – resistance versus resilience – could guide both preventive strategies and future treatments for Alzheimer’s and related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-that-stays-decades-younger"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Memory that stays decades younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, SuperAgers clear a high bar. On a standard delayed word recall test, they score nine or better out of 15, a performance that mirrors average results for people in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference isn’t a fleeting testing trick; it persists year after year in longitudinal follow-up. That consistency allows scientists to distinguish a single lucky test day from a truly exceptional memory profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stronger-cortex-sharper-memory"&gt;Stronger cortex, sharper memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging adds another layer. Unlike typical older adults, SuperAgers do not show the widespread thinning of the cerebral cortex that comes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some regions they look even more robust than younger people. The anterior cingulate cortex – central to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/optimal-decision-making-is-a-balance-of-experience-and-knowledge/"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and emotional control – often appears thicker in SuperAgers than in adults decades their junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern hints at why their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/words-like-this-and-that-direct-attention-across-languages/"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and executive function remain so strong and may contribute directly to memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cells-of-connection-and-strength"&gt;Cells of connection and strength&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the microscope, two cellular details stand out. First, SuperAgers have more von Economo neurons – large, fast-signaling cells linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/social-curiosity-starts-young-and-helps-us-survive/"&gt;social behavior&lt;/a&gt; and intuition – than typically aging peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they show larger neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a hub for memory processing that’s among the first brain regions to falter in Alzheimer’s. Both traits suggest a structural and cellular foundation for the resilience seen at the systems level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social theme that emerges in personality measures may not be incidental. More &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; could be part of the biological substrate underpinning the sociability many SuperAgers report, a behavioral pattern long associated with better cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-memory-before-decline"&gt;Protecting memory before decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and her colleagues see these findings as more than a scientific curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile,” she said. “This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers can mimic the protective features of SuperAger brains – or train the brain to resist or withstand pathology – clinical practice could shift from chasing symptoms to preserving function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may mean new pharmaceuticals aimed at bolstering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/infant-brains-are-more-organized-and-adaptable-than-we-thought/"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle interventions that amplify the brain’s natural “reserve,” or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reframes traditional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s research&lt;/a&gt;: rather than asking only how to remove amyloid or tau, scientists can also ask how to make the brain less vulnerable to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-lasting-legacy"&gt;SuperAgers’ lasting legacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what we know comes from an extraordinary commitment by participants. SuperAgers are evaluated annually, and many choose to donate their brains for postmortem analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said neuropsychologist Tamar Gefen, a co-author on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-sharp-brains-future-health"&gt;SuperAgers, sharp brains, future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now probing why some brains resist pathology while others absorb it without consequence. Are there genetic signatures that predict resilience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do lifelong habits – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/older-adults-value-social-connection-over-their-own-health/"&gt;social engagement&lt;/a&gt;, aerobic fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive challenge – interact with biology to produce the SuperAger profile? And can targeted interventions in midlife shift the brain toward the same protective patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 25 years, one message is already clear: cognitive decline isn’t a foregone conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subset of older adults retains memory performance on par with people decades younger, supported by unusual structural, cellular, and pathological profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SuperAgers show that the aging brain can be both tough and flexible – and that translating their biology into prevention could help more of us keep our minds keen well into our 80s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:09:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNakVBY3dDZHdUMVFXalIyaDRtT0dYTHZSNEpOTmhjTERVbXA2aWNEblEwTU0tN25RMDh0aGhQY255WTByZW9Oc0ExM09XaTREcjc3S3Rna0o5UzV4eFdQUkJJRkRiT1dCbWtqbVRDbGxkckhxWVJIUlRzTEZ1NFlhMkZfc3NsSENlNDVHOW5HSVo4allhWVBRVGFmYVhvcXFJMVk2ZHpaR20</guid></item><item><title>您的脖子揭示了您的健康状况-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/what-your-neck-reveals-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;More serious persistent pain can indicate disc herniation, compression of the spinal cord, spinal infection, spinal tumours and infections such as meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Swelling in the neck, accompanied by difficulty swallowing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also linked to the thyroid, this could indicate an iodine deficiency. This condition was once so common among people living in parts of Derbyshire, where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/healthy-supplements-really/"&gt;iodine&lt;/a&gt; in diets was scarce, that it became known as Derbyshire neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Derbyshire neck is now rare in the UK, thanks to more varied diets and imported foods rich in iodine such as dairy and seafood, iodine deficiency is a growing concern in the UK, particularly among vulnerable groups like pregnant women, women of childbearing age and girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While severe deficiency is rare, studies have shown that mild to moderate deficiency is prevalent as a result of changing dietary habits, such as drinking less milk and a rise in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Nodes or lumps in the side of the neck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swollen glands in the neck are usually a sign the body is fighting an infection. Swollen glands can be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, a sore throat, a rough rash, scabs and sores, severe muscle aches, nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Swollen glands could suggest sepsis in the mouth or throat, or tonsillitis.” explains Dr Dilkes. “Tongue &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/throat-cancer-guide-larynx-pharynx-signs-symptoms/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Bulging vein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bulging, ropey vein in the neck can be a sign of increased pressure in the venous system, and while sometimes harmless, it can also indicate an underlying heart or circulatory problem, such as kidney or liver disease, right-sided heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jugular veins drain blood from the head and neck back to the heart and a bulging jugular vein can indicate that the right side of the heart isn’t pumping efficiently. If this is the case, blood can back-up into these veins, making them appear swollen or pulsating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dilkes explains: “In medical exams, clinicians use the height of the jugular vein as a visible gauge of central venous pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Throbbing lump&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often called a pulsatile mass, a new or enlarged throbbing &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/laryngeal-larynx-cancer-a-comprehensive-guide/"&gt;lump&lt;/a&gt; in the neck that beats in time with your pulse, or is on one side only, could mean an artery has weakened, ballooned or developed an abnormal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, a weak, a ballooned area that expands with each heartbeat could rupture (causing an aneurysm) or form a blood clot that travels to the brain, increasing the risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump could also be a carotid body tumour (paraganglioma), which is a benign growth that develops on the small cluster of nerve tissue next to the carotid artery, a major blood vessel located on the side of the neck. Though usually not life-threatening, it often needs surgery or monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other causes could be trauma-related swelling, an enlarged thyroid artery or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that can result in death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/a&gt;, dementia is not a specific disease. Rather, it's an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that is severe enough to interfere with daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's caused by damage to brain cells, which affects a person's ability to think, remember, and communicate. While &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-throws-away-video-tapes-ex-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; loss is the most well-known symptom, dementia also impacts focus, reasoning, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stage, a person can still be very independent, but may experience noticeable memory lapses. The middle stage is typically the longest, and this is where many of the unfiltered and surreal moments shared in this list can occur. As the disease progresses, social filters can fade, and the part of the brain that says "you probably shouldn't say that out loud" isn't working as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533597"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533597" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2148597169-68f8832a74f7d__700.jpg" alt="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home." title="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;When my grandma had dementia she offered to steal a rug for me. “You like this rug?

The curious part is, the comment refers to events from 1865, a time the patient could not possibly have been alive. So, if it’s not a memory, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Bradley Bursack, an elder care consultant, explains that this is called &lt;a href="https://www.agingcare.com/articles/how-to-handle-alzheimers-disease-lying-144204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;confabulation&lt;/a&gt;, a common symptom in mid-to-late-stage dementia. The brain, struggling with significant memory gaps, will essentially create a plausible, though often historically or personally inaccurate, story to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person experiencing confabulation is not lying; they genuinely believe these created memories are true. Their brain's filing system is damaged, so it grabs bits and pieces of information from books, movies, or &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;historical events&lt;/a&gt; learned long ago and misapplies them to the present reality, leading to these deeply strange and often hilarious moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533681"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533681" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149232318-68f88749c413a__700.jpg" alt="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories." title="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My dementia patient was a farmer.

However, Dr. Andrew E. Budson &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/managing-your-memory/202405/dont-fight-false-memories-in-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that this is often the worst possible approach when dealing with dementia. He says that directly fighting or arguing with a false memory is not only ineffective but can be actively harmful, leading to increased distress for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, Dr. Budson advises, is to remember that the person genuinely believes their false reality. Arguing with them is like arguing with you about what you had for breakfast; it feels like a personal attack. Instead of correcting, the recommended approach is to "go with the flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge their reality, validate the emotion behind it, and then gently redirect the conversation. The goal is not to win a factual debate but to maintain a positive, trusting connection and ensure your loved one feels safe and understood, even if their reality doesn't match our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533599"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533599" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2150494655-68f8836a56101__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes." title="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had one that wanted to teach me how to read.

Another noted that deep-seated prejudices, like racism, simply vanished, as if the part of the brain that held on to that learned negativity had been wiped clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it can be painful, not recognizing a child can sometimes lead to a sweet new beginning, like the parent who gossips about their kids, to their kids, as if they were new best friends instead!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533609"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533609" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/19092-68f89a650113f__700.jpg" alt="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care." title="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandfather had dementia and told my mom he took a trip to China so she asked the nurse about it. the specialist saw him that day and the dr was Chinese.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTA3ODM3MTU1MjAxOTIzMQ" target="_blank"&gt; Mamabear &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/portrait-asian-doctor-white-coat-with-stethoscope-standing-office-smiling-camera_52355423.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank"&gt; sodawhiskey &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533612"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533612" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149370432-68f886b3f2f75__700.jpg" alt="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment." title="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandpa had dementia and he told someone " you dont sweat that much for a fat person " and fully thought it was a compliment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTE0MDM0OTQwMTc2MDU0Mg" target="_blank"&gt; Kris &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/old-patient-suffering-from-parkinson_25177981.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=3&amp;amp;uuid=c5cec629-5811-4245-9dfa-cd1d1fe4dd61&amp;amp;query=grandpa+dementia+patient" target="_blank"&gt; freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-10/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a caregiver for someone with dementia is one of the most emotionally and physically demanding roles anyone can undertake. The daily challenges can be immense, which is why finding moments of light is not just a bonus; it's a crucial survival strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As caregiving experts at Onyx Home Care &lt;a href="https://onyxhomecare.com/how-to-stay-positive-and-find-joy-in-dementia-caregiving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt;, it is essential for caregivers to consciously look for opportunities to find joy and stay positive, both for their own well-being and for the person they are caring for. The stories shared in this list are a perfect example of this principle in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to embrace the surreal humor of a situation rather than fight it, these caregivers are finding a way to connect with their loved ones in the present moment. These flashes of laughter don't erase the heartbreak of the condition, but they are a powerful reminder of the enduring love that shines through, even in the most difficult of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any hilarious anecdotes to share from your experiences with dementia?

&lt;p&gt;The bat was discovered around 2 p.m. Oct. 16 on the west side of the 500 block of South Main Street, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials urged anyone who touched the bat or saw someone else handle it to call the agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division at 714-834-8180, which operates 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners whose animals may have had contact with the bat should contact their veterinarian, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-fbvgdraj" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_fbvgdraj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal,” the agency said in a statement, adding that preventive treatment is safe and effective if administered promptly after possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency and OC Animal Care offered the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Avoid contact with wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Vaccinate cats and dogs against rabies&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Do not sleep with unscreened windows or doors open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Contact animal control if bats are found inside a home or building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Do not leave pet food outside where it could attract wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Wash animal bites immediately with soap and water and seek medical care&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Report animal bites to OC Animal Care at 714-935-6848&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals, usually by a bite, though rare cases have occurred through contact with the eyes, mouth or an open wound, officials said. Most U.S. human rabies cases in recent years have come from bats, whose small bites can go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that cysteine can activate an immune signaling process that encourages stem cells to grow new intestinal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enhanced ability to regenerate could help the body heal damage caused by radiation, which is a common side effect of cancer treatments. Although the study was conducted in mice, scientists say that if similar results are seen in humans, cysteine from food or supplements might offer a new way to help the intestine recover faster after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study suggests that if we give these patients a cysteine-rich diet or cysteine supplementation, perhaps we can dampen some of the chemotherapy or radiation-induced injury," says Omer Yilmaz, director of the MIT Stem Cell Initiative, an associate professor of biology at MIT, and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. "The beauty here is we're not using a synthetic molecule; we're exploiting a natural dietary compound."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that specific types of diets, including calorie restriction, can enhance the function of intestinal stem cells. However, this research is the first to pinpoint a single nutrient that directly boosts the gut's regenerative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz is the senior author of the study, which was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The paper's lead author is Koch Institute postdoctoral researcher Fangtao Chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet and Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that diet plays a major role in health. High-fat diets can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, while low-calorie diets have been linked to longer lifespans in many species. Yilmaz's lab has long studied how different dietary patterns influence stem cell regeneration and has previously shown that both high-fat diets and short-term fasting can boost stem cell activity in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that macro diets such as high-sugar diets, high-fat diets, and low-calorie diets have a clear impact on health. But at the granular level, we know much less about how individual nutrients impact stem cell fate decisions, as well as tissue function and overall tissue health," Yilmaz says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest work, the MIT team fed mice diets high in one of 20 amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. They then analyzed how each amino acid affected stem cell growth in the intestine. Cysteine produced the strongest impact, greatly increasing both stem cells and progenitor cells (immature cells that develop into adult intestinal cells).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed that cysteine sets off a chain reaction that activates immune cells known as CD8 T cells. When intestinal cells absorb cysteine from food, they convert it into CoA, a cofactor that moves into the mucosal lining of the intestine. There, CD8 T cells take up CoA, which triggers them to multiply and release a signaling molecule called IL-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-22 plays a key role in regulating intestinal stem cell regeneration, but until now, scientists did not know that CD8 T cells could produce it. Once activated, these IL-22-releasing T cells help protect and repair the intestinal lining whenever it is injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's really exciting here is that feeding mice a cysteine-rich diet leads to the expansion of an immune cell population that we typically don't associate with IL-22 production and the regulation of intestinal stemness," Yilmaz says. "What happens in a cysteine-rich diet is that the pool of cells that make IL-22 increases, particularly the CD8 T-cell fraction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These T cells tend to cluster in the intestinal lining, placing them in the right location to respond quickly to damage. The researchers observed that the activation of CD8 T cells occurred mainly in the small intestine, not elsewhere in the digestive tract, likely because most dietary protein is absorbed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repairing Radiation and Chemotherapy Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice on a cysteine-rich diet showed improved repair of radiation damage to the intestinal lining. In additional, unpublished work, the team found that the same diet helped regeneration after treatment with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy drug commonly used for colon and pancreatic cancers that can also harm intestinal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine occurs naturally in many protein-rich foods, including meat, dairy, legumes, and nuts. The body can also make cysteine by converting another amino acid, methionine, in the liver. However, the cysteine produced internally circulates throughout the body rather than concentrating in the intestine the way dietary cysteine does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With our high-cysteine diet, the gut is the first place that sees a high amount of cysteine," Chi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine has long been known for its antioxidant properties, but this study is the first to show that it also helps intestinal stem cells regenerate. The researchers are now exploring whether cysteine can stimulate regeneration in other tissues as well. One ongoing project is testing whether cysteine can promote hair follicle regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also plan to continue investigating other amino acids that may influence stem cell renewal and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think we're going to uncover multiple new mechanisms for how these amino acids regulate cell fate decisions and gut health in the small intestine and colon," Yilmaz says.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/violinist-plays-surgeons-operate-remove-brain-tumour-n1138436" target="_blank"&gt;violinist played jazz &lt;/a&gt;classics as a tumor was removed from her brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a79b5d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c490b9" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King’s College Hospital said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:03:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQWldRck9weTRDMEtLY0lFNlE1RU52QlpzLUJUN2M3QUtrQ0xKdVZQRkg5bXlMMUlwanVSRndKLXRWVHhHam1MS2JvWk5seG12UERMM1paMjRJbDNTLVMzWDhkb0NqbnBQS2VlN0ZqeXVJbHR6OWVvXzlqZ3E2TGF5dUNoN19QbEE1NWoyc3VTSHZFQnJYdkpxcmF5V21RdlJLbmpNeFhrdks5YThjS3NxLUc1aE9hSG_SAVZBVV95cUxOQlNnODZwdmxmeU1uS3RyQUJlWFpaOU0xdG5OWGk5eDYyakh3djdqMC1lVWdHWlBJUVA2cmdmcEJDRHVVMHktLTJha0lKakwtMDJqQmU5dw</guid></item><item><title>狗可能是减缓人类衰老的关键- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-may-hold-the-key-to-slow-aging-in-humans/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing old is not just about time. It is chemistry, biology, and chance working together in every cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have searched for measurable signs in the body that tell how well life is aging. These signs, called biomarkers, can reveal more than just years – they can whisper how healthy the body truly is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists studying dogs have found molecular traces that could help explain aging in both animals and humans. These findings could reshape how researchers study longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking these molecules, scientists may soon measure not only how fast aging happens but also how to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery offers a glimpse into a shared biological story between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-pandemic-changed-dog-behavior-over-3-years/"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, written in the language of chemistry, resilience, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-as-aging-mirrors"&gt;Dogs as aging mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; analyzed blood from almost 800 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dogs live in homes, eat family food, and breathe the same air as their owners. Their shared environments make them powerful models for human biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that about 40 percent of small molecules in the dogs’ blood shifted with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These molecules, known as metabolites, are basically the building blocks of life,” said Daniel Promislow, senior scientist and scientific advisor at the HNRCA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They serve as the raw materials for forming proteins, DNA, and other cellular components, and play a critical role in keeping cells alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery hints that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mapping-disease-patterns-in-dogs-can-reveal-whats-ahead/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; reshapes metabolism deeply. The body does not just slow down – it changes the way its chemistry works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-clues-in-dogs"&gt;Aging clues in dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the thousands of molecules examined, one group stood out. These were post-translationally modified amino acids, or ptmAAs. They form when proteins break apart or when gut bacteria tinker with nutrients during digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that ptmAAs appeared more often in older dogs, no matter the breed or size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These metabolites are created in two ways in the body,” explained Promislow. “The bacteria in our guts can make ptmAAs as we digest our food, or they can show up when proteins break down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery connects aging to how the body manages its proteins. When these molecules accumulate, they might signal slower recycling of proteins or rising wear inside &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/training-service-dogs-slows-aging-and-stress-in-veterans/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt;. Each change reflects a shift in how the body maintains itself over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kidneys-show-aging-impacts"&gt;Kidneys show aging impacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pattern stood out clearly. Dogs with weaker kidneys carried higher levels of these modified amino acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys normally filter protein byproducts out of the blood. When filtration weakens, these chemicals stay behind, building up in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That buildup may reveal how well the body clears its own waste. It also helps explain why some animals seem to age more gently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger kidney function might keep the blood cleaner and the body healthier longer. Because humans share similar biology, the finding may apply to us too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-dogs-over-years"&gt;Tracking dogs over years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study captured a single moment – a comparison between young and old dogs. But aging is a story written slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to follow the same dogs for years to see how these metabolites change. Tracking individual dogs will help reveal whether these molecules predict future &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-owners-ages-and-beliefs-influence-their-pet-food-choices/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, not just describe the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will also explore how gut microbes influence these aging signals. Changes in the gut community can alter metabolism and immune balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain bacteria drive the rise of ptmAAs, targeting those microbes could one day help slow aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-dogs-teach-about-aging"&gt;What dogs teach about aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing results in dogs and humans, scientists hope to find universal signs of aging. Such biomarkers could guide new treatments, showing whether an intervention truly keeps the body younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dog Aging Project’s massive dataset, rich with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle information, makes that possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promislow sees a shared benefit ahead. “We have a tremendous opportunity to understand the causes and consequences of aging and to discover ways to ensure that both species enjoy the healthiest aging trajectory possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs may not live as long as humans, but their lives unfold faster – and in that speed, science can read the script of aging. Every wagging tail and every heartbeat might hold clues to how both species can stay stronger, healthier, and more vibrant for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their shorter lifespans allow scientists to observe decades of biological change within years, revealing how organs adapt, how cells repair damage, and how lifestyle influences longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8ccbe339-cbe1-4cd6-a8be-c11242db49b8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8b05bbf5-d035-4b30-9a95-ff1d53f72d45"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-b12e5732-0b61-49a5-9936-fb4b54f06e7f"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-dcccefa8-a45e-4859-829e-cb01c7743ac3"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:02:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5VV1hFQ2k4aURjYTdZRkdqMnFXM3hiUWtHWFlTT1Y2OU9EaF9aUmlNVUxoOG5rYVJkTVlVTFZ5MnlqVTM1VVFpc1drbURDWUF4dVlvajhuSmhLZU5nbFhHVnBMSUhWVURWeHVGS0w4Q3lqODZJWWE1X1hPM3BYQQ</guid></item><item><title>Chai与咖啡：哪种对能量、消化和心脏健康有益？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/chai-vs-coffee-11832964</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee gives you more energy because it has more caffeine than chai.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chai is gentler on the stomach and might be better if coffee upsets your stomach.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both coffee and chai are good for your heart because they have antioxidants.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chai is a traditional drink from India that's made from boiling black tea (often Assam tea) with milk and sugar. A variation of the drink, called masala chai, includes aromatic spices like ginger, cardamom, cloves, and black pepper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both coffee and chai offer several health benefits when consumed regularly. However, the main difference between these two is the caffeine content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-coffee-has-a-lot-more-caffeine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Coffee Has a Lot More Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the black tea used for chai does provide a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-energy-drinks-11824927" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt;, coffee provides about twice as much caffeine per cup:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80-100 milligrams in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30-50 milligrams in chai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Coffee provides more of an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/snacks-that-boost-your-energy-more-than-a-cup-of-coffee-11760875" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energy boost due to its higher caffeine content&lt;/a&gt;. It can increase alertness, improve physical performance, and sharpen focus," said &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/overviewcoph/faculty/lywright" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, director of nutrition programs and an associate professor at USF College of Public Health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She said this makes coffee a good choice for people who tolerate caffeine well and are looking for a stronger mental and physical boost, especially in the morning or before workouts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some, the jolt can lead to jitteriness, anxiety, or even disrupted sleep. Because chai has less caffeine and an amino acid called L-theanine, it tends to provide a gentler energy boost than coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Many drinkers describe it as 'calm energy,'" Wright said. "People who are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-allergy-83178" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, have reflux, or struggle with anxiety may do better with chai."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-chai-might-be-easier-on-your-stomach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Chai Might Be Easier on Your Stomach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result of its bitter compounds, coffee can stimulate digestive processes, said &lt;a href="https://stjudewellnesscenter.org/meet-our-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Wroe, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and the wellness manager at Providence St. Jude Medical Center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But some of its compounds can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-7111848" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;trigger IBS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and be hard on the digestive system, she added. For those with sensitive stomachs, the high caffeine content can also lead to digestive issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chai, on the other hand, is easier on the stomach because of its low caffeine content. If you get masala chai, which typically contains ginger, it can soothe the stomach, aid digestion, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ginger-for-nausea-8740699" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relieve nausea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wroe explained that coffee and chai both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contain polyphenols and antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, which are good for the immune and cardiovascular systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you tolerate caffeine well enough, no rule says you must choose one drink over another. In fact, many people enjoy both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some choose coffee to start the day and drink chai in the afternoon when they want something warm and flavorful without the same caffeine levels," Wright said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If caffeine causes you anxiety, upsets your stomach, or disrupts your sleep, she said you may want to opt for chai or even decaffeinated coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's important to note that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-caffeine-11802174" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FDA’s general guideline on caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is no more than 400 milligrams per day, which is about four 8-ounce cups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Whether choosing coffee or chai, I caution consumers to read labels of pre-made versions and be aware of milk and sugar additions they add themselves," Wroe noted. "High sugar and additives often found in these drinks create inflammatory effects that somewhat cancel the other benefits."&lt;br&gt;

Around 6 million to 8 million cases are recorded in the United States every year, and around &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection" target="_blank"&gt;80% are caused by E. coli bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But the strains responsible for the majority of UTIs are not the ones typically associated with foodborne illnesses, which cause diarrhea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8abcda" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank"&gt;published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal mBio, hints at the prevalence of foodborne UTIs, which were largely unknown to scientists two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf66" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is the latest in a long series of studies that have shown that we’re getting some of our urinary tract infections from food,” said Dr. Martin Blaser, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da3ec2" class="body-graf"&gt;“A study like this allows people to draw inferences, to understand what’s going on,” he added. “If somebody develops a urinary tract infection, they’re now wondering, ‘Well, was it the hamburger I ate three days ago or five days ago?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d102f" class="body-graf"&gt;When E. coli bacteria from food wind up causing a UTI, they first enter the gut after people touch contaminated meat in the cooking process or eat undercooked meat. From there, the bacteria can get into the urethra as a result of poor hygiene or improper wiping in the bathroom, then ascend into the urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25cebe" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the study’s authors, Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, said he was inspired to investigate the link between UTIs and contaminated meat about 15 years ago, when he noticed that most of the chicken and turkey he tested carried the bacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796bfe" class="body-graf"&gt;“For some reason, that was basically being ignored. If it didn’t cause diarrhea, it was being ignored. And so that started me on this path,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad4fc5" class="body-graf"&gt;Price’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381" target="_blank"&gt;previous research estimated, based on modeling, &lt;/a&gt;that foodborne E. coli could account for up to 640,000 UTIs in the United States every year — around 8% of the total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5dc1ce" class="body-graf"&gt;His new findings come from a collaboration with researchers at Kaiser Permanente, who collected more than 2,300 urine samples that were positive for E. coli in Southern California from 2017 to 2021. They also took more than 3,300 samples from meat sold in major grocery stores in the area over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ef358" class="body-graf"&gt;A lab at George Washington University then analyzed the genetic material to determine the origins of people’s infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-431eac" class="body-graf"&gt;“Strains have different DNA signatures, and you can see whether the strains in the animals and the strains in the people match up or not. And they found a number of matches,” Blaser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e2ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Among the meat sampled, contamination rates were highest in chicken and turkey products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02f5e9" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also found that low-income neighborhoods in Southern California had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs than wealthier neighborhoods. Price and his co-authors suggested that grocery stores in those areas might not have proper storage temperatures or that they may keep products out for too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1a809" class="body-graf"&gt;Price said he has seen poorly packaged meat sold in some stores in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d37b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would buy these packages of chicken that were just bloated, just so full of saline that when I put it on the conveyor belt ... it would just be wet,” he said. “And I know what’s in that liquid: It’s bacteria, and often drug-resistant bacteria, that’s spilling onto these conveyor belts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-640c3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Urinary tract infections can cause painful and frequent urination, and if they are left untreated, they can lead to serious or life-threatening complications, so people with suspected UTIs should seek treatment right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbc9d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“The bladder is a major gateway to the bloodstream for E. coli. And when you get these E. coli in your blood, they can kill you,” Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb6add" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors treat UTIs with the same antibiotics regardless of whether the E. coli originated from contaminated meat or another source. (Doctors and patients rarely know the source of an infection, Price said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f74442" class="body-graf"&gt;Although thoroughly cooking meat and poultry can kill bacteria, Price said, the transmission of foodborne E. coli is mostly due to cross-contamination in the kitchen, so it is important to keep raw meat separate from other items and wash your hands thoroughly after you prepare food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aebd09" class="body-graf"&gt;His study also recommends that meat producers and regulatory agencies consider stricter measures to limit E. coli contamination, such as making sure packages are sealed tightly and do not contain excess liquid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcaca2" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Everybody should have leak-proof packaging in the United States,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOaHV4UFI4NkwwR3ZyV2NsSmVZdkYyUTlKOWdIMk42LW9hX1RuUmNob24wOWkwMGJHQThzUDlRXzZhRi1KUDgtLWdVUVRFNTlpX1Z3eVFYa2F6VUF6REZMRFZsVFZJeW1oTWhfcU5SdThUM1pnWWlGSVh5NXZCbDM3Ml9HTlpqNE5pcXJ0MFNoZjdZSTY1YnE2NGxnZlY2RXZDNU8tVlMtVVdjd9IBVkFVX3lxTFBEWGtKajRqaFo4aS04Tndpc0x1aE9DckVnMDQxOTNzbWVoLWhfRzM1YVVkMUlDbXh6T1UxdzdoWWg2UUQyeEcxeW43MGdQXzhuaWVoLXdn</guid></item><item><title>妈妈醉酒女孩的旅行事故揭示了令人震惊的健康诊断并挽救了她的生命： “奇迹” - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/mom-drunken-girls-trip-mishap-123007884.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Butlins in Minehead in the U.K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking she may have broken or bruised her rib during a drunken weekend away with friends, Charlotte Morjaria, 31, headed to the hospital where doctors discovered something more sinister was going on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that moment, it was probably the most scared I've ever been in my life," the mother of one told BBC Wales of her diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria was diagnosed with kidney cancer after medics found a sizable cancerous tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 31-year-old British woman has a drunken weekend away with her two best friends to thank for potentially saving her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Charlotte Morjaria, who lives in Newport in Wales, headed to a Butlin's seaside resort in the town of Minehead in Somerset, England, for a girls' trip, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c864dg1wvplo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC Wales;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the vacation, the trio joined a bachelor party and were playing a game of tag when one of the men picked Morjaria up and lifted her over his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then that she heard something "go pop," but carried on having fun before heading to the hospital the following day once she had returned home to get checked out, thinking she might have broken or bruised a rib, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably a tad too much drinking, albeit we were having a fantastic time before disaster struck — or you could call it a miracle," Morjaria, who was 30 at the time of the injury, told BBC Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at the hospital, the mother of one learned that her ribs were fine, but medics had discovered a "sizeable" cancerous tumor on her kidney, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Titmuss/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/p&gt; Butlins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that moment, it was probably the most scared I've ever been in my life," she said, insisting that she had no idea the tumor — which was 2.5 inches in size — was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said they'd found a sizeable mass on my left kidney," said Morjaria, who almost left the hospital's waiting room several times after having to wait for 22 hours, before her mom and her friend persuaded her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was told the tumor was being treated as cancer, which she couldn't believe, telling the outlet, "The conversation was a strange one, because I thought I was fine. There really weren't very big tell-tale signs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria — who was sent from The Grange Hospital to nearby Royal Gwent Hospital — ended up being diagnosed with stage one of a rare form of kidney cancer: &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-kidney-tumors/translocation-renal-cell-carcinoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TFE3 renal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TFE3 renal cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had surgery to have her kidney removed in August of this year, a day before she turned 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria told BBC Wales, "[My consultant] had only heard of one case, it is rare. They didn't have a lot of information," adding, "Thankfully it hadn't spread ... but they still needed to get it out pretty quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Horwood/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria — who was told in September that she's cancer free, but still has to have regular scans as she's seen as high risk — told the outlet that there were quite a few factors that could have hidden any symptoms of weight loss, chronic fatigue and back pain before her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she had the "normal aches and pains," but just put it down to running around after her "absolutely crazy" son, Sebastian, 2.

People sip it for weight, dab it on skin, and drop it into morning water. A little diluted vinegar now and then might be harmless for many, but used chronically or undiluted and especially when people rely on supplements or poorly made commercial bottles, ACV can cause real harm. Here are six severe side effects specialists see in the clinic and in the literature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tooth enamel erosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACV is highly acidic. Repeated exposure softens and erodes tooth enamel in ways similar to acidic drinks. An 8-week randomised &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297831/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and in-vitro studies show measurable enamel wear and tooth surface changes after regular vinegar ingestion or exposure. Even diluted daily “shots” can accelerate enamel loss over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous drops in potassium (hypokalemia) and bone loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic, large-volume ingestion has been linked to low potassium levels - a condition that can cause muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest in extreme cases. In fact, a well-documented &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9736833/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; even links prolonged cider-vinegar consumption to hypokalemia and subsequent osteoporosis, showing how sustained misuse can impact bone health.

It can lower blood glucose and magnify the effect of diabetes medications, risking hypoglycaemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can lower potassium and thus increase toxicity risk with drugs like digoxin. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and some laxatives may also interact. If you’re on prescription medicine, discuss ACV with your clinician before starting regular use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slowed gastric emptying, a hidden hazard for people with diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising to many, vinegar can delay &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2245945/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;gastric emptying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. For people with diabetic gastroparesis, that means worse glycaemic control and unpredictable blood sugar swings; even for others, slowed digestion can cause nausea and bloating. A controlled study showed vinegar reduced gastric emptying rates in people with type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chemical burns and skin damage from topical use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of “natural equals safe” is costly when people apply undiluted ACV to the skin.

Investigations of commercial products, especially tablets and some branded preparations, found wide variability in pH, acid content and label claims; some products were pasteurised or filtered (removing the “mother”), others had much lower or inconsistent acetic acid levels than advertised. In short: many commercial varieties are not truly aged, unpasteurized, or standardized, which undermines both safety and the very benefits people expect. Consumers should prefer reputable, clearly labelled raw/unfiltered products and treat supplements with caution, checking for ingredient transparency, manufacturing origin, and expiry dates to ensure authenticity and consistent quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical guidance (short and clinical)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t drink undiluted ACV.

If you use ACV for a specific reason, set a time limit and monitor side effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t apply undiluted vinegar to skin. For oral health, avoid swishing ACV and rinse with water after use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple cider vinegar can be useful in the kitchen and has some modest, documented metabolic effects. But it is an acid first and a remedy second. Used recklessly, chronically, undiluted, or in unreliable commercial forms, it can cause serious, preventable harm. Nutrition experts should be louder about the risks, and patients should expect clear, evidence-based advice before making ACV a daily habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19疫苗可以帮助一些癌症患者对抗肿瘤- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The most widely used &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients – revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00063b6qyepwfa39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/4c83cc7cc92a430b8c026691e77815c2" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy drugs&lt;/a&gt; lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00073b6q6epnm2ri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it had nothing to do with virus infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00083b6qj2jml1sn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mrna-kennedy-rfk-jr-covid-flu-51babaaeb003c45473080a52d67d7d72" target="_blank"&gt;the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00093b6qvo9ahzw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000a3b6qjky8kzw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank"&gt;cutting $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for some uses of the technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000b3b6qfym710z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000c3b6qgq5f5j1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPsgoqfas&amp;amp;list=PLslqZ7OaczKEUNNDVq-u_OE31P2k7UwKc&amp;amp;index=19" target="_blank"&gt;Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000d3b6q0z0vw6l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-71306bd18785477f3a85a69caa6e09c9" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000e3b6qvcrqmhrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000f3b6qqx2m7dp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000g3b6qjf4hfwyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000h3b6qajtq56em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000i3b6qgagydoxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000j3b6qhe6ovmbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once your profile is live, you can begin scrolling. “Around 70 per cent of donors on the app offer their sperm for free,” says Sofie Hafström Kritsotaki, the app’s co-founder. “While around 40 per cent of future parents are willing to pay the donor for their support.” When you search for a match on the app, you can stipulate whether you want the donation to be “free” or “with compensation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From what we know, if they agree on compensation, it’s usually in the range of £50-£100, to cover time spent and travel costs. This is not arranged through our platform, but between the parties themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many donors include both current and childhood photos, giving prospective parents a glimpse of their future child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is Juan*, 31, from Catalonia, who prefers “intercourse” as a method of donation; or Stephen*, 41, a bus driver from Somerset seeking home insemination via a clinic. “Always wanted to be a dad but the situation never arose,” he writes. “Not sure it will ever happen for me before I’m too old, but I want to help others achieve their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many women, these platforms offer a pragmatic alternative to the high costs and long waiting lists of licensed clinics. Despite several regulated sperm banks across the UK, supply remains chronically short. Under HFEA rules, an official donor’s sperm can only be used to create a maximum of 10 families – a limit designed to reduce the risk of accidental genetic links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official fertility treatment, meanwhile, can be financially crippling. Intrauterine insemination (IUI), where prepared sperm is placed directly into the womb, costs around £1,500 per cycle privately, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/parenting/fertility/beginners-guide-to-ivf/"&gt;in vitro fertilisation (IVF)&lt;/a&gt; – where the egg and sperm are combined in a lab and the embryo is then transferred to the uterus – substantially more. NHS coverage varies by region and is often available only after multiple paid cycles have failed. For many single women and same-sex couples, conception through official channels feels financially out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That economic reality has created a shadow system. And despite the potential pitfalls, unregulated donation offers something the clinics cannot: choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hi, how picky do you think you can be?” one woman asks on Sperm Donors UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I was to conceive a son, is it too picky to try to find a donor who also has thick, full hair?” A donor replies: “Absolutely you can be picky. I won’t donate to overweight and unhealthy-looking women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Natalie Lovejoy, 42, from Wiltshire, it was less about choosiness than practicality. “I still hadn’t met anyone and, two years ago, I realised dating apps were awful, and my relationships weren’t going anywhere,” she says. “I know I want a baby, so I’m going to have a baby, and then love will come later.”&lt;/p&gt;

They also were more likely to say that they lost weight, were able to concentrate more, and had better energy than they did before. The researchers even noticed physical changes, like the participants had better blood pressure, vascular health, and liver function, and had less &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a64254355/supplements-for-insulin-resistance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered a precursor to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who cut back—but didn’t quit entirely—saw some improvements in those health metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants were also more likely to drink less and have less signs of alcohol use disorder during a six-month follow-up. Dry January “likely provided an opportunity for self-reflection,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fcitations%3Fuser%3DmyHwm9EAAAAJ%26hl%3Den&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69123057%2Fsober-october-no-alcohol-benefits-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Megan Strowger, PhD;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Megan Strowger, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and post-doctoral research associate at University at Buffalo. “Dry January is a great opportunity to re-evaluate your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does skipping alcohol for a month benefit your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, alcoholic drinks have calories, and they can also impact how much people eat, says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/susan-kelly-weeder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; researcher and dean of the George Washington University School of Nursing. “People often eat after drinking in an attempt to decrease the impact of the alcohol and so consume extra calories,” she says, adding that drinking lowers inhibitions, which could further influence what and how much you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being at an unhealthy weight can raise the risk of a host of health issues, while cutting out alcohol can help with healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, alcohol can mess with your sleep, which can impact your physical and mental health, Kelly-Weeder points out. “Most adults do not get enough quality sleep and we know that alcohol use interferes with deep restful sleep,” she says. “Once alcohol is eliminated, people begin to sleep better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the mental health side, alcohol can do a number on your brain, Strowger says. “Alcohol’s reputation is people having fun and the social benefits, but alcohol is fundamentally a depressant. Over time, that can impact mood, happiness, and mental health. By removing that influence in a short period [like Sober October or Dry January], it allows the brain to stabilize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you cut back (but don't quit)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found you can still see health perks if you just drink here and there. “The key takeaway is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reduction in alcohol consumption helps,” Strowger says. Even if someone didn’t fully avoid alcohol for the entire month, cutting back from their usual amount resulted in some health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts say it’s a good idea to reduce your alcohol use when you can. “Every little bit helps,” Kelly-Weeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:36:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5oOFJ3VlpSV2NPVnA3S0Vhb1ZaZk02dHFFQXRaMkFJY2hlMnkxdlRkZ1RxaWQ5RTgzXzI4R3loSjA1UVFKSkN5M0xnNTRadjR1NEE5R0ltaTV6ZVMtUGNhRFdBeU9YUHRoRGZKRWszU2RTLV9sal9oWGdjdTI</guid></item><item><title>头发灰白可能会带来令人惊讶的健康益处- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/there-could-be-a-surprising-health-benefit-to-having-gray-hair-81293</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;Going gray is an inevitable, and for many, undesirable, part of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/aging" target="_blank"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, but health-wise, it’s no bad thing – it could reflect the body’s natural defense against cancer, new research in mice suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only gate-screenreader--text"&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from the University of Tokyo, investigated how hair follicle stem cells responded to DNA damage, and in doing so, revealed a surprising link between &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/scientists-pinpoint-how-stress-turns-hair-gray-54754" target="_blank"&gt;gray hair&lt;/a&gt; and melanoma – a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of their lifetime, our cells face continuous stress, from both internal and environmental sources, collectively termed the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/does-your-dna-predict-your-destiny-68724" target="_blank"&gt;exposome&lt;/a&gt;. This stress can damage our DNA, which contributes to both aging and cancer, although exactly how has remained a mystery, especially when it comes to stem cell damage and long-term tissue health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/stem-cells" target="_blank"&gt;Stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are unique cells that can self-renew and develop into many different cell types in the body. Depending on where they are found, stem cells can develop into different tissues. Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs), for example, reside in the hair follicle and can differentiate into mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give our hair and skin their color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind the new study used a mouse model to identify how McSCs respond to different types of DNA damage. They found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks – where the phosphate backbone of both DNA strands is broken – McSCs irreversibly differentiate and are lost, leading to hair graying. This process is known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, when the stem cells were exposed to some carcinogens, they avoided this differentiation pathway, even when the DNA was damaged, retaining their ability to self-renew and divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when placed under stress, McSCs face a decision: to differentiate and exit the system, resulting in graying, or carry on dividing, which may eventually lead to a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates – exhaustion or expansion – depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” co-lead author Professor Emi Nishimura explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are keen to stress that their findings do not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, merely that seno-differentiation induced by stress could protect against harmful cells while simultaneously steering hair toward a silvery fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the research was carried out in mice, so we shouldn’t make any assumptions about our own species just yet, but it certainly helps to further our understanding of the process of hair graying and how it relates to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:34:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcWI1T0NqVm4yaHNacEhGQnprcG9ZNUdpcHI3QTlBLUo2dXp3aGRaX3NHTVRkMnp3U0JQS2hqbmVXUWk0Q1ZUZjRsV1V6M0diZ2JXMEtMM3JMaUUyRS1NaFdWaUFOMHI1eDByUlYzWDBlQVJEZEtVY3FqOGtQemd6RzNUejBiWWpUNGpIcml5S1JnbXJ2Q0FlQUFnQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁后保持大脑敏锐的5个简单日常习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-simple-daily-habits-to-keep-your-brain-sharp-after-40/photostory/124761393.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain nutrients like omega-3s, antioxidants, and vitamins play an important role in brain health, and so they should be included in one's daily diet to boost memory and brain functioning.
