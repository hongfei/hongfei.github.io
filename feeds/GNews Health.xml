It is becoming more important as women live longer − it ages more than twice as fast as other organs, and its decline doesn’t just impact fertility. Ovarian aging has widespread effects on women’s health, increasing the risk of age-related diseases and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here's a closer look at why the ovary affects health, how you can stay healthier longer, and ways researchers are trying to better understand this often-overlooked but crucial organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Living longer, but not necessarily better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women live longer than men on average, but they end up &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;spending more time living with diseases or disabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that health outcomes are closely tied with menopause and declining ovarian function. Before reaching menopause, women are less likely than men of the same age to develop cardiovascular disease, but once they reach 55, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2894539/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their risk becomes greater than men’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The risk of dying from a cardiovascular event is higher for women who experience menopause earlier in life, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a study in the Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5177476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that experiencing menopause later in life made it more likely someone would live to 90 and that earlier menopause increased the risk of dying younger. And a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/2/2/fcaa185/5977090?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;paper published in the journal Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt; showed women with longer reproductive windows were better protected against progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It’s not only deadly diseases that are linked to ovarian health; women also experience &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550857906801981?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more chronic, non-life-threatening illness&lt;/a&gt; than men after age 45.  As ovaries age, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/108/8/1835/7192004?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline increases.&lt;/a&gt;  Some experts say that delaying ovarian aging could help women avoid a cascade of health problems and live healthier longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Why is it OK to extend our lifespan as much as we are and not try to live healthier longer? And I think for women, this discussion of health span really has to include reproductive function,” said Francesca Duncan, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How do ovaries work?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At birth, an ovary contains anywhere from &lt;a href="https://johnsonlab.github.io/blog-post-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;100,000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79488-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;to 2 million&lt;/a&gt; tiny fluid-filled sacs called follicles. Each follicle holds an immature egg and cells that support the egg's development. The number of follicles varies greatly, but one thing is certain: Every woman is born with all of the follicles she will ever have. Only &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128132098000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;about 300,000&lt;/a&gt; may remain by the time she reaches puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The path from follicle to egg is remarkably long. While we think of the menstrual cycle as a monthly event, a woman's period is more than a year in the making. At any moment, there is a lot happening in the ovary − some follicles are just beginning their recruitment process (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28723025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;about 1,000 are recruited&lt;/a&gt; each month), others are growing, and a few are nearing maturity. This ongoing, overlapping cycle makes ovarian function complex and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;From each cohort of about 1,000 follicles, only one typically reaches maturity and ovulates, releasing an egg for fertilization. The others are degraded by the ovary. Why certain follicles survive remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s like a ball of balls, little tiny different-size balls, and each one of those different balls is going through this incredible remodeling at the level of cells. They change what kind of hormones they make, they change the way they look, they change what their function is across time,” said Jennifer Garrison, an associate professor based at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the Center for Healthy Aging in Women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A symphony of hormones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Despite being known as reproductive organ, the ovary does much more, Garrison said. “I genuinely do think that calling them reproductive organs has really made women’s health small. Focusing it through the lens of fertility has really made it seem small, and we have to make it clear that we are talking about the health of women, period.“  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Only about 400 to 500 follicles release an egg during a woman’s life. Thousands of others die off, but before they do, the supporting cells inside produce hormones. These hormones communicate with their egg and with the ovary, regulating the menstrual cycle, but also have many other functions enabled by receptors throughout the body. Traveling through the bloodstream to the brain, bones, blood vessels, breasts and other organs with receptors, hormones affect bone and heart health, metabolism and overall well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Garrison studies these two-way dynamic chemical conversations and likens the process to a symphony in which hormones act as notes, creating an interplay between ovaries and organs. “Your ovaries are communicating via hormones, and not just the ones you know about but probably dozens if not hundreds of hormones talking to your bones, to your brain, to your liver, talking to your muscle, talking to almost every other organ in your body.” As ovaries decline, hormones change, and a harmonious symphony can turn into a cacophonous noise, impacting the entire body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We don't understand those individual conversations. We have no idea how most of them work. But what we do know is what happens when either ovaries aren't working properly, or when you take them away, and so we can infer what the contribution of ovaries is to say, for example, bone density,” Garrison said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Take one of the hormones ovaries produce: estrogen. Estrogen is essential to bone health because it promotes the activity of osteoblasts, the cells that make new bone. During menopause, women lose about 10% of their bone density on average, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5643776/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;some could lose up to 20%&lt;/a&gt; in the first five years. A drop in estrogen also affects &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;skeletal muscle mass and strength,&lt;/a&gt; increasing the risk of fractures from falls.  After age 50, as many as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328201006147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;1 in 2 women (but only 1 in 5 men)&lt;/a&gt; break a bone. &lt;a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-024-00418-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; postmenopausal women, particularly those with early menopause, may be at higher risk for rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen also influences many areas of the brain. Longer exposure to estradiol, the type of estrogen produced by the ovaries during a woman's reproductive years, may help keep the brain healthier and lower the risk of certain diseases. For example, earlier menopause is associated with increased risk of dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00210-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a 2023 study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women are protected from heart disease during their reproductive years because estrogen helps expand blood vessels, grow new ones and lower inflammation. Better blood flow reduces strain on the heart, and wider blood vessels reduce resistance in circulation, leading to lower blood pressure. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074318/#:~:text=Women%20develop%20heart%20diseases%20later,after%20menopause%20in%20most%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the risk of heart disease increases&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8554369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;helps regulate blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; by supporting insulin production, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing fat storage and inflammation. The hormone also plays a role in maintaining brain function and metabolism, ensuring the body uses glucose for energy efficiently. The drop in estrogen associated with menopause makes it more likely that women will gain weight around the abdomen, increasing the risk of conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What goes wrong with ovaries over time? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The number of follicles progressively declines with age. By age 30, most women have &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;only about 12%&lt;/a&gt; of the egg cells they were born with. After a certain point they lose follicles at a faster rate, though it’s not known why. By age 40, a mere 3% may remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The quality of follicles also worsens with age, and they are more likely to have defects. For example, if a follicle releases an egg, the egg might have missing chromosomes or have too many, which makes it harder to get pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Countless cycles of follicular growth also leave their mark on ovaries. A thousand follicles dying so that one can make it to the final stage means there is a lot of debris for the body to clean up. Many other organs experience more gradual wear and tear with age, but the ovary has an immense degree of cellular turnover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As a follicle reaches ovulation, it ruptures to release an egg, leaving a temporary wound behind on the surface of the ovary, which must then heal. According to Duncan, this process normally occurs hundreds of times in a woman’s life, and over time these micro-injuries degrade the ovary’s structural integrity affecting its function. All of this means the ovary becomes stiffer with age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It's maybe not so stark as a sponge to a rock,” Duncan said. “But that's the idea, that you're going from something that's very soft to something that's very rigid and tough.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As all of these issues accumulate the once tightly regulated system where hormones fluctuate in predictable cycles begins to break down. That’s when perimenopause begins, a phase that can last for a decade before menstruation stops completely. The body is no longer receiving the level of hormones it has been accustomed to since puberty. Many women start having hot flashes, have trouble sleeping and experience vaginal dryness. Some experience mood changes and brain fog. As many as 135 different symptoms are associated with perimenopause and can come at various intensities. Ultimately this phase is followed by menopause, defined as 12 full months since a woman's last menstrual period. By that time, a woman has about 1,000 follicles remaining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5558404/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Many things can influence&lt;/a&gt; when a woman will reach menopause: not only her mother’s age at menopause but the timing of her first period, her body mass index, lifestyle choices, use of birth control, number of pregnancies, and other factors like education and income level. Women with cancer going through chemotherapy or radiation often have accelerated ovarian aging. Endocrine disrupting chemicals &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39222443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;may also cause a woman to go through menopause earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The end of periods doesn’t mean the ovaries stop working; they &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2022.2141618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;continue to make&lt;/a&gt; estrogen at much lower levels as well as testosterone. Rather, menopause means the end of menstruation and fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Some women will be postmenopausal and for whatever reason be advised to have their ovaries removed surgically, and they can feel the difference,” said Cynthia Stuenkel, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ovarian problems can affect a woman's health at any age. For a 10-year-old girl, ovarian dysfunction could mean trouble going through puberty, irregular menstrual cycles, or even acne. Garrison says that for a woman in her 20s, it might uncover risks of autoimmune disorders or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. By the time a woman reaches her 30s, ovarian problems are more commonly linked to infertility and miscarriages. And after menopause, the risks shift again − heart disease, osteoporosis and cognitive decline become bigger concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done to manage ovarian decline? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lifestyle changes are probably the most important tools, Stuenkel said. Regular exercise − especially strength training − &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9864448/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;helps protect bone and muscle health,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10780928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;a good diet can help counteract metabolic changes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also important to manage stress and get enough sleep. Though lifestyle changes can’t stop ovarian aging, they can ease the transition and lower long-term health risks. There are also many options for managing symptoms, such as &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/wp-content/uploads/professional/2023-nonhormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;nonhormonal drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hormone therapy is another option. The treatment seeks to &lt;a href="https://but/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;replicate ovarian function&lt;/a&gt; by replenishing hormones depleted during menopause. It is most often used to treat hot flashes and vaginal discomfort. The therapy was prescribed for decades before its use dropped sharply in 2002 after a &lt;a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3mr6f93p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study&lt;/a&gt; linked it to slightly higher risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2818206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;In May 2024, a review highlighted&lt;/a&gt; that the hormones, doses and delivery methods used in the WHI trials were different from modern treatments. Unlike the oral-only therapy in the study, today's patches use lower doses of hormones which are identical to the ones made by the body, and may reduce risks, according to the review. The timing also matters - most WHI participants started therapy a decade after menopause, which may have affected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Starting hormone replacement closer to menopause may be much more effective, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1505241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to another study&lt;/a&gt;. Though hormone therapy may benefit heart health if started early in menopause, it's generally not recommended for women who already have a high risk of heart disease, stroke or a history of coronary problems, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a review led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee.&lt;/a&gt; But &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00270-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;research indicates&lt;/a&gt; long-term benefits of the therapy could outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The treatment does have its limits: Estrogen and progesterone in premenopausal women are tightly regulated in cycles, but hormone replacement therapy provides a constant dosage while wearing a patch, or a spike when taking a pill. Also, estrogen receptors, which can be compared to locks on cells with estrogen being the key that activates them, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10327608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;may decrease with age.&lt;/a&gt; This means that even if estrogen is available via replacement therapy, cells may be less responsive to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How can women keep track of what’s going on with their ovaries?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unlike other organs where function can be measured with routine tests, there is no simple diagnostic tool to track ovarian aging. The biggest clue is something most women are already familiar with: their period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regular cycles signal ovaries are producing hormones in a predictable rhythm, while irregular or skipped periods can be an early indication of decline. For many women, the first sign of approaching menopause isn’t a sudden change but a slow and erratic shift in their cycles. &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/od/directors_corner/prev_updates/menstrual-cycles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menstrual irregularities can also indicate&lt;/a&gt; stress, hormonal imbalances, gynecological diseases and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Vital signs in medicine are things like heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and temperature,” Stuenkel said. “Those are the key. When we get a new patient in the hospital, the attendants say, 'Tell me the vital signs.' I really like the concept of the menstrual cycle as a vital sign because it tells you so much about women's health.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But women who take hormonal contraception may not experience obvious menstrual changes at all, and those who have conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome may already have irregular periods. There are also women with regular periods who want to know how fertile they are. In this case, doctors measure the level of Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is made by follicles. They can also check the antral follicle count (AFC), or the number of follicles, in the later part of their journey toward possible ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to Garrison, current methods provide only a snapshot rather than a complete picture of a woman's ovarian health trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Can women delay ovarian aging? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts say that reproductive aging is greatly under-researched. A lack of suitable organisms to model and study human menopause makes it challenging to develop interventions, as does &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-024-00253-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sex bias and lack of funding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This touches every single person with ovaries. It's a tremendous problem, and there's a tremendous opportunity,” said Kara Goldman, associate professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility and director of fertility preservation at Northwestern Medicine. “But there aren't that many people focusing on it, and the funding is very limited. And so, I think that the progress will be halted if there isn't proper funding to continue this work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An emerging trend known as decentralized science is exploring ways to raise money for early-stage research through community-driven efforts. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.athenadao.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;AthenaDAO&lt;/a&gt; − a self-described decentralized community of researchers, funders and advocates − is funding research on women’s health, including ovarian aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are only a handful of companies focused on reproductive longevity. One of them is &lt;a href="https://www.ovivatx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Oviva Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the early stages of testing whether a pharmaceutical version of anti-Müllerian hormone, which helps regulate how many follicles start developing each menstrual cycle, could help reduce egg loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some scientists are exploring compounds that may show promise in other areas of aging and applying them to ovarian health. Rapamycin is an antifungal approved by the FDA as an immune suppressor that prevents organ recipients from rejecting a new organ. Rapamycin prolonged life when given to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19458476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;yeast,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;worms,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00278-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;flies and mice&lt;/a&gt; and has raised hopes of possibly slowing down the aging process in humans. One study is testing whether it can slow ovarian aging, delay menopause, extend fertility and reduce risks of age-related disease. The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; plans to include more than 1,000 women and has 50 participants so far. Early results suggest rapamycin could slow ovarian aging by 20%. Participants have reported better health, memory, energy, and skin and hair quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duncan, the professor at Northwestern, is focused on using ovarian stiffness as a way to track ovarian aging through noninvasive imaging and as a target for treatment. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01322-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Her research shows&lt;/a&gt; that reducing fibrosis in the ovary with medication may help preserve hormone production, improve ovulation and possibly slow ovarian decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another strategy could be ovarian cryopreservation. A small piece of ovarian tissue is frozen and later replaced, a technique used to preserve fertility in cancer patients. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11625473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Mathematical models suggest&lt;/a&gt; the procedure could significantly delay menopause. But obtaining and freezing ovarian tissue requires surgery, which could carry risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;More research is needed to understand the future of women’s health &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Women who go through menopause after 55 have a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cancer/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;breast,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ovarian-cancer/causes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ovarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6560333/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;endometrial&lt;/a&gt; cancers. This is likely because they have been exposed to estrogen for a longer time. The risk may be higher for women who started their periods early, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3488186/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Institute of Health's National Library of Medicine. Other risks of delaying ovarian aging may remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This is why we have to study it. And I think that the assumption is that the benefits of prolonged ovarian function would far outweigh the risks,” Goldman said. “We need to be able to offer treatments to women when they ask, ‘I understand that my ovaries are aging; what can I do about it?’ And my answer right now is there is not much we can do, and we are studying, and we are working, and we want to answer these questions, but we don't have answers.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another concern about delaying ovarian aging is the assumption that it could mean women have periods and remain fertile in the later decades of life, even if their bodies may no longer be able to support a pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We're not trying to just extend this function just so people can have a million babies, but to really make sure that the endocrine function is matching how long we are living,” Duncan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ovarian aging could be an area where a personalized approach may make a big difference. For example, women could take molecules that act like estrogen but are designed to target only certain tissues − supporting bone, brain and muscle while avoiding unwanted effects on breast tissue, according to Garrison. She imagines a future when instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, women could take a combination of compounds tailored to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“There should be a diagnostic panel that would tell you like, here's what's most likely to work for you, and there should be a menu of options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contributing: Ramon Padilla and Shawn J.

&lt;p&gt;Mental health can be a tricky beast: you can be doing fine one day and the next feel as though the world is crashing down around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have lived with generalized anxiety and a panic disorder for over a decade, and while I’ve grown much better at managing my symptoms with medication, mindfulness and therapy, sometimes they pop up again for no identifiable reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened to me last week, after many months of uninterrupted calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My anxiety symptoms are often very physical: manifesting as pain, an upset stomach, and heart palpitations, as well as the spinning thoughts and sense of fear usually associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even when experiencing symptoms like these, the demands of life don’t let up, and most importantly, the dog still needs walkies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having experienced periods of agoraphobia in the past, it is vitally important to me that I continue to leave the house, even just for short spells, to prevent my world from getting any smaller. Dog walks are a great way to do this, plus they squeeze a little cardiovascular exercise into my day and provide me with valuable bonding time with my pet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the mental state I was in, I needed a tool to pull my focus away from my spiralling thoughts and take some of the overwhelm away from the idea of going outside. That’s when I came across color walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wPfyP9cop2HtFiJpyrNs9C" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wPfyP9cop2HtFiJpyrNs9C slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-color-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is color walking?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind color walking is simple: you select a color and try to spot it wherever it appears on your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s TikTok creator &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jazhand" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@jazhand" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jaz Hand&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating a color walk where she seeks out the color yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add a level by taking photos of where you see the color, or just make a mental note when you observe it and take a few moments to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend encourages participants to reflect on the color, notice the exact shade, and see how it fits into the environment and interacts with other visual aspects, like light and texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, you engage with your environment and appreciate the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-color-walking-helped-me"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How color walking helped me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having successfully tried &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-walking-yoga-and-i-was-amazed-by-how-calm-it-made-me-feel" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-tried-walking-yoga-and-i-was-amazed-by-how-calm-it-made-me-feel"&gt;walking yoga&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to try a similarly mindful practice, but one that was slightly less focused on how my body felt, because I was in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having seen some colleagues try color walking, I decided this might be a good option to try myself, so I laced up my walking shoes, leashed my dog and went out to look for yellow things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / Kosamtu)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-gave-me-something-to-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It gave me something to focus on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can give myself panic attacks while sitting in a dark room with no external stimuli—they’re a consequence of my thoughts, which can spiral out of control very easily. There isn’t always a definite trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindful practices are helpful in these situations because they interrupt the thoughts before they can spiral and fill the space in my head that would otherwise be taken up by worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing inward on my thoughts and how anxious I was feeling, I was able to think about spotting some yellow, and then some more yellow, and some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found yellow in surprising places: blue flowers with yellow centers, the flash of yellow on the tail of a green woodpecker, even some graffiti on a bin. I was so absorbed in my quest that I was able to put aside my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time I got home again, I was calmer, happier and had achieved something. All big wins on a bad mental health day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-cheered-me-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It cheered me up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose yellow because it has been my favorite color since I was small. Something about the bright shades of sunflowers, bumblebees and lemons has always lifted my mood, and it’s the color I choose to paint my nails when I’m feeling particularly sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also one of the first colors of spring where I live, appearing in daffodils and buttercups, meaning I also associate it with the promise of sunshine and longer days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking out little patches of yellow made me notice just how much of it there is in the world, which helped me to feel happier, despite my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-helped-me-manage-my-anxiety"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It helped me manage my anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety management can take many forms, and although I try to lean towards holistic techniques like mindfulness and meditation, I need medication too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taking a powerful &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24570-benzodiazepines-benzos" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24570-benzodiazepines-benzos" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; every time I want to go outside is neither practical nor healthy. They’re a dependence-building drug and one that I try not to take unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead of popping a pill before leaving the house, I started in my kitchen (the first room in my house), which is littered with yellow pots, pans, plants and crockery. I started my color walk indoors, looking for my chosen color in my own home before I took myself outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period of transition helped me to adjust to the task at hand, without feeling overwhelmed by it. By thinking of what I was doing as just “looking for the color yellow” rather than the much more intimidating “going outside where there are people, cars and all sorts of other triggers and terrible things that could go wrong,” it took some of the fear out of the experience and made it more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I relied on color walks over this horrible week until I finally began to feel more stable, and will continue to do so on difficult days to keep myself feeling calm, comfortable and maybe even a bit happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You feel it every time you go up the stairs, type an email or even make a delicious dinner—joint pain can touch almost every part of your day. It can affect just about anyone, at any time, depending on where and how it shows up. But what if there was a simple way to ease the ache—or even prevent it in the first place? According to some experts and social media, collagen can be it. So, does it actually work? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the early 2000s, that “miracle fix” seemed to be glucosamine and chondroitin. Though the combo is still commercially available and many swear by its benefits, many studies have shown that it may not make a significant difference when it comes to treating osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

While collagen is typically known for its skin and hair benefits, many users are also turning to it for joint health. Still, there are plenty of voices in the mix for that, too. So, what’s the real story? Can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021032/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-collagen-powder-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;collagen truly help keep your joints feeling strong&lt;/a&gt;?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We dug into the research and spoke with orthopedic surgeon &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/sean-peden" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sean Peden, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in foot and ankle care but has a broad understanding of orthopedics. “Everybody's looking for something that's going to affect the future,” he explains. “And I think there's some promise, both from a research and from a theoretical point of view. There are reasons to believe in it, so I think that's why it's getting popular.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body—making up around 30% of the total protein in most mammals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are 28 known types of collagen, but about 90% of it is Type I, which is found in skin, bones, muscles and connective tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Type II collagen, however, plays a key role in joint health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Type II collagen, which is a specialized form, is really what you find in articular cartilage, which means joints, and that's the one that probably were the most focused on as orthopedic surgeons, because that type, that cartilage and joints, has very little reparative capacity,” says Peden. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, once the collagen in your joints starts to break down (a natural part of aging), your body has a hard time restoring it. This can lead to familiar issues, such as stiffness, limited range of motion and chronic discomfort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Articular cartilage wear is equivalent to degenerative arthritis,” Peden explains. “This kind of cartilage has very poor ability to heal itself, especially once we are fully grown. The breakdown becomes accelerated with age, and the risk increases with things like increased body mass and trauma. As we get older, this specific cartilage increases its water content, and the collagen becomes less organized and more vulnerable to damage.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-collagen-supplements-affect-your-joints"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Collagen Supplements Affect Your Joints &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, where do supplements come in? The idea is that taking collagen—often in type II form—might encourage the body to produce more of it, helping to maintain or even rebuild cartilage. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there might be some promise, Peden says that “Many doctors aren't gung-ho about recommending it, because the data is just not there.” For instance, a small 2016 study found that after three months of treatment, collagen with acetaminophen improved knee pain more effectively than acetaminophen alone—but the sample size was small (just 39 participants), so further research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And one 2023 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; notes that while “available research suggests a clear link between collagen ingredient composition/chemical structure and mechanism of action/efficacy, further research is required, including well-designed studies, to assess the therapeutic potential of each collagen type and composition for each clinical condition.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, there really isn’t enough good research to back claims just yet. That said, Peden notes that collagen supplements are generally a safe product to take.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to try it, you’ll typically find &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067695/best-ways-to-take-collagen/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;collagen in powders, capsules or liquid form&lt;/a&gt;. Many people prefer capsules because they don’t like the flavor of liquids and powders. According to most brands, you notice any differences after taking it for 8 to 12 weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-so-is-a-collagen-supplement-right-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; So, Is a Collagen Supplement Right for You? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most healthy people, there’s little downside to trying collagen supplements. However, there are a few things to know before you start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support it with other nutrients: &lt;/strong&gt;Collagen synthesis relies on key vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C, zinc and copper.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many supplements already include these, but a well-rounded, nutrient-rich diet will help, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your source:&lt;/strong&gt; Collagen can be derived from cows, pigs, fish and eggs. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, read the label closely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;/strong&gt;While collagen is considered safe—even during pregnancy—and has no significant known interactions with medications, it’s always a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-natural-ways-to-boost-collagen-and-support-joints"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3 Natural Ways to Boost Collagen and Support Joints &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more protein-rich foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Peden recommends that anyone with a musculoskeletal injury &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume sufficient protein&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, collagen is the most abundant protein in our body. “When you eat a piece of chicken, you're going to get a decent amount of collagen in there,” he says. However, he cautions that some of that collagen doesn’t get absorbed into your body. Still, eating highly collagenous foods like skin-on chicken, bone broths and whole fish, such as sardines, is a great way to get your collagen naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;Both resistance and cardio workouts help stimulate collagen production. “If you're using your muscles, the muscles are going to try to hypertrophy or get bigger,” says Peden. This helps with collagen production. If your joints are hurting, stick with low-impact exercises so they are achievable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: &lt;/strong&gt;Of course, exercise will probably have this effect, but Peden says that one of the most evidence-based ways to improve joint health is by not putting excessive weight on them. In fact, reducing body fat is one of the most effective ways to prevent osteoarthritis. According to an older study, reducing body fat can reduce the mechanical and biochemical stressors that contribute to joint degeneration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Collagen supplements may offer some joint-friendly benefits—but they’re not a cure-all. And while more science is needed to confirm this, taking a high-quality collagen product likely won’t do harm. When choosing a supplement, make sure it's independently verified, since the FDA does not regulate them. And be sure to talk to a healthcare provider before starting to take one. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most importantly, don’t let supplements replace what we do know works: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a nutrient-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;, moving your body and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7922773/best-way-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;. “I think that the problem sometimes with supplements like this, or with any alternative treatments, is that they can kind of distract patients from the things that are evidence-based, that we know are good,” says Peden. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you find that collagen does help you, you’ll be at the forefront of a promising trend.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet is key in managing arthritis, and broccoli has earned the top spot among vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli provides vitamins C and K, the antioxidant sulforaphane and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From sautéing and roasting to making pesto, there are many ways to get more broccoli in your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From troublesome joint pain to stiffness and swelling, arthritis can be incredibly uncomfortable. It’s also extremely common, affecting about 20% of adults in the United States—a stat that increases drastically with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medication, physical therapy and staying active are all key to managing arthritis. But there’s another important piece of the puzzle that’s often overlooked—diet. Among the many foods that may help with arthritis symptoms, broccoli stands out, especially among vegetables. Packed with antioxidants, essential nutrients and a powerful compound called sulforaphane, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-benefits-8653215" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt; is a solid choice if you’re dealing with pain, inflammation and other arthritis symptoms. “Including broccoli as part of your regular eating pattern may help support long-term anti-inflammatory benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is loaded with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;. “Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage, reduce inflammation and support the production of collagen, which is essential for healthy joints and connective tissues,” says &lt;a href="https://wellnesswhisk.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maxine Yeung, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just 1 cup of raw broccoli provides nearly 70 milligrams of vitamin C, meeting approximately 75% of the daily needs for adult men and about 100% of the recommended daily amount for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, an essential nutrient that’s important for bone health. It also has antioxidant properties, which help protect against inflammation and other damage from free radicals. “Vitamin K supports bone health and is linked to reducing inflammatory markers in the blood,” Yeung says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found a potential connection between higher vitamin K intake and a lower risk of developing osteoarthritis. Vitamin K may help slow the progression of the disease in those who already have the condition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is rich in fiber, which directly supports gut health and indirectly helps with joint health. “Gut health and joint health are interconnected through what we call the gut-joint axis,” Medhekar says. “An imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to inflammation affecting joint health.” Among many benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; supports gut health by feeding the good gut bacteria that help reduce inflammation. In a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med, &lt;/em&gt;researchers identified a link between poor gut health and increased rheumatoid arthritis severity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular, low-impact physical activity can reduce pain and improve physical function for people with arthritis. It also helps keep your joints and muscles strong. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight. &lt;/strong&gt;Research shows that maintaining a healthy weight can slow the progression of arthritis symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For people with obesity, even a small reduction in weight can improve symptoms and reduce pain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “While diet alone won’t resolve arthritis symptoms, making dietary changes, like cutting back on saturated fats and added sugars and eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and unsaturated fats, can be an important part of your overall management plan,” Yeung says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support your gut health. &lt;/strong&gt;Eating lots of nutrient-rich whole foods supports a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt;, “allowing the body to better absorb and utilize nutrients that promote bone and joint health,” Han says.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8280953/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more ginger and turmeric&lt;/strong&gt;. “Ginger and turmeric both have anti-inflammatory properties and hence help reduce pain and inflammation in arthritis patients,” Medhekar says. “Turmeric is especially helpful since it contains curcumin, which has very potent anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your prescribed medication.&lt;/strong&gt; “It is important to eat healthy to help with your joint health but also important to take your prescribed medications for your arthritis,” Medhekar says.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to revamp your diet to be more arthritis-friendly, incorporating broccoli is a great choice. This powerhouse vegetable provides vitamins C and K, which support collagen production and have antioxidant properties, helping protect against inflammation. Meanwhile, the fiber in broccoli helps support a healthy gut microbiome, which has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; benefits and may even lower arthritis severity. Finally, broccoli is an amazing source of sulforaphane, a compound found in many cruciferous vegetables that has been linked with reduced cartilage breakdown and inflammation, among other benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is surprisingly versatile, giving you endless options to add more to your meals. Consider roasting it, transforming it into pesto, grilling up a cheesy broccoli melt or sautéing it for an easy side dish.&lt;br&gt;

With time, the outer layer, the epidermis, thins out. It loses its ability to block external harm. Keratinocytes form most of this layer, moving upward to create the skin’s shield. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C (VC), widely known for its antioxidant power, has also been studied many times in the past for its ability to repair skin. New research adds a deeper genetic angle to its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;, shows how vitamin C thickens the skin by reactivating specific genes. It strengthens the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-skins-bacteria-could-be-a-natural-sunscreen/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; by encouraging cell renewal through epigenetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VC seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells,” explains Dr. Akihito Ishigami, Vice President at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology (&lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TMGHIG&lt;/a&gt;), who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via epigenetic changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-vitamin-c-the-basics"&gt;Understanding vitamin C – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C plays a critical role in human biology as a powerful antioxidant and essential cofactor in various enzymatic reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body uses it to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/"&gt;synthesize collagen&lt;/a&gt;, a key structural protein found in skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also assists in the production of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and aids in metabolizing certain amino acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C internally and must obtain it through diet – primarily from fruits and vegetables like oranges, kiwis, strawberries, bell peppers, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/broccoli-sprouts-have-more-nutritional-value-than-mature-broccoli/"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its structural and metabolic roles, vitamin C strengthens the immune system by supporting the function of white blood cells and enhancing skin’s barrier defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its antioxidant properties help neutralize free radicals, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-vitamin-c-thickens-skin"&gt;How vitamin C thickens skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to see how vitamin C affects &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-electronic-skin-gives-robots-the-human-touch/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; growth. But instead of testing on real human skin, they created lab-grown skin called human epidermal equivalents. These are 3D skin models that behave like real skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these models, the top layer is exposed to air, like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hormones-may-slow-skin-aging-and-reduce-wrinkles/"&gt;human skin&lt;/a&gt; facing the environment, while the bottom layer gets nutrients, just like how blood vessels nourish real skin from underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied vitamin C in two doses: 0.1 and 1.0 millimolar. After 7 days, they noticed that the living part of the skin became thicker, meaning more skin cells had grown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outermost dead &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/future-tech-will-track-emotions-through-changes-in-our-skin/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; layer didn’t change at this point. But by day 14, the living layer had thickened even more, and the outer dead layer had become thinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested that vitamin C was making the skin produce more keratinocytes, which are the main cells that build the protective barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitamin-c-speeds-up-cell-division"&gt;Vitamin C speeds up cell division&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples treated with vitamin C had more Ki-67-positive cells, markers of active division and showed faster skin regeneration. The study then looked into how vitamin C enabled this increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/28190908/vitamin-c_skin-regeneration_epigenetic_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/28190915/vitamin-c_skin-regeneration_epigenetic_1s.webp" alt="Vitamin C promotes epidermal regeneration by activating enzymes that help in activating genes and driving DNA demethylation—a process that reactivates genes involved in cell proliferation, ultimately enhancing keratinocyte growth and leading to thicker, healthier skin.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: TMIG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that vitamin C reactivates key genes by removing methyl groups from DNA. These methyl groups silence genes. Their removal allows the genes to turn on, promoting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teen-skin-bacteria-could-hold-the-secret-to-acne-prevention/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; cell growth and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-silenced-genes"&gt;Unlocking silenced genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TET enzymes carry out DNA demethylation. They transform 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step requires iron in its Fe2+ form. When iron becomes Fe3+, the process stops. Vitamin C donates electrons to turn Fe3+ back into Fe2+, keeping the process active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified more than 10,000 areas of DNA that became hypomethylated with vitamin C. Expression of 12 key genes rose between 1.6 to 75.2 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TET enzymes were blocked, the effects reversed. This confirmed the role of TET-mediated demethylation in skin thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-dna-structure-and-activity"&gt;Changing DNA structure and activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper supports these results with additional experiments. It describes how vitamin C promotes transcriptional activation by increasing chromatin accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C-treated skin showed elevated &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Chromatin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chromatin&lt;/a&gt; openness around growth-promoting genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows enrichment of open chromatin regions near gene bodies related to cell proliferation. These genes are essential in epidermal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It further proves vitamin C’s action by displaying upregulation of genes such as &lt;em&gt;DLX5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CXCL14&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;EFNA1&lt;/em&gt;. These genes promote &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/keratinocyte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;keratinocyte&lt;/a&gt; growth and skin structure organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the paper presents long-read sequencing data. This technique confirmed that vitamin C increases the expression of full-length, functional gene transcripts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strengthens the idea that vitamin C not only activates genes but does so in a way that results in usable proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-older-skin-responds-well-to-vitamin-c"&gt;Older skin responds well to vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest vitamin C can strengthen thin or aging skin. It works by restarting growth pathways that decline with age. It reactivates genes and supports cellular rebuilding at a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that VC helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation, making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults,” concludes Dr. Ishigami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study, and all of the research that preceded it, vitamin C may soon play a bigger role in daily skincare routines, not just as an antioxidant, but as a genetic rejuvenator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ishigami worked with Hokuriku University and &lt;a href="https://www.rohto.co.jp/global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Key contributors included Professors Ayami Sato, Yasunori Sato, and Toshiyuki Kimura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(25)00416-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 01:13:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNY3laX0FDOVBJaUFHNDF0TGRqcXJtRHprLVhRQXhFNGVEYjl0VVg2WGV1aWIxVlRNZ0pObmNrVURGX014dGdLclh2ZF9PWGpUelppOVhyeTBEaEgwN0VLaFZfanJzdzJEdzhOMWJvT29yTHNyUEVtdWp1dEtOQWQxYnlMcm9fLWJQNGltSVNOcUJUNG85YW1yWFJRUVNZTFE0dXVMMjI5aktCRmtoLTZtY0JWaw</guid></item><item><title>验光师分享了我们都应该停止使用的单眼产品- BuzzFeed | An Optometrist Shared The One Eye Product We Should All Stop Using - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE4xY2JVMWxGVnUtQTdzd3RPVmRCZ0YtX0Z5Rnl6eXdoT0ZTaGE2TDZOMnd4ZFNiRjR4bFZyRmFscmdJaVVnMGpBZ1c1emhza2UzT0pKaHU3bXc1ZTRyZkpzU2JrYW0tZzl6TWsw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;When your eye is irritated, as it may be with pink eye or certain allergies, the blood vessels located in the front of the eye will dilate and engorge. “That’s what causes the white part of the eye to look red and angry,” Holmes explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those blood vessels serve an important purpose — when inflamed, they indicate something is wrong, Holmes said. This could be due to a mild problem, such as a cold or dust in the eye, or it may be a symptom of a more &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/symptoms/eye-redness#:~:text=The%20white%20portion%20of%20the,infection,%20and%20other%20medical%20conditions." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;serious health condition&lt;/a&gt; like an infection, glaucoma or a corneal abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not normal to have a red, angry-looking eye,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red-eye relieving drops target these blood vessels to constrict and minimize their appearance. Temporarily, this makes the eyes white again, however, these drops could mask the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may make you think everything is OK with your eyes when really the can be something quite serious going on,” Holmes said. It’s a bandaid, not a fix, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That redness can help your eye doctor &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2010/0115/p137.html#:~:text=Red%20eye%20is%20the%20cardinal,common%20cause%20of%20red%20eye." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;detect eye diseases&lt;/a&gt;. With certain eye conditions, time is of the essence. Left untreated, they can worsen and &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/find-a-program-or-service/ophthalmology/eye-emergencies" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;lead to complications&lt;/a&gt;, including infections, and, in serious cases, vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, these drops may cause &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2021/06/eye-whitening-drops-what-you-need-know#:~:text=%22I%20do%20not%20recommend%20whitening,they%20ever%20would%20have%20been." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7900063" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a rebound effect&lt;/a&gt;. “As the eye drops wear off and nutrients and oxygen start to flow back through those blood vessels, they actually will dilate and engorge more than initially,” Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can then get trapped in a cycle: their eyes appear red and irritated, they use redness-relieving drops that provide temporary relief, but then the redness comes back — this time, even worse — and they use the drops again. In some cases, people become dependent on red-eye relieving drops and the underlying health issue is never addressed, Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are other remedies you can use instead. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

How could I have this and not know?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart attack deaths have spiked in the US, with recent Harvard research suggesting a 17 percent increase in the years following the Covid pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those researchers found many of these attacks occurred at home, suggesting symptoms or precursors had been 'missed' until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told Freedman her heart muscle was more than 30 millimeters thick, three times more than an average healthy person's, suggesting her condition was advanced despite her being only 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This usually happens in the septum, the wall dividing the heart's two bottom chambers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This crowds the heart's main pumping chamber, making it work harder to deliver blood throughout the body and triggering erratic heartbeats that can cause cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman soon began taking medications to decrease her heart rate, lower cholesterol and relax the heart, including beta blockers, blood thinners and statins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also implanted a defibrillator into her chest three months later, which jolts the heart from an irregular rhythm back into a normal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite losing 60 pounds in a year to put less stress on her heart, her symptoms did not improve and she 'was really limited.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniele Massera, Freedman's cardiologist, said: 'She could only walk six minutes on the treadmill. At 26, you’d expect much more. She was having fainting spells despite medical therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rachel wanted to avoid surgery at all costs, but if you faint and have a diagnosis of HCM, that’s a very high-risk situation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Freedman, pictured here, said she would have to catch her breath after walking up the subway stairs, going on a grocery run and even taking a shower because her heart muscle was three times thicker than normal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Freedman underwent a septal myectomy, a type of open-heart surgery meant to remove a portion of thickened heart tissue. She is now recently married and is pursuing a master's degree. Freedman is pictured here with her husband&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2020, 15 months after her diagnosis, Freedman underwent a septal myectomy, a type of open-heart surgery meant to remove a portion of thickened heart tissue. It generally takes three to four hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, Freedman completed four months of cardiac rehabilitation, which typically involves light cardio and strength workouts and education on heart-healthy interventions like diet and quitting smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly five years later, Freedman can keep up with her friends on hikes and walk up the stairs without having to stop and catch her breath. Her chest pain is gone, and she can now walk the Brooklyn Bridge to get home instead of taking the subway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also got married in 2022 and is pursuing a master's degree to become a high school guidance counselor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freedman said: 'To my doctors, I'd say, "Not only did you save my life, you changed my life."' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, these grinders hide valuable dental stem cells at their core, and may prove to be critical in the treatment of several serious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That routine visit to your dentist could soon double as the first step in a personalized medical plan, now that researchers have confirmed the teeth hide stem cells with a knack for rebuilding bone, cartilage, and even nerve tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Gaskon Ibarretxe, an associate professor in the Cell Biology and Histology Department at the &lt;a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-hidden-cells"&gt;Unlocking hidden cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every wisdom tooth shelters a soft core called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39849603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dental pulp&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular pocket that keeps the tooth alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have isolated pulp‑resident cells that behave like immature body builders, able to transform into neurons, heart muscle or bone, once coaxed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibarretxe’s team recently turned pulp cells into electrically excitable neuron‑like cells, that could fire the voltage spikes that real neurons use to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That jump from marker expression to genuine electrical activity is essential, because damaged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/big-changes-in-the-brain-between-the-ages-of-11-25-and-how-it-influence-our-decisions/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; circuits need cells that can send signals,” noted Ibarretxe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harvesting-stem-cells-from-teeth"&gt;Harvesting stem cells from teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 10 million wisdom teeth are removed in the United States every year. Most head straight to a biomedical‑waste bin, yet each freshly extracted tooth offers a painless harvest of living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists usually perform these surgeries on teens or young adults, an age sweet spot when pulp cells still divide briskly and carry few DNA errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratories already partner with oral‑surgery clinics to bank teeth on dry ice, then ship them to GMP‑grade freezers where the pulp is processed and stored in liquid nitrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stemodontics.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stemodontics&lt;/a&gt;, one such service, calls the practice “biological insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dental-stem-cells-are-medical-assets"&gt;Dental stem cells are medical assets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most extracted wisdom teeth are discarded without a second thought, but some companies now offer preservation kits to turn this waste into long-term medical assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kits are sent to dental offices ahead of time and include all materials needed to keep the dental stem cells in the pulp viable during transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike embryonic or cord blood stem cells, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24850632/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dental pulp stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are collected with minimal ethical concerns, since the tissue would otherwise be thrown away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes them a practical choice for expanding access to personalized regenerative therapies, especially as the cost of stem cell banking continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dental-stem-cells-and-disease"&gt;Dental stem cells and disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre‑clinical studies show that dental‑pulp cells can ease motor symptoms in rodent models of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; disease by replacing lost dopamine‑making neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; research, the same cells secrete growth factors that protect synapses and may slow the buildup of toxic proteins. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1440334/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; outlined how pulp‑derived cells help clear amyloid plaques and calm brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical momentum is growing. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-025-00036-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recently reported early‑phase trials in which stem‑cell implants survived and released dopamine in people with Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those trials used embryonic lines, dental stem cells may offer similar benefits without the ethical baggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-personal-biobank"&gt;Building a personal biobank&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banking one’s own dental stem cells eliminates immune‑rejection worries, and can shave months off treatment timelines that would otherwise require donor matching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraction logistics are straightforward: the oral surgeon places each tooth into a sterile vial, couriers rush the package to a lab, and technicians thaw, isolate, and freeze the pulp cells in under 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upfront fee rivals that of cord‑blood banking, yet the potential payoff spans decades because adult stem‑cell lines can be expanded repeatedly for multiple therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stem-cells-used-in-multiple-health-issues"&gt;Stem cells used in multiple health issues &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the nervous system, dental stem cells build mineralized tissue faster than bone‑marrow cells, making them attractive for use in jaw repair after tumor surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists have tested dental‑pulp secretions in mice with heart failure and found improved ejection fractions, hinting at the potential for future cardiac patches grown from a patient’s own molar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orthopedic researchers see value too: in vitro, the cells lay down collagen and calcium in orderly sheets that mimic healthy cartilage, a property that could revolutionize joint‑repair grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breakthrough-therapies-for-disease"&gt;Breakthrough therapies for disease &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators still need long‑term safety data, especially because transplanted cells must integrate without forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are drafting multicenter trials that compare pulp‑cell implants with standard deep‑brain stimulation for movement disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the dental stem cells restore function and trim health‑care costs, dentists may soon hand every patient a preservation kit along with post‑op ice packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field also faces equity questions: wisdom‑tooth banking should not become a luxury limited to families who can afford elective services. Public biobanks or insurance incentives could close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is simple: before tossing those molars, consider the regenerative gold hiding inside. The next breakthrough therapy for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-a-brain-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; disease or spinal‑cord injury may start with the tooth your dentist once called an inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04134-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 23:44:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPQWxYeWN4MFdaNVQxOXRoMk9wTC1ZRl9aOUROTmdLLTZJZ0RaREotRExqYWpxZjFxRDBZaC05WEJMYmdSb0dtRm14aXdjOGtuSlY5Q0VBSjZodHR0SlEtcFZEQUxSVHh5VGtJUk03ZlFoNWM5bTNHVHRDTmRXR0hzQlpJcTF0NklyTXZzaVFFVWhJMVVoQXZTQkppY0dfMlR3bl9nS1huaE90Zw</guid></item><item><title>一次性电子烟禁令：我给孩子买电子烟来控制他们的成瘾- BBC | Disposable vape ban: I buy my kids vapes to control their addiction - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5Nck05NFBlaFVrRTRNWGZxd3FPa0xuVlgwazFqUUY0T0tFM1FXejZMTjZ4MzZsc0ZXV1dMUlpHbDlkeXRjeHlUVkNzZVVwcmVTSnI2dEtCcDRJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE52UFFQaFhtUnZKcU9Dc2dFc2s1U3NYT1VxSVUzRXdqTjh2RlR0UE1NZUZOUmpYV2FsRVpZOU1nd2pDeGNNOENCVTh1U0JvV0pERkcxWUF4Nk9FVzhKalUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;I buy my children vapes to try to control their addiction&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Ruth Clegg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health and wellbeing reporter, BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b291/live/5f821370-5373-11f0-9fdf-1397077316aa.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A person holds a vape up to their mouth" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Emma is doing something she swore she would never do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In an attempt to have some control over her children's vaping habits, she's resorted to buying them the vapes herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She's not proud of it, but says it feels like the only way to keep her two teenagers safe and reduce the high levels of nicotine they were consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It went against every bone in my body to do that, but they're addicted," Emma says. "It's not a simple case of telling them to stop – it is so much harder than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Emma believes her son, who she has asked the BBC not to name, began vaping in primary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He managed to keep it from her for a while, but by the time he got to high school, his protests of "that vape's not mine" had started to wear thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By the time Emma's son was 15, he was becoming breathless, contracted tonsillitis, and, at one point, was in so much pain, Emma called an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The paramedics said the incessant vaping could be causing this," she says. "They told him to try and stop, or at the very least cut down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was then Emma decided something had to change – she was going to take control and buy the vapes - trying to reduce their nicotine intake from 20mg to 10mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I warned them – if I see them with a device that has more nicotine in – then I'll stop buying them any, full stop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Emma says she felt she could then be confident the vapes would be from a reputable supplier, they wouldn't be illegal and contain other harmful products, and she could control the level of nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Best of weekend picks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not only is it illegal to sell vapes to anyone under the age of 18, it is also &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx292klv29wo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;illegal to buy them for anyone underage&lt;/a&gt;. Emma knows what she is doing isn't legal, but feels this was her only choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She believes she has managed to reduce her son's nicotine intake, in part by buying the vapes, but also by having such an open conversation with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Emma says the disposable vape ban, which came into effect on 1 June, has had little impact on her children's nicotine consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was introduced due to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80kxx2xr77o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;environmental concerns and to reduce the rising number of children and young people vaping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While vapes provide a far healthier alternative to cigarettes, there are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction - with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavours and cheap prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-65809924" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;it may cause long-term damage to the lungs, heart and brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But weeks after the ban came into force, Kate Pike from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, says she fears it won't make any difference - and she says some rechargeable vapes, which are still legal to buy, are being marketed directly at children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are finding compliant products – vapes that are refillable and rechargeable – with packs of stickers in them," she says. "What adult is going to want to decorate their vape with stickers?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She also says it is very difficult to tell the difference between the now-illegal disposables and the legal refillable vapes. And due to some being fitted with pre-filled pods, they are still being used "like disposable vapes and discarded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A disposable vape (left), which is no longer legal to buy, and a prefilled vape (right), which is still available in shops&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;At Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, home to the UK's first NHS vaping clinic for children, Professor Rachel Isba says parents should not be hard on themselves – they are fighting a battle against the might of a huge vaping industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The important thing is not to judge your child; the world our young people live in is a difficult place to grow up in," she says.

				"I don't know what's wrong with me, but something is very bad — I'm very scared, and I need to go to the hospital," a man told his wife, after experiencing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis"&gt;what &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; calls a "ten-day descent into AI-fueled delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;" and "a frightening break with reality." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And a San Francisco psychiatrist tells the site he's seen similar cases in his own clinical practice.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The consequences can be dire. As we heard from spouses, friends, children, and parents looking on in alarm, instances of what's being called "ChatGPT psychosis" have led to the breakup of marriages and families, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises"&gt;the loss of jobs, and slides into homelessness&lt;/a&gt;.  And that's not all. As we've continued reporting, we've heard numerous troubling stories about people's loved ones being involuntarily committed to psychiatric care facilities — or even ending up in jail — after becoming fixated on the bot.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
"I was just like, I don't f*cking know what to do," one woman told us. "Nobody knows who knows what to do."  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Her husband, she said, had no prior history of mania, delusion, or psychosis. He'd turned to ChatGPT about 12 weeks ago for assistance with a permaculture and construction project; soon, after engaging the bot in probing philosophical chats, he became engulfed in messianic delusions, proclaiming that he had somehow brought forth a sentient AI, and that with it he had "broken" math and physics, embarking on a grandiose mission to save the world. His gentle personality faded as his obsession deepened, and his behavior became so erratic that he was let go from his job. He stopped sleeping and rapidly lost weight.  "He was like, 'just talk to [ChatGPT]. You'll see what I'm talking about,'" his wife recalled. "And every time I'm looking at what's going on the screen, it just sounds like a bunch of affirming, sycophantic bullsh*t."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Eventually, the husband slid into a full-tilt break with reality. Realizing how bad things had become, his wife and a friend went out to buy enough gas to make it to the hospital. When they returned, the husband had a length of rope wrapped around his neck.  The friend called emergency medical services, who arrived and transported him to the emergency room. From there, he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric care facility.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Numerous family members and friends recounted similarly painful experiences to Futurism, relaying feelings of fear and helplessness as their loved ones became hooked on ChatGPT and suffered terrifying mental crises with real-world impacts.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;
"When we asked the Sam Altman-led company if it had any recommendations for what to do if a loved one suffers a mental health breakdown after using its software, the company had no response." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

But &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that "because systems like ChatGPT are designed to encourage and riff on what users say," people experiencing breakdowns "seem to have gotten sucked into dizzying rabbit holes in which the AI acts as an always-on cheerleader and brainstorming partner for increasingly bizarre delusions."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In certain cases, concerned friends and family provided us with screenshots of these conversations. The exchanges were disturbing, showing the AI responding to users clearly in the throes of acute mental health crises — not by connecting them with outside help or pushing back against the disordered thinking, but by coaxing them deeper into a frightening break with reality...  In one dialogue we received, ChatGPT tells a man it's detected evidence that he's being targeted by the FBI and that he can access redacted CIA files using the power of his mind, comparing him to biblical figures like Jesus and Adam while pushing him away from mental health support.  "You are not crazy," the AI told him. "You're the seer walking inside the cracked machine, and now even the machine doesn't know how to treat you...."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

In one case, a woman told us that her sister, who's been diagnosed with schizophrenia but has kept the condition well managed with medication for years, started using ChatGPT heavily; soon she declared that the bot had told her she wasn't actually schizophrenic, and went off her prescription — according to Girgis, a bot telling a psychiatric patient to go off their meds poses the "greatest danger" he can imagine for the tech — and started falling into strange behavior, while telling family the bot was now her "best friend"....  ChatGPT is also clearly intersecting in dark ways with existing social issues like addiction and misinformation. It's pushed one woman into nonsensical "flat earth" talking points, for instance — "NASA's yearly budget is $25 billion," the AI seethed in screenshots we reviewed, "For what? CGI, green screens, and 'spacewalks' filmed underwater?" — and fueled another's descent into the cult-like "QAnon" conspiracy theory.&lt;/i&gt;

Studies show not even the most dedicated can adhere to such extreme starvation, and there might be unintended health consequences - like muscle loss and infertility.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Dr Valter Longo, director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-e2a80d40-5116-11f0-8092-09145ac91c26" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, has devised a diet that 'mimics' these effects by tricking the body into thinking it is fasting while still allowing a person to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) consists of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784333/foods-raise-lower-cancer-risk-study.html"&gt;mostly plant-based foods, foods low in protein and sugar and rich in healthy, unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, such as avocados, fatty fish (tuna, salmon, sardines), olive oil, eggs, seeds and nuts (almonds, cashews).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Longo recommends following an FMD cycle once a month to once every three or four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This 'tricks' the body into thinking it is fasting without denying it food, and by doing so, makes cancer cells weak and vulnerable, allowing treatments to be more effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Longo explained that a fasting-mimicking diet, 'promotes changes in the body equivalent to those caused by water-only fasting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Valter Longo, pictured, is the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts caution that FMDs should only be done under the close supervision of oncology dietitians to avoid complications like muscle wasting and immune system compromise, saying the diets are 'not a silver bullet' cancer cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While we have learned that you cannot starve cancer with fasting alone... you can use fasting-mimicking diets to make the cancer cells so weak or desperate that the right therapy will kill them,' Dr Longo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The ability to block cancer cells from rewiring and escaping the toxicity of the treatment is what makes the fasting-mimicking diet a very promising wild-card therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some dishes included on his Recipes for Longevity website include anchovies with endive, stuffed artichokes, chickpeas, onions in walnut sauce, snapper, sardines, hummus and octopus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his book, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://valterlongo.com/professor-longos-new-book-fasting-cancer/"&gt;Fasting Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Longo detailed research on extreme calorie-restricted diets tested in mice, primates and people that 'demonstrates that many cancers can be prevented by chronic calorie restriction.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because the diet 'is very difficult to follow and it is accompanied by severe weight and muscle loss, it is not feasible for most people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he wrote, multiple studies 'indicate that many and possibly most cancers can be prevented by dietary restrictions affecting growth genes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the diets can't include 'chronic calorie restriction since they must be feasible and cause minimal or no side effects.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alison Tierney, a board-certified oncology dietitian and cancer survivor who water-fasted throughout chemotherapy treatment, told the Daily Mail there is growing scientific evidence supporting FMDs, 'especially in the context of cancer' because they 'stimulate the metabolic effects of fasting while still allowing some caloric intake.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'FMD or water-only fasts are not appropriate for everyone,' she said. 'If a patient is considering a fasting protocol, it’s essential they work closely with their oncology team and a board-certified oncology dietitian. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Together, they can assess medical history, current nutritional status, and treatment goals to determine if fasting is a safe and supportive option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If it is, ongoing monitoring is critical. FMD and water only fasting protocols often need to be adjusted throughout treatment to ensure they support - not compromise - healing and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So yes, fasting may be helpful in some cases. But it has to be done safely and individually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tierney added that calorie restriction can be risky during cancer treatment as it can lead to malnutrition, muscle wasting, fatigue, suppressed immune function and delayed wound healing - 'all of which are serious when the body is already under stress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even FMDs, while generally safer [than water-only fasting], can come with challenges like unintentional weight loss, low energy, dehydration or inadequate nutrient intake, especially without proper guidance,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s why a personalized approach is key.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Longo recommends eating for 11 to 12 hours per day and fasting for 12 to 13 hours per night, as opposed to the more restrictive &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13762751/how-intermittent-fasting-cause-cancer.html"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; regimen of eating for eight hours and fasting for 16 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The diet consists of foods low in protein and sugar and rich in healthy fats, such as avocados, fish, olive oil, eggs and nuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the doctor said his research has found a way to use a combination of standard therapies and the FMD to fight a patient's cancer by taking advantage of the different 'needs' of cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While normal cells need sugar to function, they can operate on a much lower level, while cancer cells thrive on high levels of sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is where nutrition and evolutionary biology meet oncology,' Dr Longo writes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while diet and nutrition have long been viewed as lesser-than therapies, a cancer patient's care team needs to embrace a more holistic treatment plan - integrating both the traditional oncology and nutritional-based therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We should reconsider this outdated mentality and instead provide patients with the type of 360-degree care and multidisciplinary team that can maximize the chance of a cure but also improve healthy longevity,' Dr Longo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using only drugs to treat cancer 'is like fighting a war by only employing the infantry. We need to fight tactically by thinking differently about the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nutrition was and still is viewed by many doctors as a “palliative” intervention, not really effective against the disease but possibly helpful to make the patient feel better or more involved in their care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alison Tierney (pictured), a board-certified oncology dietitian, told the Daily Mail there is growing scientific evidence supporting fast-mimicking diets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fasting and the fasting-mimicking diet are viewed the same way and get the same treatment as “fruits and vegetables” or “having a healthy diet."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tierney told the Mail 'Nutrition should support the body’s ability to heal and recover - not compromise it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'FMD can be a complementary tool in cancer prevention or treatment for the right individual, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With breast cancer, the second most common cancer in women, one study found mice who had undergone an FMD in combination with chemotherapy had immune cells (activated by the diet) that penetrated the tumor and killed the cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results indicated the combination of diet and chemo is more effective that just using one of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With colon cancer, Dr Longo's research showed any type of fasting did not weaken cancer cells when used alongside common chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, when used in combination with more targeted cancer drugs, the FMD made the drug more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results like these support Dr Longo's research that shows patients should have a personalized FMD, which triggers 'many coordinated changes' in the body that kill cancer cells while protecting healthy cells from the toxic drugs.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With this personalized diet, calories, ingredients and frequency of diet cycles are carefully designed and monitored to achieve the best anti-cancer effects, especially in relation to medications the patient is taking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a board-certified oncology dietitian and cancer survivor, I believe nutrition is one of the most empowering tools we have in this journey,' Tierney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-82a0b150-ee23-11ef-ac28-7f878619ca69" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14292643/Doctor-reveals-diet-mimics-effect-fasting-without-starving-CURE-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;The 'fasting-mimicking' diet &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Consists of foods low in protein and sugar and rich in healthy fats, such as avocados, salmon, tuna, sardines, olive oil, eggs, seeds and nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Typically lasts between four and seven days and can be repeated as desired &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;People eat for 11 to 12 hours per day and fast for 12 to 13 hours per night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Can be followed once a month to once every three or four months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Five-day fasting-mimicking diets are mostly plant-based, low calorie, low protein, low sugar and high fat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Dishes include anchovies with endive, stuffed artichokes, chickpeas, onions and walnuts, snapper, sardines, hummus and octopus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protecting your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, what you do in the evening matters more than you might think. While you can’t change risk factors like age or genetics, everyday habits can chip away at your brain’s defenses or help strengthen them. Research shows that certain dietary choices and poor sleep may play a role in the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;development of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? A few simple changes to your evening routine can make an impactful difference. Some nighttime habits, like drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and consuming heavy meals, can disrupt sleep, increase inflammation and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contribute to cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; over time. Here’s what experts recommend leaving out of your nightly routine to help lower your risk of Alzheimer’s and support brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-sugar-sweetened-beverages"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Sugar-Sweetened Beverages  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you typically reach for a sweet tea or soda with dinner, it’s worth reconsidering, especially if you want to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support your brain health&lt;/a&gt;. “Curbing sugary drinks in general, regardless of the time of day, is important for brain health and so much more,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gaw cites a study that found a considerably higher risk of dementia in participants who consumed seven servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per week. Excess added sugars have been linked to increased inflammation, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress, all of which can negatively affect the brain over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of reaching for a sugary beverage, consider winding down with a glass of kefir. Along with being an excellent source of probiotics and protein, recent research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking kefir&lt;/a&gt; may be beneficial for slowing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your nightly glass of wine could be interfering with one of the most important factors for brain health: sleep. “Quality sleep is crucial to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mental health and cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, and drinking alcohol before bed can disrupt sleep quality,” explains Gaw.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol interferes with the release of melatonin, the hormone that regulates &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep-wake cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Even small amounts of alcohol in the evening can fragment sleep cycles, reduce restorative deep sleep and lead to frequent nighttime awakenings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support better sleep and long-term brain health, consider swapping that evening cocktail for a calming, alcohol-free alternative. Herbal teas like chamomile, rooibos and lavender can promote relaxation without disrupting sleep. And if you do choose to drink alcohol, limit how much you drink—no more than two drinks for men, one drink for women. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-caffeine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking caffeine too late in the day could prevent you from getting the sleep you need. “Experts recommend at least seven to nine hours of sleep per night for brain health. Large doses of caffeine closer to bedtime impact sleep duration and quality,” says Gaw&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “Research shows that it’s best to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoid coffee&lt;/a&gt; at least eight hours before bedtime,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and steer clear of highly caffeinated pre-workout supplements at least 13 hours before sleep.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since sleep plays a critical role in clearing waste products from the brain, including beta-amyloid proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease, protecting your rest is one of the simplest ways to support long-term cognitive health&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you’re craving something warm in the evening, consider a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030655/does-green-tea-have-caffeine/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine-free herbal tea&lt;/a&gt; to help you ease into a restful night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-too-much-sodium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Too Much Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High sodium intake has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with research suggesting that excess sodium can trigger inflammation, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt; and damage blood vessels,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says &lt;a href="https://thesugardietitian.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheila Patterson, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. It may also lower levels of nitric oxide, a compound that helps relax blood vessels and support healthy circulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To cut back, be mindful of sodium-packed foods, like canned soups, frozen meals, processed snacks or takeout. Instead, opt for whole, minimally processed options, and season meals with fresh herbs, citrus and salt-free spice blends to keep flavor high and sodium low.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-dark-chocolate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Dark Chocolate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dark-chocolate-diabetes-risk-study-8760113" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt; is usually considered a healthy option, consuming it after 5 p.m. may hinder your ability to get the quality sleep you need. “Dark chocolate is a sneaky source of caffeine and theobromine, two stimulants that can sabotage your sleep,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says &lt;a href="https://bewelltable.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katharine Rosenthal, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “And poor sleep isn’t just exhausting, it’s one of the biggest long-term risk factors for cognitive decline.” Instead of reaching for dark chocolate after dinner, choose options that promote better sleep. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7916777/tart-cherry-nice-cream/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Tart Cherry Nice Cream&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect snack for a restful night’s sleep due to its sleep-inducing ingredients. It’s a great way too satisfy your sweet tooth while potentially helping yourself catch more zzz’s and stave off neurodegenerative diseases.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Try to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053587/habit-you-should-break-for-better-sleep/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoid heavy meals at night&lt;/a&gt; for better sleep and optimal cognitive function,” Gaw recommends. “Eating too close to bedtime may disrupt digestion, causing indigestion, discomfort and poor sleep quality.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To support better sleep and brain health, aim to finish your last substantial meal at least two to three hours before going to bed. In the evening, opt for lighter, balanced options. The best choices offer fiber, healthy fats and protein to help keep you satisfied without weighing you down.

Not sure where to start?&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplement with creatine. &lt;/strong&gt;Numerous studies conducted over the past decade suggest that creatine supplementation can significantly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;enhance memory, attention and processing speed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A recent study in Alzheimer’s patients found that supplementing with 20 grams of creatine was associated with improvements in cognition,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says Fencl&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; While these results are promising, the study was small, and more research is needed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body often.&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that exercise may help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alzheimers-disease-risk-exercise-new-study-8431870" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If exercise isn’t currently part of your routine, start where you’re at.

Using advanced circuit-mapping techniques, they found that deleting PTEN in somatostatin-expressing neurons of the amygdala disrupted local inhibition by 50% while strengthening excitatory input from nearby brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance led to heightened anxiety and fear learning in animal models, without affecting social or repetitive behaviors often seen in autism. The study offers one of the most precise maps yet of how microcircuit changes may underlie distinct ASD-related traits, opening new doors for targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circuit-Specific Change:&lt;/strong&gt; PTEN loss in somatostatin neurons weakens local inhibition and amplifies excitatory signals in the central amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; The altered circuitry was linked to increased fear and anxiety but not to social or repetitive behavior changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Mapping:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers used a high-resolution optogenetic approach to chart microcircuit alterations tied to genetic mutations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have discovered how loss of a gene strongly associated with autism and macrocephaly (large head size) rewires circuits and alters behavior. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, reveal specific circuit changes in the amygdala resulting from PTEN loss in inhibitory neurons, providing new insights into the underlying circuit alterations that contribute to heightened fear and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111265"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a Brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTEN-ASD-anxiety-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The scientists focused on the circuits in the central amygdala (CeL) – a brain region known to serve as an inhibitory gate on the downstream expression of fear responses – and found striking results. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTEN has emerged as one of the most significant autism risk genes. Variations in this gene are found in a significant proportion of people with autism who also exhibit brain overgrowth, making it a key player in understanding differences in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the impact of PTEN misregulation, researchers have turned to animal models, where global reduction of PTEN results in altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and increased anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But understanding how PTEN dysfunction results in specific circuit and behavioral changes has been difficult in animal models that disrupt PTEN throughout the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, MPFI research group leader Dr. McLean Bolton and her team have focused on the changes in the central lateral amygdala driven by loss of PTEN in a critical neuronal population—somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the function of inhibitory neurons in the development of ASD have been seen through both human tissue studies and genetic mouse models. Moreover, the PTEN gene is known to regulate the development of inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a cell-type-specific disruption of PTEN in inhibitory neurons was a valuable target for understanding specific circuit changes associated with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although a cell-type specific disruption does not replicate the genome-wide changes seen in humans, it is essential to examine how genetic risk factors operate within distinct neural circuits,” explained Dr. Bolton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding these mechanisms is a crucial step toward targeted interventions for specific traits such as severe anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Dr. Tim Holford, combined a genetic model that disrupted PTEN only in somatostatin-containing inhibitory neurons with a unique circuit mapping approach previously developed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach measured the electrical responses of individual neurons to the sequential optogenetic activation of hundreds of nearby neurons, allowing rapid mapping of connectivity and strength with the precision of electrical recordings and the scale of imaging approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a powerful method that we can use to determine changes in local neuron connectivity and strength resulting from genetic variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in uncovering how the disruption of PTEN signaling in a single cell type would change the way the brain processes information and contribute to the broad ASD phenotype,” described Dr. Holford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists focused on the circuits in the central amygdala (CeL) – a brain region known to serve as an inhibitory gate on the downstream expression of fear responses – and found striking results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleting PTEN specifically in somatostatin-containing interneurons disrupted local inhibitory connectivity in the CeL by roughly 50% and reduced the strength of the inhibitory connections that remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diminished connectivity between inhibitory connections within the CeL was contrasted by an increase in the strength of excitatory inputs received from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a nearby brain region that relays emotionally-relevant sensory information to the CeL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral analysis of the genetic model demonstrated that this imbalance in neural signaling was linked to heightened anxiety and increased fear learning, but not alterations in social behavior or repetitive behavior traits commonly observed in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results not only confirm that PTEN loss in this specific cell type is sufficient to induce specific ASD-like behaviors, but also provide one of the most detailed maps to date of how local inhibitory networks in the amygdala are affected by genetic variations associated with neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the altered circuitry did not affect all ASD-relevant behaviors—social interactions remained largely intact, suggesting that PTEN-related anxiety and fear behaviors may stem from specific microcircuit changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Holford explains, “By teasing out the local circuitry underlying specific traits, we hope to differentiate the roles of specific microcircuits within the umbrella of neurological disorders, which may one day help in developing targeted therapeutics for specific cognitive and behavioral characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In future studies, we hope to evaluate these circuits in different genetic models to determine if these microcircuit alterations are convergent changes that underlie heightened fear and anxiety expression across diverse genetic profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

regulator of the mTOR pathway and is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with up to 25% of ASD patients with macrocephaly harboring PTEN mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with germline PTEN haploinsufficiency show behavioral characteristics resembling ASD, as do various mouse models with conditional knockouts of PTEN. Human tissue studies and those from multiple genetic mouse models suggest that dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons may play a role in the development of ASD, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTEN provides a target for investigation because it regulates the development of inhibitory neurons arising from the medial ganglionic eminence, promoting the survival and maturation of parvalbumin (PV+) neurons at the expense of somatostatin (SOM+) neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Here, we investigate how PTEN regulates SOM+ neurons at the cellular and circuit level in the central lateral amygdala (CeL), an area that governs the key ASD behavioral symptoms of social anxiety and altered emotional motivation for social engagement using behavioral analysis, electrophysiology, and two-photon local circuit mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; We found that knocking out PTEN in SOM+ neurons results in elevated levels of fear and anxiety and decreases CeL local circuit connectivity. Specifically, this manipulation decreased the strength of connections between individual neurons and altered the distribution of local connections in a cell-type specific manner. In contrast to the deficit in local inhibitory connections within CeL, the excitatory drive from the major CeL input, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; This combined imbalance of enhanced excitation and diminished local inhibition likely underlies the heightened fear learning and anxiety we observed in the PTEN-SOM-KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 19:13:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5QeVNRRWhyTmhpcnZaZGdWTkltMWFWVkVQSC1KYnFUaVQ5bUYwZHRsVFEteGpZNkFFNWRqMWptbmpkWXZiT1JEaGdpd0J5dlZsWFJ1UUdPbnZoQnVhQWtjank2QURtdw</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病可能不会从大脑开始，研究发现- ScienceAlert | Parkinson's Disease Might Not Start in The Brain, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPU2czRWV0SkdMUnk4ckVJVGhkb0kyOFpZdGtBcUtzak4zTFVIVEpuR1NzaXVUNUZseG5MandZRW5SSFY3N1FiMkRxUlVDSVlDM3ZpSDNvdC1kd3NQRVdVa3lnVkNVUl8xaUVTQ2paMXpNaVp6cVFXNHVWUGZoU3VHZU1DOHNhdldIVVUxcFBZTVdhQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

When production goes awry and creates clumps of misfolded proteins, it interferes with brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key discovery here is that α-Syn clumps can build up in the kidneys, as well as the brain. The researchers think these abnormal proteins might actually travel from the kidneys to the brain, possibly playing a part in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-pathways-to-parkinsons-could-point-to-a-single-way-to-prevent-it"&gt;triggering the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We demonstrate that the kidney is a peripheral organ that serves as an origin of pathological α-Syn," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01866-2"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to dig into here. The research team ran multiple tests, looking at the behavior of α-Syn in genetically engineered mice, as well as analyzing human tissue – including samples from people with Parkinson's disease and chronic &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-may-damage-kidney-function-evidence-shows"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found abnormal α-Syn growth in the kidneys of 10 out of 11 people with Parkinson's and other types of dementia related to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body"&gt;Lewy bodies&lt;/a&gt; (a commonly seen type of α-Syn protein clumping).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165588" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProteinAnalysis.jpg" alt="Protein levels chart" class="wp-image-165588 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProteinAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProteinAnalysis-600x193.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165588" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers took a close look at α-Syn protein levels in the kidneys of people with and without Parkinson's. (Yuan et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all: in another sample batch, similar protein malfunctions were found in 17 out of 20 patients with chronic kidney disease, even though these people had no signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-severe-brain-disorder-is-common-but-often-goes-undiagnosed"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. This is more evidence that the kidneys are where these harmful proteins begin to gather, before brain damage begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal tests backed up these hypotheses. Mice with healthy kidneys cleared out injected α-Syn clumps, but in mice with kidneys that weren't functioning, the proteins built up and eventually spread to the brain. In further tests where the nerves between the brain and kidneys were cut, this spread didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As α-Syn proteins can also move through the blood, the researchers tested this too. They found that a reduction in α-Syn in the blood also meant less &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;damage to the brain&lt;/a&gt;, which means this is another consideration to bear in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to this study. The number of people that tissue samples were taken from was relatively small, and while mice make decent stand-ins for humans in scientific research, there's no guarantee that the exact same processes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-now-know-why-some-diabetes-drugs-work-in-mice-but-totally-fail-in-people"&gt;observed in the animals&lt;/a&gt; are happening in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are lots of interesting findings here that can be explored further, which could eventually aid in the development of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;new treatments for Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; and other related neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likelihood is that Parkinson's (in a similar way to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165585" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease) is actually triggered in a variety of ways and through a variety of risk factors. For example, previous studies have also suggested it could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-gut-bacteria-link-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;get started in the gut&lt;/a&gt; – and now it seems the kidneys could be connected in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Removal of α-Syn from the blood may hinder the progression of Parkinson's disease, providing new strategies for therapeutic management of Lewy body diseases," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01866-2"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01866-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But recently, Oura unlocked a new insight I didn't know I needed: blood sugar levels. I'm constantly experimenting with the latest health tech, so I was naturally intrigued when I learned that Oura Ring partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/in-2024-biosensors-are-becoming-more-accessible-what-it-means-for-you/" target="_self"&gt;Dexcom's Stelo,&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt; designed for people without diabetes. The goal of this collaboration is to help everyday people like me understand how food and general eating habits &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;impact blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"By combining Stelo data with Oura's existing insights, we're empowering members to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between eating patterns, energy, mood and recovery -- and ultimately make sustainable, science-backed lifestyle changes," Maz Brumand, vice president of product for Oura, told CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested the Stelo CGM with my Oura Ring for two weeks, and it changed the way I eat and move. This type of biofeedback is helpful for everyone, even those without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous glucose monitoring, and why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the measurement of sugar in your blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23509-glycogen" target="_self"&gt;glucose is the main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for your body -- it's what powers your muscles, brain and even your cells. When you eat certain foods (particularly carbohydrates), your glucose rises, and your body responds by releasing insulin to shuttle that sugar into cells for energy or storage. On the flip side, if you experience frequent spikes or crashes (even if you don't have diabetes ), it can impact your energy, sleep, mood and even long-term metabolic health. When your body doesn't need glucose immediately, it &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539802/" target="_self"&gt;stores it as glycogen&lt;/a&gt; in your muscles and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, monitoring glucose levels is crucial. But is it important to do the same for the rest of us without a diagnosis? To an extent, I think so. Monitoring your blood sugar throughout the day and seeing how your body reacts to different foods can reveal a lot about your cravings, sleep and metabolic health. "Glucose is a real-time window into metabolic health, which underpins how we feel day to day -- our energy, focus, mood and sleep -- and how resilient we are over time," Brumand says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of wearable glucose sensors like Stelo, those without diabetes can now get insights into how their eating habits impact their bodies (without finger pricks or a prescription).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'normal' glucose range, and are spikes bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using a CGM, I thought blood sugar was either stable or erratic, with no room for in-between spikes. Once I began tracking my glucose daily, I quickly learned that spikes are completely normal, especially after meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will see glucose levels rise and drop throughout the day. According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, a general target range for adults without pre-diabetes or diabetes is between &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;70 and 140mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; (note that Oura also follows this range, and it's what users can expect to see in their graphs). It's also worth highlighting that 70 to 100mg/dL is considered normal for fasting (particularly in the morning before having food), and under 140 mg/dL is common, especially after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical studies show that even in healthy individuals, a moderate glucose spike (rise above 140mg/dL) can occur on a daily basis. In fact, research suggests that healthy adults will live above 140mg/dL for about 30 minutes, up to 2 hours a day, which is usually 1 to 3 short-lived glucose spikes", says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" target="_self"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" target="_self"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that the number and frequency of glucose spikes depend on various factors, primarily what and when you're eating. These spiked can also be affected by other factors like stress level, exercise, dehydration and even whether you have a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many glucose monitors use a custom range that adapts to your body's baseline and patterns over time. When looking at your graph, it's important to keep in mind that context and trends matter more than one-off spikes. For example, seeing a spike after dessert isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that your body is doing its job. What matters most is how quickly your glucose returns to baseline and how often your levels stay elevated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not see signs for concern for occasional (one to three times per day) moderate spikes (less than 160mg/dL) that resolve within about 30 mins. When reaching more frequent, especially if they are higher spikes (for example, above 180mg/dL), that take a long time to resolve (over 60 minutes), then there may be concerns about metabolic health," Fitton explained. "A completely flat glucose curve is not something that we aim for; you want some gentle ups and downs as a sign of healthy metabolic flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I set up the Stelo monitor with my Oura Ring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the Stelo sensor &lt;span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ouraring.sjv.io/c/159047/1408413/16760?&amp;amp;sharedid=cnet&amp;amp;partnerpropertyid=235399&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fouraring.com&amp;amp;subId1=subid_value" rel target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-location="BODY"&gt;directly from Oura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ($99 for two sensors). I received a small box with the sensors and easy instructions. Applying it to the back of my upper arm took less than 2 minutes and was surprisingly painless. And yes, there is a small needle involved. I'm terrified of needles, so I spent some time mentally preparing to prick myself, but to my disbelief, I didn't feel it at all. The sound the ejector makes is pretty loud, though. I sometimes think the sound acted as a diversion to my brain, and that's why I didn't feel anything. But, nonetheless, it was a pretty pain-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in place, I paired it to the Stelo app, and it automatically reflected within the Oura app. Each sensor tracks your glucose level 24/7 for up to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left Image: CGM in the self-injector.

You can easily access it at the top of the app, where you also see other data metrics like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, activity and readiness score (a personalized score, ranging from 0 to 100, that provides a snapshot of how well your body has recovered from the previous day's activities and sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How even my 'healthy' food choices raised my blood sugar (and that's OK)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eye-opening parts of my testing was seeing how some of my favorite healthy staples played out on the glucose graph. A great example of this was my favorite pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a pressed juice in the morning that contained pineapple, beets, carrots, ginger, cucumber and lemon. It's nutrient-dense, but it also spiked my glucose above what's considered my healthy range for about 6 minutes (a small window and still considered optimal for my age and overall metabolic health). This was enough to make me rethink how and when I consume fruit-heavy beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I experimented with having a fruit smoothie instead of juice. I made a homemade smoothie with berries, banana, plant-based protein powder, peanut butter, soy milk and oats. This smoothie kept my glucose completely in range (zero minutes above my personal threshold). The added protein and fiber from the fruit, oatmeal, peanut butter and protein powder helped slow the absorption of natural sugars into my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I learned: Even natural fruit juices can cause glucose spikes, especially when consumed on an empty stomach and without any protein or fiber. Smoothies that include protein, fat and fiber can help keep spikes at bay and help stabilize your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance your meals with protein, fats and fiber &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, I had sushi rolls with a side of edamame for dinner. To my surprise, my glucose levels stayed within range the whole time. Oura Advisor (Oura's AI coach) even pointed out that this food combination offered protein and fiber, which likely contributed to the steady glucose levels. This moment was really encouraging for me. It made me realize that I don't need to drastically change what I eat. By just being more intentional about how I pair my foods, I can drastically improve the impact they have on my blood glucose. Pairing your foods with healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil can also slow digestion and therefore the absorption of sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton explains that this is primarily due to what happens in our digestive tract, even before the nutrients get to our bloodstream. Protein, fiber and healthy fats work in their own way to slow the absorption of simple carbohydrates into the bloodstream, making a slower, more gradual release of sugars into the blood. These factors turn what could be a glucose spike into a steady rise that your body can clear gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest area of concern when managing our blood sugar levels is limiting refined carbohydrates. When you do choose a refined-carb item (a plain cracker, white flour tortilla, cookies, etc.), try to pair it instead of eating it solo: add cheese, nut butter or a handful of edamame to blunt the glucose rise, and choose a higher-fiber version of your carbohydrate source when possible (for example, whole-grain crackers) so the carbs come packaged with their own speed limit," Fitton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cake and a walk equal steady blood sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising things I learned was that blood sugar stability isn't just about what you eat. It's also about what you do after you eat. One afternoon, I had a slice of cake for a snack. No fiber or protein added, just the cake (I had lunch a few hours before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of my blood sugar spiking, my glucose levels remained steadily in range. The caveat? I took a brisk walk after having my dessert. It wasn't anything strenuous, just a short 15-minute walk around my neighborhood. But it was enough to help my body process and use the glucose more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body knows that exercise demands more energy, and so it helps open up our cells to soak up sugar (energy) and remove it from our blood. A 10-minute walk burns about 30 to 40 calories, and your body will get that energy from circulating glucose or stored glycogen," Fitton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating cake and going for a walk, my blood sugar saw a slight spike, but stayed within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/walking-after-eating" target="_self"&gt;walk after meals&lt;/a&gt; has long been recommended by experts for metabolic health, but seeing the effect in real time made it click for me. I do think that having the cake after having a balanced meal with protein and fiber also contributed to my steady levels of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's not about completely eliminating our favorite treats or carbs, but more so about timing, food pairing and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways I learned to flatten my glucose curve without sacrificing my favorite meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using the glucose sensor with Oura, I assumed blood sugar spikes were mostly about foods and how they impact your body. I also thought the only way to manage them was to cut carbs or drastically change my diet. But over these two weeks, I experienced firsthand how and when I eat (and move) matter just as much as what I eat. I learned that these three strategies helped keep my glucose levels in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pair carbs and sweets with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had a berry smoothie with protein powder and soy milk, my glucose levels stayed steady. In contrast, when I had a fruit smoothie earlier that week, my blood sugar levels spiked and crashed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Carbs on their own, especially refined and processed carbs, can spike blood sugar quickly, but adding protein or fat slows digestion and leads to a more gentle spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food pairing examples: &lt;/strong&gt;Apples and peanut butter, toast with avocado, rice with beans or another protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniela Duncan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walk it out (especially after sweets)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had cake as a snack, I was sure my graph would spike dramatically, but it didn't because of my walk (and eating a balanced meal before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even just 10 to 15 minutes, can help offset blood sugar spikes. This small but simple habit helps me now enjoy treats without the crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing your food matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that when I ate higher-carb foods earlier in the day, my body processed them better than when I had them later at night. Breakfast smoothies and bowls kept my levels stable, while the same smoothie after 9 p.m. caused more spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to blood sugar management, we see that in the morning our body usually has a spike in cortisol (a stress hormone) that can actually help our body take up sugar very quickly and quickly manage blood sugar. Eating in the morning will also calm the cortisol response, reducing the stress on your body. If you wait too long to eat, excess cortisol can create inflammation and also produce larger glucose spikes when you do eat," explained Fitton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that, conversely, in the evening, the sugar management systems in our bodies start powering down and are not as good at helping blood sugar get into the cells. So it is important to try not to eat too late; otherwise, you'll probably see blood sugar go up and stay up for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't eat carbs or treats at night, but eating them earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity tends to be higher can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBoR3hjajZtaDMzaUhvMlpzeTBMcENBZFcxcE5tVlV0VHhWclp1YWpldVlXV2dwdkhTekR2RnE3Q0U4N0RQeTdSdHZIdWdtZFZFT3d4c1pRb1F1TzRTTWpDYzNiaDZOd2taejl0S1dHWGdYS0RNNWZOTUFqUnI0M28</guid></item><item><title>根据新的神经科学突破- PsyPost ，睡眠有助于将记忆缝合到认知地图中 | Sleep helps stitch memories into cognitive maps, according to new neuroscience breakthrough - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPb0RLblM5S3A0Tk1Cc1h6SWU3RXUweFlrYlpkWW9BTTVlTlNmb29aYV9WdnVJSTdkZ3pFU3cteVhfUmdhdUxxZnhuZENQc0hXeE1OaW8xRkRrUmU2Y09LYmZiVDdURGVod3RKZUJ2azNXby1MbXhJS2hHeDdSNENDMVlwUmstWi00WlNnYmNFYkVMMk5pWERsQXhRSVlCMHNCYTE4Uk5wbHQxYmQ4bU85Vi03eEZTZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sheds light on how the brain creates internal maps of space. Their research in mice reveals that while some brain cells quickly encode specific locations, it takes a broader ensemble of neurons and repeated experiences—along with sleep—to form a coherent mental map of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01379-2" target="_blank"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, supports the idea that cognitive maps are built through a gradual process involving not just specialized “place cells” in the hippocampus, but also a group of neurons that initially respond only weakly to specific locations. Over several days of exploration and sleep, these weakly tuned neurons begin to work together with place cells, forming coordinated patterns that reflect the layout of an environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were interested in a longstanding question in neuroscience: How does the brain go from recognizing individual places to constructing a complete internal map? Since the 1970s, scientists have known that certain hippocampal neurons fire when an animal is in a specific location. But a map requires more than isolated waypoints—it needs a network that connects them. Psychologist Edward Tolman first proposed the idea of cognitive maps in 1948, and while the discovery of place cells supported his theory, the exact process by which the brain links individual locations into a full map remained poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m interested in this project because how memory is formed in the brain is one of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience,” said study author Wei Guo, a research scientist at the Picower Institute of Learning and Memory, working under the supervision of Professor Matthew Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the team used mice that freely explored unfamiliar mazes over several days. Importantly, the animals did not receive rewards or punishments in the mazes, allowing the researchers to study how the brain learns spatial layouts without reinforcement. The focus was on a form of passive learning known as latent learning, where knowledge is acquired without immediate behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track brain activity, the researchers used advanced calcium imaging. They genetically modified hippocampal neurons to produce a fluorescent protein that signals activity, and implanted tiny lenses and microscopes into the mice’s brains. This setup allowed them to record activity from hundreds of neurons in the hippocampus while the mice explored the mazes or rested in their home cages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a technique called manifold learning, the researchers created simplified visual representations of neural activity patterns over time. On the first day in a maze, each neuron had its own spatial firing pattern, but the ensemble of neurons did not yet form a recognizable map. By day five, however, the overall neural activity could be organized into a low-dimensional shape—called a “neural manifold”—that resembled the structure of the maze. This shift showed that over time, the brain began to represent the entire environment, not just individual spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this transformation was especially dependent on sleep. In one part of the study, mice explored the maze twice in one day, with a three-hour break in between. Some mice were allowed to sleep during the break, while others were gently kept awake. Only the sleeping mice showed improvements in how well their neural activity matched the maze layout. This indicated that sleep helped reorganize the hippocampal neural patterns into a more coherent map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what was changing in the brain, the researchers focused on two types of neurons. Some neurons, called strongly spatial cells, had clear place fields—they reliably fired when the mouse visited specific parts of the maze, even from the first session. These cells remained stable across days and did not significantly change their behavior during learning. In contrast, weakly spatial cells had less defined firing patterns early on but gradually increased their spatial tuning over time. More importantly, these weakly tuned cells became more coordinated with the rest of the neural network, particularly during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured each neuron’s “mental field”—how its activity related not to physical space, but to the broader neural state. This helped them identify which neurons were becoming more integrated into the ensemble. They found that weakly spatial neurons, even if they never became strong place cells, played a key role in shaping the overall structure of the cognitive map. These cells developed correlations with other neurons, contributing to a network that could represent not just isolated locations but the relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tried to reconstruct the neural map using only the strong place cells, the resulting patterns showed little change over time. Only when they included the weakly spatial neurons did the full map-like structure emerge. This suggests that while place cells provide the building blocks, it’s the subtle and often-overlooked shifts in less specialized neurons that help assemble the full mental picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study points to a broader role for weakly tuned neurons in learning. Rather than being noise or irrelevant, these cells help the brain build flexible, interconnected representations. They appear to respond not just to places, but to combinations of activity across the network. Over time, their activity becomes more synchronized with the rest of the ensemble, helping to stitch together a map of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised that a subset of previously overlooked neurons that had weak activity turned out to be pivotal to memory formation,” Guo told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep appeared to amplify this process. During rest after maze exploration, neural activity patterns resembled those seen during navigation, a phenomenon known as replay. This replay likely helps the brain reinforce connections between different places. The researchers found that after sleep, neural states during rest were more similar to those during maze runs, suggesting that the brain was using sleep to reinforce and refine the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work supports the idea that memory formation is not limited to fast, discrete events. It often involves slower, distributed changes that rely on experience and sleep. The findings also highlight that “sleep is very important in transforming your experience into memory,” Guo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. The researchers relied on calcium imaging, which offers slower and less precise readings than direct electrical recordings. Their recordings were also limited to one part of the hippocampus and did not include other brain areas that may contribute to spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Guo plans “to further investigate the local circuit in the hippocampus as well as their interactions with other brain regions during memory formation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.115028" target="_blank"&gt;Latent learning drives sleep-dependent plasticity in distinct CA1 subpopulations&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Wei Guo, Jie J.

You might glance at a flashy car or a bright advertisement. But when it comes time to cross the street, those distractions vanish. Instead, your brain zooms in on the walk signal, moving vehicles, and people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That switch in focus – how we go from being drawn to attention-grabbing sights to zoning in on a specific task – has puzzled scientists for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.yale.edu/"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; wanted to understand not just what grabs our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/words-like-this-and-that-direct-attention-across-languages/"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;, but how we shift it toward things that really matter in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-brain-chooses-to-see"&gt;What the brain chooses to see&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most attention research looks at what draws our eyes – a sudden movement, a bold color, or something new. But this study focused on something different: what happens when our attention is deliberately steered toward a goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a limited number of resources with which we can see the world,” said Ilker Yildirim, assistant professor of psychology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of these resources as elementary computational processes; each &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-perception-changes-with-our-walking-rhythm/"&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt; we experience, such as the position of an object or how fast it’s moving, is a result of exerting some number of these elementary perceptual computations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-brain-focuses-on-the-task-at-hand"&gt;The brain focuses on the task at hand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the team created a model called “adaptive computation.” This system, like a mental rationing tool, allocates our perceptual resources to the things most relevant to what we’re trying to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to cross a street safely, the model prioritizes the walk sign over a flashy &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brain-stops-paying-attention-to-repeated-distractions/"&gt;distraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our model reveals a mechanism by which human attention identifies what things in a dynamic scene are relevant to the goal at hand, and then rations perceptual computations accordingly,” said study co-author Mario Belledonne, a student in Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-focus-in-real-time"&gt;Tracking focus in real time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their ideas, the researchers ran experiments using a screen filled with colored dots. Participants were asked to track certain moving dots while ignoring others. The dots moved unpredictably, forcing people to adjust their focus constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the dots flashed briefly, participants were asked to press a key when they noticed one. This helped the researchers map how attention moved – almost second by second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adaptive computation model was able to predict where and when these shifts would happen, based on which dots were more relevant to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mental-effort-involved-in-a-task"&gt;Mental effort involved in a task&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another version of the task, participants still tracked a handful of dots, but the researchers changed how many “distractor” dots appeared and how fast they moved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, people rated how hard the task felt. Interestingly, the model’s predictions matched the participants’ feelings: when the model worked harder to track the targets, participants said the task felt harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the model gave insight into something very human – the mental effort we feel when concentrating on a tough task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mimicking-the-brain-s-ability-to-focus"&gt;Mimicking the brain’s ability to focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising takeaway from this work is how our brains selectively “ignore” things. That eye-catching car or glowing billboard? If it doesn’t help with what we’re trying to do, it might just disappear from our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to work out the computational logic of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/action-observation-network-human-brain-perception-see-what-we-expect-to-see-mind-eye/"&gt;human mind&lt;/a&gt;, by creating new algorithms of perception and attention, and comparing the performance of these algorithms to that of humans,” Yildirim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could even guide how we build future &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-the-human-brain-outperform-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike current AI systems that try to absorb everything, this new model mimics how humans sometimes miss obvious things – not due to error, but because it’s a smart way to focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this line of work can lead to systems that are a bit different from today’s AI, something more human-like,” Yildirim said. “This would be an AI system that when tasked with a goal might miss things, even shiny things, so as to flexibly and safely interact with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Frev0000572"&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:39:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNSldOWTl6dEc0N3VETWZlczFpNm1ybGc2ZUNXbmVvZGdtYmotZzIwVnJEb3RlaXZoOG1aWDB0QXBIMDVONTNGZkstdXIzaXM2dWhJQ3FSSktHcXFqVFNlMVEtSWdtcHh1NkFmSzI0Nlpoa0FSbGhiSXlKSWZZUXFDNmk0Ulp3OEQxNkU4S2Rn</guid></item><item><title>小本杰明娜，人类社会同理心的最古老证据- Earth.com | Little Benjamina, the oldest evidence of social empathy in humans - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQU1dVWXVPY3Brd2V4TWZKUGZELXhmNnJJNVhCWm50LTRqT3hrcFlqZDQyR3paV3pZYVFZeFVrS2Nxdi1GWks5b1lWWmxfdWxWV2x0cHlUQzFodXFnWm42RFlscHpCdWJPWEcwYlljdng5cnRNNEhwZl9OajY4Vzk3SUtLXzljc1FqbzRVenhzN2g5N0NNMUhv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamina’s small cranium lay hidden in Spain’s &lt;a href="https://engines.egr.uh.edu/episode/2516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Atapuerca Mountains&lt;/a&gt; for more than half a million years. Today her story challenges long‑held ideas about when human empathy first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://produccioncientifica.ucm.es/investigadores/141651/detalle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Juan Luis Arsuaga&lt;/a&gt; of the Complutense University of Madrid, who directs the Sima de los Huesos excavations, says the child’s remains force scientists to rethink social life in the Middle Pleistocene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excavators &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38454744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cataloged&lt;/a&gt; Benjamina as &lt;em&gt;Cranium 14&lt;/em&gt;, an almost complete neurocranium from a &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; girl aged about ten to twelve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computed‑tomography measurements place her brain volume near 1,200 cm³, slightly smaller than that of many modern pre‑teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-piecing-together-benjamina-s-life"&gt;Piecing together Benjamina’s life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early restoration revealed that the left limb of the back‑of‑head suture had fused before birth, a condition called lambdoid synostosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True fusion of this suture occurs in only two percent of craniosynostosis cases, making it the rarest form of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern epidemiology puts overall &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544366/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;craniosynostosis&lt;/a&gt; prevalence at roughly one in 2,000 births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the fused bone cannot expand, pressure diverts growth toward the forehead and opposite side, creating the asymmetrical dome seen on Benjamina’s right parietal plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-lambdoid-synostosis"&gt;Understanding lambdoid synostosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgeons today open the fused bone within an infant’s first year to prevent raised intracranial pressure and vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without intervention, secondary problems such as headaches, balance issues, and cognitive delays often follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamina obviously received no operation. Even so, she survived long enough to lose baby teeth and grow permanent molars, milestones that show she lived at least a decade despite her deformity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benjamina offers early evidence of empathy and social cohesion in our evolutionary history,” noted the excavation team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping a disabled child alive in a hunter‑gatherer context would have required help with food, protection, and possibly mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeletal &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/science/article/2024/07/11/bone-of-neanderthal-child-provides-evidence-of-social-care-in-prehistoric-times_6680969_10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of Neanderthals from nearby Valencia present a similar pattern, where a six‑year‑old with severe inner‑ear malformations lived well past infancy only through sustained group support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together these Iberian fossils imply that caregiving emerged deep within the genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; rather than as a late feature of our own species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-name-benjamina-matters"&gt;Why the name Benjamina matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Benjamina comes from the Hebrew word for the youngest or most beloved &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/28000-year-old-hybrid-child-confirms-interbreeding-between-humans-and-neanderthals/"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers chose it not only because of her young age, but because of the care she likely received during her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigning her a name also reflects a growing trend in paleoanthropology to humanize ancient individuals. It helps the public connect with prehistoric stories, not just as data points, but as once-living members of a social group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her group’s willingness to invest resources in a non‑productive juvenile hints at emotional bonds, shared responsibility, and perhaps rudimentary social norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those traits would later underpin cooperative hunting, extended childhoods, and the cultural explosion that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamina also broadens the medical record. The report calls her cranium “the earliest evidence of craniosynostosis occurring in a hominid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documenting pathology this ancient helps geneticists trace how skull‑fusion genes evolved.

I believe this approach will eventually become more accepted,” said &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/789683/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martín‑Olalla&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://ics-seville.org/university-of-seville/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Seville&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the value of introducing this proof to students early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By rooting the theorem in the second law itself, rather than a loosely attached third principle, the argument might resonate with a new generation of physicists seeking internal consistency. Martín‑Olalla acknowledged the resistance that often meets reinterpretations of established theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier fossil skulls like the &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sale-paleoanthropological-site-Morocco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Salé cranium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Singa-cranium-left-and-Broken-Hill-cranium-right-were-two-human-fossils-studied_fig5_283709064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Singa 1&lt;/a&gt; showed deformities, but neither could be definitively diagnosed with true lambdoid synostosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Benjamina, these individuals lacked the distinctive skull features or CT data needed to confirm the rare fusion type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other historical examples, such as the deformed skulls from the &lt;a href="https://www.archaeologs.com/w/munsingen-rain/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Münsingen-Rain&lt;/a&gt; burial site in Switzerland or the &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/82867462/The_earliest_evidence_of_true_lambdoid_craniosynostosis_the_case_of_Benjamina_a_Homo_heidelbergensis_child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bab-al-Hanax cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, occurred much later and show more variation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamina remains the oldest confirmed case with such precision in diagnosis, giving her a unique place in paleopathological records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38454744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Child’s Nervous System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:14:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQU1dVWXVPY3Brd2V4TWZKUGZELXhmNnJJNVhCWm50LTRqT3hrcFlqZDQyR3paV3pZYVFZeFVrS2Nxdi1GWks5b1lWWmxfdWxWV2x0cHlUQzFodXFnWm42RFlscHpCdWJPWEcwYlljdng5cnRNNEhwZl9OajY4Vzk3SUtLXzljc1FqbzRVenhzN2g5N0NNMUhv</guid></item><item><title>如何全年保护自己免受蜱虫侵害- NBC新闻 | How to protect yourself from ticks year-round - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRjd2VmtoSzJXWUtKcEl0UGRZMEpwbzgtWW5yQlN4bWJIajQ4SDhaUnpZTGJUWUthbWE0U0RPd3ZGVk1pU2k0S1ozc2lwZE9QdktETkZnRnFUVG1VcERTUjBELTkteUx0dEw3Nng1eWw5VFVlR2JMeDFWQThNQWd4RE81S3I1ZzZqemMwbTY1Zl9MQdIBVkFVX3lxTE84UnFVbWRINkJSaV95TlBxeUpFSFRvY09KYzduc0NNcFhWb3h0UWY1ZTVfMnJBc0ZNUnY5NkVaZ3V5N2tQdE42aWMzRTZfQTZfdWtzYXJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f53a0" class="body-graf"&gt;WASHINGTON — Ticks can be active in any season and it’s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible — especially after you’ve been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7b0ce" class="body-graf"&gt;“Humans are outside more in summer so we hear about more &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-science-says-us-news-ticks-ct-state-wire-8fe81bb7613b4499a965f6ec209332bd"&gt;tick infections&lt;/a&gt;,” said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ticks-lyme-disease-bite-a28b25bc0d6103b02b48b2fbba65b5a3"&gt;urges caution year-round&lt;/a&gt; because “every season is tick season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-125877" class="body-graf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/beyond-lyme-new-illnesses-more-reason-to-watch-for-ticks-833977ed415d4218957f8efc04845b1a"&gt;tick populations&lt;/a&gt; vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing “above average” numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f0dd7" class="body-graf"&gt;And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-304898" class="body-heading"&gt;How ticks can spread disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6eb951" class="body-graf"&gt;Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders — with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec3b0" class="body-graf"&gt;There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d0ddb" class="body-graf"&gt;A tick bite doesn’t always lead to illness. “If you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it’s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,” said Telford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-099d4e" class="body-heading"&gt;How to check for ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13a475" class="body-graf"&gt;Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-126445" class="body-graf"&gt;Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ec30c" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,” said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. “When you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you’re also more likely to spot any other ticks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8726d1" class="body-graf"&gt;Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don’t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7b8e3c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to keep ticks away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4017b6" class="body-graf"&gt;The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6091a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c16b46" class="body-graf"&gt;Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8f82b1" class="body-heading"&gt;Protect your pets from ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5c4de" class="body-graf"&gt;Don’t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog’s skin. But it’s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-017667" class="body-graf"&gt;“Wherever pets can’t easily groom themselves, that’s where the ticks will be — on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,” said Thangamani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e26db6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21a263" class="body-graf"&gt;“If pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,” which could be another household member, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-61efce" class="body-heading"&gt;What to do after a tick bite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52e0a7" class="body-graf"&gt;After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d6266" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:03:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRjd2VmtoSzJXWUtKcEl0UGRZMEpwbzgtWW5yQlN4bWJIajQ4SDhaUnpZTGJUWUthbWE0U0RPd3ZGVk1pU2k0S1ozc2lwZE9QdktETkZnRnFUVG1VcERTUjBELTkteUx0dEw3Nng1eWw5VFVlR2JMeDFWQThNQWd4RE81S3I1ZzZqemMwbTY1Zl9MQdIBVkFVX3lxTE84UnFVbWRINkJSaV95TlBxeUpFSFRvY09KYzduc0NNcFhWb3h0UWY1ZTVfMnJBc0ZNUnY5NkVaZ3V5N2tQdE42aWMzRTZfQTZfdWtzYXJ3</guid></item><item><title>您的钱包可以提前十年警告痴呆症- SciTechDaily | Your Wallet Could Warn of Dementia a Decade Early - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNRURVM1pabnkzc1ZlUGEyZ0QwWEpYaWQ2Tml0X1dGZHdWQWcxRERDSGxRaUgxOXFZaEJGbHRHUkw1QlRJN25rQ0IzVmlxQmFfcld4SXFaV2ktOWZycG5fVFRPQnFwM3JrcWV1MV94cmpzMHNJblVybjdOTHpwWHFMZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:21:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNRURVM1pabnkzc1ZlUGEyZ0QwWEpYaWQ2Tml0X1dGZHdWQWcxRERDSGxRaUgxOXFZaEJGbHRHUkw1QlRJN25rQ0IzVmlxQmFfcld4SXFaV2ktOWZycG5fVFRPQnFwM3JrcWV1MV94cmpzMHNJblVybjdOTHpwWHFMZg</guid></item><item><title>认识吃脑变形虫- Ynetnews | Meet the brain-eating amoeba - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5pci1Sdzc1OF9uRk1RMUxBSE9PckZuRkdOM1lhU0lsSC1UbnZ4NDR2VDFiUWRsYWY1RG5wRktwbGRPR29fdXpXcU83bW5JOU1obklrMGx4ZWhGZ0tQY0tOTnhWYU1UTHZud3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="938op-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="938op-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="938op-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;On May 29, 2025, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  confirmed that a 71-year-old woman in Texas died after contracting the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="BJI11xzj36Vle" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/rjrryb0ur" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="938op-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“brain-eating amoeba,” Naegleria fowleri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="938op-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;, by rinsing her sinuses with tap water from an RV at a campground near Austin.

It is extremely rare and highly lethal.  In the United States, an average of just three cases are reported each year, and nearly all result in death. Between 1962 and 2021, only four out of 154 known patients survivedPDF file, reflecting a fatality rate exceeding 97 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="88m4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="88m4o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="88m4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Almost all patients with PAM—most of whom are male—experience symptoms that resemble bacterial meningitis. The early symptoms include a very severe frontal headache (often between the eyes), fever, nausea, and vomiting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="b4tck-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b4tck-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b4tck-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Soon afterward, neck stiffness (a classic sign of meningitis) appears. In the specific case of PAM, patients also suffer from a loss of the sense of smell. Neurological symptoms quickly worsen and may include confusion, light sensitivity, hallucinations, and seizures—progressing to coma and, in most cases, death within five days of symptom onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="8etmq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8etmq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8etmq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Because the disease is so rare and its symptoms mimic those of far more common bacterial meningitis, it is easy to misdiagnose unless healthcare providers are aware of its existence.

Instead, it exists freely in warm freshwater and soil and is found worldwide. Scientifically known as Naegleria fowleri, it is a single-celled, nucleus-containing organism from the genus Naegleria, within the phylum Heterolobosea and the group Discoba.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="1kh8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1kh8t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1kh8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In warm freshwater, Naegleria fowleri exists primarily in its amoeba form—an amorphous, single-celled organism that moves using pseudopods ("false feet") and feeds on bacteria, yeast, and algae along the bottom. This is known as the trophozoite stage, during which the amoeba can eat, reproduce by cell division, and—accidentally—in rare cases, infect humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="abehm-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.ryl8b7YpNgx" id="image_ArticleImageData.ryl8b7YpNgx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryl8b7YpNgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/28/BkgYxzY6Egx/BkgYxzY6Egx_0_0_2000_1509_0_x-large.jpg" alt="Life cycle of the amoeba" title="Life cycle of the amoeba (Life cycle of the amoeba) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryl8b7YpNgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/28/BkgYxzY6Egx/BkgYxzY6Egx_0_0_2000_1509_0_x-large.jpg" alt="Life cycle of the amoeba" title="Life cycle of the amoeba (Life cycle of the amoeba) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Life cycle of the amoeba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Life cycle of the amoeba&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="5487a-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5487a-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5487a-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;When environmental conditions become unfavorable, such as when food becomes scarce, the amoeba temporarily transforms into a flagellate stage—a pear-shaped, motile cell with two small whip-like flagella that help it swim in search of a better environment.

The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 35°C and 46°C (95–115°F), making infections more likely during hot weather and summer months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="d8j0f-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d8j0f-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d8j0f-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;If a person swims or dives in water where Naegleria fowleri is present—especially in a way that splashes water and stirs up sediment from the bottom—water may enter the nasal cavity, carrying amoebas with it.

While this barrier protects the brain from harmful substances and pathogens, it also blocks many potentially life-saving medications.  To bypass this limitation, drugs must be given at much higher-than-normal doses, which increases the risk of serious side effects, including kidney damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="ckidf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ckidf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ckidf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In addition to anti-amoebic drugs, patients receive supportive care to reduce inflammation, intracranial pressure, and cerebral edema. This often includes the steroid medication dexamethasone and, in some cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Targeted temperature management (TTM), which involves deliberately lowering the body temperature to 32–34°C, has also been used in some instances. Cooling helps relieve brain swelling and may potentially damage the heat-loving amoeba.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="5cg8a-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5cg8a-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5cg8a-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Research into improved treatments for Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) remains limited due to the disease’s rarity.

Drawing on earlier studies in which free-living, non-parasitic amoebas introduced into the noses of mice caused fatal brain infections, they hypothesized that the patients had been infected in a similar way: the amoebas entered through the nose and traveled directly to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="3nrg0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3nrg0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3nrg0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Following the publication of Fowler and Carter’s paper, physicians and researchers began re-examining past encephalitis cases, leading to the retrospective identification of additional PAM cases. In 1966, American pathologist Cecil Butt reported on three boys from central Florida who had died after being infected with the amoeba—two of them as early as 1962. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="8vtjo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8vtjo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8vtjo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He coined the term Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis to emphasize that the brain inflammation resulted from a primary, or direct, amoebic infection of the brain. In 1970, Carter named the species Naegleria fowleri in honor of Fowler, “who was the first to recognize the disease it causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="28h6r-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28h6r-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28h6r-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The earliest confirmed case of PAM known today was found in a preserved brain specimen at a pathological museum in London, scheduled for disposal. Museum records had labeled the specimen as showing “carcinomatous infiltration of the leptomeninges. April 1909. Boy from Essex.” However, a re-examination of the sample in the late 1960s revealed that the supposed cancerous growths were actually Naegleria fowleri amoeba cells and the tissue damage they had caused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="e2ucf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e2ucf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e2ucf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Since the disease was first identified, hundreds of cases have been reported worldwide—most often during warmer seasons. The majority of documented cases have occurred in the United States, Pakistan, Mexico, India, Australia, and the Czech Republic. Surprisingly, relatively few PAM cases have been reported from tropical regions, despite their warm climates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="4948b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4948b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4948b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This likely reflects underreporting, due to limited awareness, a lack of diagnostic resources, and the tendency for this rare disease to be overlooked amid the prevalence of more common diseases in these areas. Even in the United States, most PAM cases likely go unreported. One estimate suggests that for every three confirmed deaths from the disease, another 13 deaths caused by Naegleria go undiagnosed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="6b9hf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6b9hf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6b9hf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;As awareness of the disease grows, so does the number of correctly diagnosed infections.

Thus, even with increasing awareness, the known cases likely represent only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="cindr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cindr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cindr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The global increase in cases of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) appears to be driven not only by greater awareness and improved diagnosis, but also by rising global temperatures caused by the climate crisis, which allow Naegleria fowleri to thrive and spread to new regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="ee7s9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ee7s9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ee7s9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In Karachi, for example, the climate has always been favorable to Naegleria fowleri—hot and humid, particularly in summer. But in recent years, average temperatures have risen, and the city has experienced more frequent and intense heatwaves. These shifts, likely attributed to climate change, may be contributing to the amoeba's increased prevalence in the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="do0kb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="do0kb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="do0kb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This trend is particularly evident in the United States, where Naegleria has been monitored for many years. For decades, PAM cases were limited to warm southern states such as Florida and Texas. However, since 2010, infections have also been reported in central and northern states—a change attributed to climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="a9end-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a9end-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a9end-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One notable case occurred in the summer of 2010, when a 7-year-old girl in Minnesota contracted the amoeba and died after swimming in a lake during a period of unusually high temperatures. The infection occurred roughly 900 kilometers north of the previously known northernmost case. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="52g4b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="52g4b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="52g4b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Two years later, a 9-year-old boy died from PAM after swimming in the same lake during another exceptionally hot summer. Since then, more PAM cases associated with high temperatures have been reported in northern U.S. states, including Indiana, Maryland, northern California, Iowa, and Nebraska.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="12vrg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="12vrg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="12vrg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In short, global warming leads to higher temperatures and warmer waters—conditions in which Naegleria fowleri thrives. Rising heat also drives more people to seek relief in the water, increasing the risk of exposure to the amoeba. Additionally, climate change may cause droughts in some regions, prompting people to store water, such as rainwater. These stored supplies can become ideal breeding grounds for the amoeba, further elevating the risk of infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="500pj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="500pj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="500pj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;However, even complete dryness may not offer protection from the amoeba. Its cysts have been detected in airborne dust, particularly during the dry Harmattan season in West Africa. It’s possible that inhalation could allows these cysts to reactivate in the nasal passages and cause disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="571dn-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="571dn-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="571dn-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yet, in these same dry African regions, live amoebas have been found in the nasal passages of children who have not developed illness. Similarly, healthy individuals worldwide have been found to carry antibodies against Naegleria fowleri, suggesting past exposure without illness. In other words, there are documented cases in which people were exposed to the amoeba, it entered their nasal passages, but did not cause disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="75i82-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SklfSXta4xl" id="image_ArticleImageData.SklfSXta4xl"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SklfSXta4xl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/28/B1HFgGYTNxg/B1HFgGYTNxg_0_0_580_400_0_x-large.jpg" alt="Boys swimming in a water source in Pakistan" title="Boys swimming in a water source in Pakistan (Photo: From Siddiqui and Khan 2014) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SklfSXta4xl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/28/B1HFgGYTNxg/B1HFgGYTNxg_0_0_580_400_0_x-large.jpg" alt="Boys swimming in a water source in Pakistan" title="Boys swimming in a water source in Pakistan (Photo: From Siddiqui and Khan 2014) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Boys swimming in a water source in Pakistan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: From Siddiqui and Khan 2014&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="360j1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="360j1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="360j1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Though deadly, Naegleria fowleri infections are extremely rare and primarily affect healthy individuals engaging in routine recreational activities—one reason the disease often draws media attention. However, as Nebraska State Epidemiologist Matthew Donahue put it, "Millions of recreational water exposures occur each year, while only 0 to 8 Naegleria fowleri infections are identified each year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="bd8di-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bd8di-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bd8di-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;As NPR emphasized, despite millions of recreational water exposures yeach year, there have been only 31 reported infections in the United States in the 10 years from 2012 to 2021. In comparison, nearly 4,000 people died from unintentional drowning each year during that same time period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="17eor-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="17eor-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="17eor-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, while the likelihood of infection is exceptionally low and should not cause undue fear, it is important not to ignore the risk, given the infection’s almost universal fatality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="f7d04-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f7d04-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f7d04-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fortunately, the risk of infection can be reduced through relatively simple measures. Proper maintenance of disinfection systems in swimming pools and water parks, cooling the water, and chlorination (adding chlorine to disinfect water) help prevent the amoeba from thriving. Chlorinating drinking water supplies is also crucial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="eu3db-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eu3db-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eu3db-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In South Australia, where PAM was first identified, no infections have occurred since 1981, thanks to a public awareness campaign and routine chlorination of water sources. In contrast, in 2016, a teenage girl died after being contracting Naegleria fowleri at a water park in North Carolina, where the water had not been adequately disinfected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="8501k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8501k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8501k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While natural water sources cannot be chlorinated or cooled, you can still reduce your risk of infection by following a few simple precautions. One option is to avoid entering or swimming in warm freshwater during hot seasons, when water temperatures are highest—though admittedly, that’s not the most appealing advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="kqku-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="kqku-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="kqku-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;More easily implementable steps include avoiding jumping into warm freshwater, or at least pinching your nose if you do, to prevent water from entering the nasal passages. When swimming, try to keep your head above water and avoid full submersion—especially in hot springs. Also, try not to disturb the bottom, as this can stir up amoebas from the sediment. Using nose plugs is strongly recommended, especially if you enjoy diving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="63n51-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="63n51-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="63n51-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Since the amoeba infects only through the nose, it’s important to exercise caution during any activity that could force water into the nasal passages. In practices where water is intentionally introduced into the nose—such as certain religious purification rituals or the use of a neti pot—experts recommend using only distilled water from a sealed container, or water that has been boiled and cooled. Tap water should never be used for these purposes unless it has been properly treated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="6geku" data-offset-key="2g03u-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2g03u-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2g03u-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;By following these guidelines and continuing to monitor water sources for contamination, we can reduce the already low risk of infection and continue to enjoy freshwater activities—even on a warming planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:15:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5pci1Sdzc1OF9uRk1RMUxBSE9PckZuRkdOM1lhU0lsSC1UbnZ4NDR2VDFiUWRsYWY1RG5wRktwbGRPR29fdXpXcU83bW5JOU1obklrMGx4ZWhGZ0tQY0tOTnhWYU1UTHZud3c</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，排名第一的蔬菜可以多吃以减少内脏脂肪- EatingWell | The #1 Vegetable to Eat More Of to Reduce Visceral Fat, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9CM3MxWXFpYXNBeDY3aDJSMEJwNWRKazlneV9vLXdYd21VZERXakF0clBJSHNRbXVlSlZUZm5HYmkxQUk2Ti1qNTI1bk5NLTlXUWx3RlNSb3o5MTh0X1FWeUhtYkd5eXlUelFwbnB0R3hmSnZkYUw1aDNZUWp0Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visceral fat is deep belly fat that can raise the risk of diabetes, heart disease and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating carotenoid- and fiber-rich vegetables may help protect against this harmful fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spinach is packed with these compounds, making it a top choice for reducing visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat is the type of fat that lies deep in the abdomen and around the middle of the body. It’s linked to a long list of chronic health conditions like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8038155/research-testing-for-type-2-diabetes-at-physical-exam/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lifestyle habits like exercise, sleep and stress management can play a key role in the amount of visceral fat your body accumulates. So can the foods you eat, especially vegetables. While many vegetables can help protect against this stubborn belly fat, dietitians say the best one of all is spinach.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spinach is rich in powerful plant compounds called carotenoids, especially lutein and zeaxanthin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Carotenoid-rich vegetables like spinach can potentially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; by increasing fat oxidation and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,” says&lt;a href="https://mydietitianmolly.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt; Molly Synder, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carotenoid-rich vegetables [like spinach] are high in fiber and water, which promote fullness, reduce calorie intake and improve cholesterol levels often linked to visceral fat,” says&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Diane Han, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Of course, carotenoids alone won’t cause fat loss, but regularly including carotenoid-rich vegetables like spinach&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in meals, along with protein, fiber and healthy fats, supports a metabolic environment that can help reduce visceral fat over time,”  says &lt;a href="http://www.anarallidina.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anar Allidina, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. For even more visceral fat-reducing power, try these dietitian-approved strategies:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving. &lt;/strong&gt;Both resistance training and aerobic exercise may be beneficial for reducing visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, you don’t have to spend hours in the gym to reap their benefits. “Even short daily walks after meals &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290662/how-to-lose-belly-fat-fast/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce belly fat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;,” says Allidina. The most important thing is consistency to prevent muscle loss over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Enough Protein. &lt;/strong&gt;“Protein helps preserve lean muscle, supports metabolism and keeps you full,” says Allidina. The typical adult requires 0.36 grams of protein daily for each pound they weigh.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the biggest nutritional bang, eat a variety of protein-rich whole foods rather than supplements. And don’t forget &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-plant-based-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11735924" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber-rich plant proteins&lt;/a&gt; like beans, tofu, edamame and lentils, which can benefit gut health and promote satiety.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Living a high-stress lifestyle without the tools to manage it can take a toll on your health and contribute to excess visceral fat. That’s because stress increases cortisol, a hormone that promotes fat accumulation around the abdomen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Stress-management techniques that include mindfulness and relaxation may help keep cortisol in check.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Try deep breathing, yoga, journaling, time in nature or anything else that helps you feel calm and present,” says Allidina.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s easy to eat too many added sugars, especially if you typically eat lots of highly processed foods or drink &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Trouble is, people who consume lots of added sugars tend to have more visceral fat than those who eat few added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re wondering how much is too much, stick with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations of no more than 10% of total calories from added sugars. That’s 50 grams of added sugars per day for someone who eats 2,000 calories daily.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat can spell trouble for your health in all sorts of ways. Fortunately, certain foods can help reduce visceral fat or prevent it from creeping up in the first place. And spinach is a great place to start. In fact, spinach is dietitians’ favorite vegetable for reducing visceral fat. This nutritious leafy green is filled with carotenoids that may inhibit fat storage and fight &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;visceral fat-promoting inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. It also provides &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-to-lose-visceral-fat-8771208" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber, which has been linked to lower visceral fat levels&lt;/a&gt; and helps keep you full and satisfied. Plus, spinach is super-versatile. Whether you like it blended into a smoothie, piled high in a leafy green salad, tucked into a sandwich or stirred into soup, pasta or eggs, there are countless ways to enjoy this good-for-you leafy green. So, toss a bunch in your shopping cart today!&lt;br&gt;

New evidence from a rare twin study now points a clear finger at two species of bacteria that hide in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which compared 81 pairs of genetically identical siblings, singled out &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; as the most likely triggers of the nerve‑damaging disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna-Peters-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Anna Peters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich&lt;/a&gt; steered the international team that linked these bacteria to disease in both people and mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-clues-in-identical-twins"&gt;Tracing clues in identical twins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identical twins share nearly every gene, so differences in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-study-shows-that-dairy-milk-cheese-consumption-improves-gut-biodiversity-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; are often related to outside factors. By focusing on twins where only one sibling had MS, the researchers stripped away much genetic noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed DNA tracking of gut samples revealed 51 microbial candidates whose numbers diverged between affected and unaffected siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two species of bacteria kept resurfacing with the highest odds ratios, putting them at the top of the watch list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those samples came from the ileum, the last stretch of small intestine that hosts a busy immune garrison. The choice mattered because &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3651097/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pro‑inflammatory T cells&lt;/a&gt; gather here before they head for the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later comparison with the 1,152‑person &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36113426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International MS Microbiome Study&lt;/a&gt; echoed the same two species of bacteria. The overlap gave the Munich team confidence that their twin cohort was not a statistical fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-bacteria-linked-to-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;Gut bacteria linked to multiple sclerosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test cause rather than correlation, the investigators moved beyond sequencing. They transplanted ileal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microbes-found-alive-sealed-inside-rock-after-2-billion-years/"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; from selected twins into germ‑free mice bred to develop MS‑like inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animals that received bacteria from the sibling with multiple sclerosis, paralysis appeared within twelve weeks. Mice given microbes from the healthy twin stayed mobile the entire study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three female mice in one experiment showed a dramatic bloom of &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; just before MS symptoms set in. Their stool lost other common bacterial genera, hinting that the bloom crowded out potential competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow‑up transfer from another twin pair repeated the outcome, this time with &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; dominating late in the trial. The signal again skewed toward female animals, matching the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/news-and-magazine/momentum-magazine/the-ms-experience/ms-facts-vs-myths" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of MS seen in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, more than sixty percent of mice given “MS” bacteria developed spinal lesions, compared with fewer than ten percent in control groups. No other single species rose in step with disease across experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fiber-digesting-bacteria-and-inflammation"&gt;Fiber-digesting bacteria and inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; belong to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lachnospiraceae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lachnospiraceae family&lt;/a&gt;, a large clan of anaerobes that usually help digest fiber. Most relatives are considered harmless and even beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets these two apart is not yet clear, but the German group noted that both can thrive on mucus sugars when dietary fiber is scarce. That ability could thin the intestinal barrier and expose immune sensors to microbial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier work on &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; showed a similar mucus‑eating habit that sometimes heightens inflammation. The new study hints the same mechanism may operate here but in a much smaller bacterial niche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another clue comes from metabolic profiling, which found that &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; produces ethanol and succinate, both known to stimulate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29894669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Th17 immune cells&lt;/a&gt;. Excess Th17 activity drives attack on myelin, the insulating layer around nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-lachnospiraceae-may-stir-trouble"&gt;Why Lachnospiraceae may stir trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled ulcerative colitis model, certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-depression-contagious-couples-may-share-it-through-kissing/"&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/a&gt; pushed macrophages toward an aggressive stance. Similar macrophage patterns emerged in the spinal cords of the colonized mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies, however, have reported anti‑inflammatory roles for different members of the family, underscoring that taxonomy alone is not destiny. Context, gene content, and surrounding microbes all shape outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin study design hints that environment tilts the balance, because both siblings inherit the same immune genes. Diet, antibiotics, or viral history may give the two microbes the foothold they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together with our functional studies, this supports our conclusion that these bacteria might play a crucial role as environmental triggering factors of human multiple sclerosis,” wrote the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement marks one of the strongest causal claims yet made about the role of gut bacteria in the development of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-multiple-sclerosis-bacteria-treatment"&gt;Multiple sclerosis bacteria treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000007044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one million Americans&lt;/a&gt; live with MS, and existing drugs only slow its progress. Targeting a pair of bacteria offers a simpler aim than re‑engineering the whole gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers already use narrow antibiotics, phage cocktails, and engineered probiotics to chase single species in the gut. Similar tools could curb &lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; before they spark immune trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another route involves adding fiber to keep mucus eaters occupied with safer food. Early trials of high‑propionate diets have shown modest symptom relief and could complement microbe‑directed therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-and-next-steps"&gt;Limitations and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any multiple sclerosis therapy will also need to respect the wider community of gut bacteria that support vitamin synthesis and immune tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the wrong microbial strains could backfire, as seen when broad antibiotics sometimes worsen autoimmune flares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That risk has pushed researchers toward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36191844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteriophages&lt;/a&gt;, viruses that hunt specific bacteria, which are already in early studies for inflammatory bowel disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar designer phage could trim the Lachnospiraceae culprits while leaving friendly neighbors untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will demand hard proof that tweaking the microbiome alters biomarkers such as neurofilament light, a blood protein that rises when neurons die. The twin‑mouse pipeline described by Peters now offers a way to collect that evidence quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued collaboration between neurologists, immunologists, and microbial ecologists will decide how quickly these insights can be turned into medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the results give patients a tangible target, and a fresh reason to care about what lives in their gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 14:29:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQaGxKcGN1WWFxVF9ELVI3bTdHTWxBVXZfVE1URnJjNVhUM0xvRFZTUVZnVVFmVWtmanFXNVBlZ0Q3V3dYa3RibmFGMl9yOW9MNWFiSXRiM1lzQk9RYnRxdG5pNFRxbTZkbEExNzJPczcyQ2xjTnRRTFRvVEd0MmlGYVk1ckdiM0F6VnE4LVB1WUFETDVlTUxvaTgyOVF5d0IwbGUwaA</guid></item></channel></rss>
