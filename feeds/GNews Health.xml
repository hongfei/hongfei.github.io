But they're not a silver bullet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The market for vitamin and mineral supplements is estimated to be worth &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/hmo/otc-pharmaceuticals/vitamins-minerals/worldwide" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;$32.7bn (£24.2bn)&lt;/a&gt;, and over &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/three-quarters-americans-take-dietary-supplements-most-users-agree-they-are-essential#:~:text=Topline%20data%20from%20the%202023,qualifying%20as%20" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;74% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/articles/should_you_take_vitamin_supplements" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;two-thirds of Britons&lt;/a&gt; admit to using them in an effort to improve their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the pills are mired in controversy, with some studies suggesting they have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2018.04.020" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;no discernible health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and others finding they could even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10930792/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;harm you&lt;/a&gt;. So what does the evidence really say? Should we all be taking vitamin supplements, or just some of us? Does anyone even need to take them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="why-do-people-take-vitamins-and-minerals?" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;Why do people take vitamins and minerals?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vitamins and minerals are compounds that our bodies do not make, but which are nevertheless essential for our health. As we cannot make them, we must get them from our food. Examples include &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-a/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;; which is vital for good eyesight and maintaining healthy skin; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-c/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin C,&lt;/a&gt; which is essential for a healthy immune system, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-k/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;; which is necessary for blood clotting. Essential minerals, meanwhile, include calcium, magnesium, selenium, potassium, and&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; others&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamins and minerals are classed as micronutrients because we only need them in small amounts compared to macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's fair to say that no supplement will ever replace a healthy and balanced diet. The best way, therefore, of meeting the body's requirement for vitamins is through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/food-and-nutrition/eating-well/vitamins-and-minerals/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;eating plenty&lt;/a&gt; of leafy green vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, dairy, and fish. However, research also shows that many of us are not managing to adhere to this practice. The rise of fast food, along with ultra-processed products, means convenience often triumphs over a fresh home-cooked meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOMExrV3pGY1NyV25Sckx0ZERTbVMxZ3JuNlJ4TXRCREJlWlBmT2tKSnRpdW54c3pVY3ZEZTZRTkpmZzhfeVRpTXRZTTNEVm5QOFNCay1lbmhGRDZyQnlFd1A0Rm8xM2JpQWVUQnd5SDNERWwtY3pyUEY4MkQ3clNPNElHYi1wQ09hc0l2N2R1eUM</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心就“致残和致命”疾病向五个新国家发布旅行警告--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZFpsOVcwN1RpNGpyYXFqdU9xdnV3Y3poUU9xQlI5M2JJYm1Sb3RTU2w3TWpybVp2OWl1a1dQbmhiMnY3b0ViWEhaZV9ZcEtMTjd2eW1nS3N3TUZNZFkyb0pOVE1BVDc4RmVMSFAwOGFneEJsRlhfZzRyQWRZWjVRTF9KRm9QSE1saHBIbUVmMHhsOWFpRjU0QUhtTXRaZlZBYl81V2JR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9fMjdTbWgzMkN6UGNmNUQxdmtva1VkY01XY0Y1MVVWT3lvb3h1b1RGQ1lhQzJBR3VUWjRHdE9yZm9GZ2pJV3ZlTTNqQWRLbWNxc2VNWHdFenVfRnVzNEVJNnk1MEJkcEdjNGpZa1YzR3lqdTQ3dXJ3NXhkeWlEUk90TnhUbVVFejVnSEE2aGIyck5mQlMxdEJHWVIzdi0xVmZIUmVZd2c0UnExVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Federal health officials have issued an urgent travel warning over a ‘crippling and deadly disease.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-c5236a30-76eb-11f0-b75e-b3c1b1f26e53"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; issued travel advisories for the UK, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-c52713b0-76eb-11f0-b75e-b3c1b1f26e53" class=""&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-c526c590-76eb-11f0-b75e-b3c1b1f26e53"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/poland/index.html" id="mol-c527aff0-76eb-11f0-b75e-b3c1b1f26e53"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/spain/index.html" id="mol-c527d700-76eb-11f0-b75e-b3c1b1f26e53"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; where cases of polio, a highly infectious virus that spreads through airborne droplets and feces and attacks the nervous system, are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the virus lurks silently for most people, severe cases can lead to muscle weakness and stiffness, spasms, trouble swallowing and full-body paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polio can also paralyze the lungs and other muscles responsible for breathing, leading to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was wiped out of the US in 1979, two decades after the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14199215/robert-kennedy-polio-vaccine-controversy-trump-mcconnell.html"&gt;advent of the polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and only sporadic cases have popped up on American soil since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polio has been detected in 39 total countries and territories within the last year, most of which are in Africa and the Middle East, according to the latest CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccines are routinely offered in the five countries where polio is circulating and it’s unclear exactly where the virus was detected, but it’s possible it was found in wastewater from asymptomatic infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC’s level 2 travel advisory urges Americans traveling to these countries to take ‘enhanced’ protections like being up to date on the polio vaccine or getting a booster ahead of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Polio is a nervous system disease that was once the most feared in the world before vaccines were introduced in the 1950s. Pictured above is a polio patient in 1947&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Poliovirus spreads through droplets from sneezing and coughing, as well as feces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency said: ‘Before any international travel, make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK’s last confirmed case of polio was in 1984, but it was last detected in wastewater in 2022. The entire European region was declared polio-free by the World Health Organization in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious nervous system disease spread by the poliovirus, which targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naturally-occurring poliovirus, or wild-type poliovirus, has been eradicated from the US and most developed countries, while another version derived from vaccines is more common but still rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People carrying poliovirus can spread it through droplets from sneezing or coughing and feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While about nine in 10 people with polio don’t develop symptoms, around five percent report mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. This is called ‘abortive polio.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one percent of patients develop nonparalytic polio, which causes more severe flu-like symptoms, neck and spine stiffness, decreased reflexes and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonparalytic polio can progress to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. It leads to intense pain, extreme sensitivity to touch, tingling sensations, muscle spasms of twitching and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paralytic polio can affect any limb or organ, but if it spreads to the lungs, it could lead to deadly breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC said in its advisory: ‘Polio can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paul Alexander of Texas (pictured here) was paralyzed from polio at age six. He used an iron lung machine for most of his life to breathe before his death in 2024 at age 78&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Polio infections have been eradicated from developed nations like the US, but it has been shown to be circulating in 39 nations, including five in Europe. Pictured above is a child in Pakistan receiving an oral polio vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last confirmed case of polio in the US was in 2022 in an unvaccinated adult from Rockland County, New York, just outside of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unidentified individual reported a fever, stiff neck, constipation and back and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing found at least 21 positive samples of the virus in wastewater samples in several surrounding counties, though there were no further confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows 92.5 percent of children in the US have had at least three doses of the polio vaccine. Children receive four total doses by age six, which protects them for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional doses may be given to adults traveling to high-risk countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends children and adult travelers to an at-risk region get a polio vaccine booster and wash their hands frequently to prevent polio from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 05:19:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZFpsOVcwN1RpNGpyYXFqdU9xdnV3Y3poUU9xQlI5M2JJYm1Sb3RTU2w3TWpybVp2OWl1a1dQbmhiMnY3b0ViWEhaZV9ZcEtMTjd2eW1nS3N3TUZNZFkyb0pOVE1BVDc4RmVMSFAwOGFneEJsRlhfZzRyQWRZWjVRTF9KRm9QSE1saHBIbUVmMHhsOWFpRjU0QUhtTXRaZlZBYl81V2JR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9fMjdTbWgzMkN6UGNmNUQxdmtva1VkY01XY0Y1MVVWT3lvb3h1b1RGQ1lhQzJBR3VUWjRHdE9yZm9GZ2pJV3ZlTTNqQWRLbWNxc2VNWHdFenVfRnVzNEVJNnk1MEJkcEdjNGpZa1YzR3lqdTQ3dXJ3NXhkeWlEUk90TnhUbVVFejVnSEE2aGIyck5mQlMxdEJHWVIzdi0xVmZIUmVZd2c0UnExVQ</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜真的有毒吗？ –播客-卫报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNYUVnY0lYM20tRDdCNXY3d2RnVFhxR2QtTW92MURrRDVzZGZlNFd5RXlqMS10OU5qdzVTNDZSNHdnSm1TazROdE1RNnV1RnJ3dk41d2FMTUtBc0xoRlBra3NSZG1sQ294YlZUbFhMQ1Q2SHRHbm5iZEdpUlFtLXFUa3Q3VUNfNFJkTzBjV0pfTE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNYUVnY0lYM20tRDdCNXY3d2RnVFhxR2QtTW92MURrRDVzZGZlNFd5RXlqMS10OU5qdzVTNDZSNHdnSm1TazROdE1RNnV1RnJ3dk41d2FMTUtBc0xoRlBra3NSZG1sQ294YlZUbFhMQ1Q2SHRHbm5iZEdpUlFtLXFUa3Q3VUNfNFJkTzBjV0pfTE4</guid></item><item><title>新研究证实减肥药物与突发性视力丧失有关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNZlJUTVNzR3RaRUdIdnVZMmRNak1pR1BCSDRfczZEemdObUNUTTZjNlRjb3dqZ09XUGdpQW1neUk5bUNtbEZyOEoyOV8tQUNEOGNaRWdtaGtaWmp3RmFuNi1IWWg4RzRoLXlaYlVhSnhfTktsNjlqWGxvRHFOek5jWHlHWDcxZFhleXFoYm9CYWR5eWFhaVFOSUJiXzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro (known as semaglutide and tirzepatide) have changed the way clinicians manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170960" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and obesity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists"&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1. This limits both hunger and interest in food, helping users lose weight, and helps control blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies published today show that people taking these drugs may have a small increased risk of serious eye conditions and vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-tentatively-linked-with-sudden-vision-loss-risk"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs 'Tentatively' Linked With Sudden Vision Loss Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know if you're taking or considering these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What damage can occur?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, is a rare but devastating eye condition that occurs when blood flow to the optic nerve is suddenly reduced or blocked. It's also called an "eye stroke".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of NAION remains unclear and there are no current treatments available. People with diabetes are at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076653"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other eye conditions that develop gradually, NAION causes a sudden, painless loss of vision. Patients typically notice the condition when they wake up and discover they've lost vision in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vision tends to worsen over a couple of weeks and slowly stabilises. Recovery of vision is variable, but around &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management"&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of people do not experience improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What has previous research shown?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous study from 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.2296"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; participants prescribed semaglutide for diabetes were four times more likely to develop NAION. For those taking it for weight loss, the risk was almost eight times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; concluded NAION represented a "very rare" side effect of semaglutide medications: a one in 10,000 chance. In a first for medicines regulators, the agency now requires product labels to include NAION as a documented risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the recent studies suggest the risks may be lower than we first thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to NAION, there is also evidence to suggest GLP-1 drugs can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141"&gt;worsen&lt;/a&gt; diabetic eye disease, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611"&gt;diabetic retinopathy&lt;/a&gt;. This occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg" alt="retina image" class="wp-image-170962 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Image of the retina, with blood vessels near the optic nerve. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEEjg34OEY/"&gt;olaaf/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound counter-intuitive, but rapid blood sugar reductions can also destabilise the fragile blood vessels in the retina and lead to bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do the new studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two newly published studies investigated people with type 2 diabetes living in the United States over two years. The studies looked at the medical records of 159,000 to 185,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26327"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found semaglutide or tirzepatide was associated with a more modest risk of developing NAION than previously thought. Of 159,000 people with type 2 diabetes who were taking these drugs, 35 people (0.04%) developed NAION, compared with 19 patients (0.02%) in the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found an increased risk of developing "other optic nerve disorders". However, it's unclear what kind of optic nerve disorders this includes, as the medical record codes used didn't specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter to this, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26321"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; did not find an increased risk of NAION among those taking GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers found a small increase in the number of people developing diabetic retinopathy in those prescribed GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall, participants on GLP-1 drugs experienced fewer sight-threatening complications related to their diabetic retinopathy and required less invasive eye treatments compared to the group taking other diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are still needed to understand how GLP-1 drugs can lead to eye complications. A current, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03811561"&gt;five-year clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is studying the long-term effects of semaglutides and diabetic eye disease in 1,500 people, which should tell us more about the ocular risks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for people taking GLP-1 drugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAION is a serious condition. But we need to strike a balance between these (and other) &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/people-on-ozempic-may-have-fewer-heart-attacks-strokes-and-addictions-but-more-nausea-vomiting-and-stomach-pain-247683"&gt;risks and the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 medications in diabetes care, obesity treatment, reducing heart attack risks and extending lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key lies in informed decision-making and identifying different levels of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with multiple NAION risk factors – such as sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and diabetes – should undergo careful consideration with their treating doctor before starting these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg" alt="person holding weight loss drug" class="wp-image-170966 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642-600x348.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with risk factors for NAION should discuss their use of GLP-1 medications with their doctor. (David Petrus Ibars/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crowded" optic nerve heads are also a risk factor for NAION. This is an anatomical feature where blood vessels at the optic nerve head are tightly packed together. People with crowded optic nerve heads should also undergo careful consideration before starting GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although NAION can strike without warning, regular comprehensive eye examinations with your optometrist or ophthalmologist still serve important purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can detect other drug-related eye problems, including worsening diabetic retinopathy, and can identify patients with crowded optic nerve heads. It's also important to tell them if you are taking GLP-1 medications so they can keep a close watch on your eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-021-05522-4"&gt;Emerging research&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that improving your heart health might help reduce risks of developing NAION. This includes proper management of high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol – all conditions that compromise the small blood vessels feeding the optic nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13164670"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; also show patients with heart conditions who better adhere to their medication prescriptions have lower risks of NAION than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should discuss NAION risks during prescribing decisions and work with eye care providers to monitor regularly for diabetic eye disease. Patients need clear instructions to seek immediate medical attention for sudden vision loss and the need for regular eye examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggressive treatment of sleep apnoea and other heart conditions may also help reduce NAION risks. But for now, there remains an ongoing need for more research to understand how GLP-1 medications can affect the eye.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262874/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to 90 cases, including three deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600053b6nl44gsl77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The update comes days after New York City’s health department proposed &lt;a href="https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/RequestDetail/20250801026" target="_blank"&gt;new regulations&lt;/a&gt; for the testing of cooling towers, which they suspect are linked to the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600063b6nh54s6bxl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cooling towers are rooftop devices that release mist into the air as they cool large buildings. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella bacteria can grow and infect people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600073b6n5e8i90z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Department of Health spokesperson told CNN the proposed rules “were in development well before the Legionnaires’ cluster in Central Harlem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600083b6n9ksg0af1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under New York City law, building owners are responsible for registering and maintaining their cooling towers and they’re routinely inspected for compliance. The proposal would set specific time periods for testing and require test sampling be conducted by state-certified labs. It also details monetary penalties for noncompliance, although the posted documents didn’t specify amounts. Currently, building owners who fail to follow routine maintenance rules &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodelibrary.amlegal.com%2Fcodes%2Fnewyorkcity%2Flatest%2FNYCrules%2F0-0-0-97837&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164878258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=0%2F%2BxHWeOkliDcXUXNb4pi1Xde34H1LmfVCid19Q4aic%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;face fines&lt;/a&gt; of $500 to $2,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7saoi300003b6nph0ndfrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The proposed changes to testing and fines, however, may come with the challenge of enforcement — city data shows that the city conducted a record low number of inspections in 2024, with less than half the inspections of 2017, when inspection numbers were first recorded. The decline in inspections was first reported by &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2Fnews%2Flegionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164929123%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=FuzutEYOhzKptC%2F8%2F8m3FDG3m8BtplTb2CR%2BSdmSPqg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;.

            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Health officials say all operable cooling towers in the area have been tested, and those that tested positive for Legionella were ordered to be cleaned. The department said it confirmed that the required cleanings were carried out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbqkl000c3b6nwmvadji4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

In its &lt;a href="https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Novel-Entities.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, DSV established that these substances have much "potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Harry Macpherson, senior climate associate at DSV, noted that people are often shocked by how unmonitored the issue truly is, and went on to provide an alarmingly relatable example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Maybe people think that when you walk down the street breathing the air; you drink your water, you eat your food; you use your personal care products, your shampoo, cleaning products for your house, the furniture in your house; a lot of people assume that there's really great knowledge and huge due diligence on the chemical safety of these things. But it really isn't the case," Macpherson said, per the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is DSV's report so concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Macpherson wasn't wrong — even &lt;span&gt;diligent consumers&lt;/span&gt; who take steps to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic&lt;/a&gt; or other potential contaminants often can't rely on manufacturers' disclosures for everything from what's in our kitchens to how objects might adversely impact household health and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;DSV's review noted that novel entities evade detection, emphasizing "critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research, and testing methods" to quantify the vast array of adverse impacts on humans — with particularly pronounced effects on reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The way that we've generally done the testing has meant that we've missed a lot of effects," Macpherson observed, and DSV's "Novel Entities: A Ticking Time Bomb" report bore that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Two million lives and 53 million disability-adjusted life-years … were lost in 2019 due to exposure to selected chemicals," it read, highlighting exposure to lead and occupational contamination as the "biggest drivers of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given the framing of the report, "nothing" appeared to be an unsettling answer to that conclusion, but Macpherson advocated for serious research and funding and a shockingly simple partial solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers "obviously don't want less funding" for climate research. "But this we think — really, proportionally — needs more attention," he added, before expressing some optimism about the potential for a straightforward, &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-initiatives-by-mainstream-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:consumer-driven fix;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;consumer-driven fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There isn't necessarily the need for a massive collective action; it can just be demand for safer products, because people want safer products," Macpherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec427MKqDcI8a21U" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 23:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQQkxOLVN6T29ONFY3WnliUHhhcjVDWEdZT3ZZY21EV3NJWTB0Z21pYUx0WHVacmFzTmR0aHNZUGlVRkNCWTlISm1Kd1lFQ042Y3pLX2o5Q1RLRHoyWi1UZ2g2VjQtMUZ6RU9nSGRiMFBmV1VpSlBwN2J0Mm9EVjQ5cHF4N0g4OGZVckJNdEpWRFZUQQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，成千上万患有前列腺癌的男性面临不必要的过度治疗-独立报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPQ2drRWdacy1TYXJPTXBqR1RvS0xSLVVRQlZ5eXJBREVaeVhMU3hHMnU2SDdqdER2LVI5bHJEZXdWWkI4WDFuRkMxMWR0OW9uVU9Eam1IbDdTbFV4ZkdmRVRzV3NUUW52cHZBNXF1YXNoSzRydkdhanlrMjZHRHNCNURMU0U1eVZiX0ZQV0doQmdZNHF0OEtjRGpIT3hYOVFxSE9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

But these guidelines have not been updated since 2021, and the Prostate Cancer UK argues they do not take into account advances in testing and diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vincent Gnanapragasam, professor of urology at the University of Cambridge, said: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Active surveillance is the best treatment option for men whose cancer is unlikely to progress or cause them problems in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But NICE’s outdated guidelines have created a deeply concerning wild west on how surveillance is implemented by different health care teams. This inconsistency is resulting in a lack of confidence from patients in surveillance, who may instead opt to have treatment they may not have ever needed, risking harmful side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fHfZpe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-353932"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Prostate Cancer UK)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the charity, overtreatment rates in England range from 2 to 24 per cent, and it warns that this results in a “postcode lottery” in which some men receive treatment unnecessarily while others receive monitoring as they should. It also found 35 hospitals have created their own guidelines on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis, 63, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020. The nurse, from Dudley, said&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“My doctors told me my cancer was ‘low-risk’ and not likely to spread quickly, so I was put on active surveillance until 2024, when my PSA level started to rise again, so I had surgery to remove my prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being on active surveillance meant I didn’t have to have treatment until I needed to. I was able to continue my everyday life with no side effects. I’m glad I was able to get treatment when I needed it, but having the time without it was so valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Thanks to advances in research, we can now tell which prostate cancers require immediate treatment, and which men would be better off being monitored with blood tests and scans – enabling them to delay treatment or even avoid treatment altogether.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the treatments for prostate cancer, such as radiotherapy or surgery, can lead to “life-changing side effects, like incontinence or erectile dysfunction, which can have a huge mental and physical impact on men”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NICE’s outdated guidance is increasing the likelihood of men experiencing these life-changing side effects,” she added. “It is causing confusion and inconsistency between hospitals in how active surveillance is implemented across England, leading to a postcode lottery of overtreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity is now repeating its call for Nice to update its guidance on active surveillance, claiming this could help up to 5,000 men a year avoid overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's National Screening Committee is currently assessing whether a national screening programme for prostate cancer should be rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NICE spokesperson said&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; “We are committed to ensuring our guidelines continue to reflect the best available evidence and give patients the best possible outcomes.

&lt;p&gt;New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reveals that women who regularly consume caffeinated coffee during midlife may have better chances of maintaining overall health into their senior years. This groundbreaking study tracked thousands of women over three decades, offering compelling evidence that your daily coffee ritual might contribute to long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The remarkable connection between coffee and women’s healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a significant link between coffee consumption in middle-aged women and enhanced health outcomes later in life. The extensive research, presented at NUTRITION 2025 (the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting), followed 47,513 female participants from the Nurses’ Health Study over 30 years, gathering comprehensive dietary and health information since 1984.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the unique aspect of this investigation: &lt;em&gt;examining coffee’s influence across multiple domains of aging over an extended timeframe&lt;/em&gt;. “While past studies have connected coffee to individual health outcomes, ours is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” Dr. Mahdavi explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee—approximately 2-5 cups daily—was associated with a 2% to 5% higher likelihood of healthy aging. This positive correlation was specific to regular caffeinated coffee, with no significant benefits observed from decaffeinated varieties or tea consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women classified as “healthy agers” typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during midlife (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. More than 80% of this caffeine came specifically from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What defines “healthy aging” in this landmark study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers established comprehensive criteria to identify women who achieved “healthy aging” status. By 2016, 3,706 participants had met all requirements. To qualify as a healthy ager, women needed to demonstrate excellence across multiple health domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching age 70 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Freedom from 11 major chronic diseases&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintained physical functionality&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Good mental health status&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No cognitive impairment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Absence of memory complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;holistic approach to measuring successful aging&lt;/strong&gt; represents one of the study’s most valuable contributions to our understanding of long-term health trajectories in women. Rather than focusing on single health metrics, the research team evaluated how coffee consumption related to maintaining overall wellbeing across physical, mental, and cognitive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis carefully controlled for potential confounding factors, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake—ensuring that the observed benefits could be reasonably attributed to caffeine consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not all caffeine sources offer equal benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crucial finding from this research highlights that &lt;strong&gt;the source of caffeine matters significantly&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to potential health benefits. While caffeinated coffee showed positive associations with healthy aging, the same cannot be said for all caffeine-containing beverages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Beverage Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Association with Healthy Aging&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Approximate Effect&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Caffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Positive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-5% increased likelihood per cup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Decaffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cola/Soda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-26% decreased likelihood per serving&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking was the discovery that regular cola consumption showed a decidedly negative relationship with healthy aging prospects. Each additional small glass of soda was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that &lt;em&gt;the beneficial effects appear specific to coffee rather than caffeine itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction suggests that coffee’s unique composition—beyond just its caffeine content—may contribute to its apparent health benefits. Coffee contains numerous bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that could work synergistically to support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical implications for women’s health strategies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these findings show promise, Dr. Mahdavi cautions that coffee consumption should be viewed as just one component within a broader healthy lifestyle framework. “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” she noted, adding that “moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that the benefits observed from coffee consumption were relatively modest compared to the impact of overall lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and avoiding tobacco use. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that incorporating moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee into daily routines may complement other health-promoting practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For middle-aged women concerned about maintaining their vitality and cognitive function into later years, this research offers encouraging evidence that your morning cup of coffee might do more than just jumpstart your day—it could potentially contribute to a healthier aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal nature of this study—following participants for three decades—provides particularly robust evidence for these associations, though further research remains necessary to fully understand the biological mechanisms involved and to determine whether similar benefits might extend to other demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

Voles lacking oxytocin receptors took up to a week to develop preferences for peers that normal voles formed in a day, and they often failed to prioritize known companions in group settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These receptor-deficient voles also pressed less to access a peer and were less avoidant of strangers, indicating reduced social selectivity. The findings highlight oxytocin’s dual role in fostering affiliation with trusted companions and reinforcing boundaries with outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond Formation Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin accelerates the development of selective friendships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Selectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Without oxytocin receptors, animals struggle to prioritize familiar peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Social Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin influences both closeness to friends and avoidance of strangers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new UC Berkeley study shows that the so-called love hormone, oxytocin, is also critical for the formation of friendships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released in the brain during sex, childbirth, breastfeeding and social interactions and contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112162"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg" alt="This shows friends talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in who they are social with, their selectivity,” she said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind that it’s also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the “cuddle” or “happy” hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They’ve shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or “social monogamy,” or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person’s ability to form or maintain social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it’s similar to and different from other types of relationships,” said Annaliese Beery, a UC Berkeley associate professor of integrative biology and neuroscience and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. Prairie voles that are close friends typically huddle side by side, groom and even sit on one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: ‘I prefer you to this stranger,’ for example,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The animals that didn’t have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments — they didn’t work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;they are social with, their selectivity,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain,” said Beery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published Aug. 8 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What social voles tell us about social humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery has long been interested in social relationships in rodents, focusing primarily on the animals’ seldom-studied peer or friendship relationships. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what’s species-specific versus generalizable across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding’s ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species — there are about 50 worldwide — to compare their social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we’ve tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. So there seems to be this widespread tendency to bond,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Someday, I hope to be able to tell you, ‘Do selective peer relationships precede the development of monogamy? Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?’ I think this familiarity preference is deeply rooted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while oxytocin isn’t essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or “null mutant”) prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles’ friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one, they tested how long it took for voles to establish a preference for a partner. Whereas normal voles take about 24 hours of close proximity to form a relationship that makes them choose that partner over a stranger, oxytocin receptor-deficient voles showed no preference in that amount of time, and took up to a week to establish a peer preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn’t required to have a relationship, but it’s really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. In such a situation, normal voles would hang out with known friends until they eventually started to socialize with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can all separate, they can all come together, or they can hang out in any combinations that they want,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It’s like if I went to a party with a friend, I would stand near that friend for the first part of the party and then I might start to mingle. The voles that lack oxytocin receptors just mixed. It was as if they didn’t even have a partner in there with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third experiment, they tested the strength of both peer and mate bonding by having the voles press levers to get access to either a friend/mate or a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, voles lacking oxytocin receptors were also less aggressive toward strangers and less avoidant of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can see contributions of oxytocin signaling to both sides of selectivity,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the prosocial side, it’s involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it’s aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. We’ve seen effects of oxytocin on both affiliation and aggression in our other studies in prairie voles, and it parallels human findings on a role of oxytocin in in-group/out-group dynamics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin nanosensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a new oxytocin sensor developed in Landry’s UC Berkeley lab to determine whether lack of an oxytocin receptor caused increases or decreases in oxytocin release. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry, an associate professor in the departments of chemical and biomolecular engineering, neuroscience, and molecular and cell biology and a co-corresponding author of the paper, created these sensors from carbon nanotubes joined with specific single-stranded DNA sequences selected because they latch onto the oxytocin molecule and fluoresce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles’ brains. In fact, oxytocin was being released in lower amounts from fewer sites in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for social reward across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Co-authors with Black, Komatsu, Beery, Landry and Manoli are Jiaxuan Zhao, Scarlet Taskey and Nicole Serrano of UC Berkeley, and Ruchira Sharma of UCSF.

Oxytocin receptor function also contributed to the maintenance of peer bonds, as &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles displayed reduced relationship stability and lost selective attachments rapidly in a multi-chamber, group-living habitat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles also showed deficits in general social reward as well as selective social reward for a peer partner over an unfamiliar conspecific. Evoked oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in male and female &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared with their wild-type counterparts, indicating that these voles do not have a compensatory increase in oxytocinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these data indicate that oxytocin receptors influence the formation, persistence, and reward value of peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:31:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1XTnZTSmY0LVczX2tNUVZUZEpheE9Sb1JGN3d6b29ZQXlKc3JuVi1rQUZHVmpLQnY4Ym5wTDEtWHExbmIwbExDUmtocDNFLXNNeUsyRE5zVi1neDZGcnVsOHB6dEdfYjlKbnJxdnNhbFo</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.被医学杂志抨击疫苗研究撤回请求- The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRmh5Mmo1YldGNkczN2E4TkJqSms4SHowYnFDS0hIR3B0M3NCRkpoNGg3TTZhcm5ad2xEYzQzZktuNzNVRlhZTlFPa0JzT1VFTks5YlBsNVVvSVljNnduTkxWTmZvN3kwVGhOUUUxOWFYdlBxWlFPeDNwRnVsTHRDUUJhWWpaa3pwZ2YwWjJIdUR0VVctRWVMc3duTEVJSlItVWFTQ1UzU09VcEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main-article" class=""&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The editor-in-chief of a prominent medical journal has rejected Robert F.

Above are workers spraying insecticide in Shenzhen, China, last week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;China's record-breaking outbreak is in Guangdong province, on the southern coast, with almost all the infections reported in the city of Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest update from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, revealed by the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ep.ycwb.com/epaper/ycwb/html/2025-08/11/content_2974_719894.htm"&gt;Yangcheng Evening News&lt;/a&gt;, officials reported that of the new cases, 1,212 were in Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 103 cases were reported in Guangzhou, the largest city in the province, while 39 cases were reported in Zhanjiang. It was not clear where the other 33 cases were within the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials heralded the figures as the lowest weekly count reported since the peak of the outbreak in the week to July 20 to 26, when they said they recorded 2,940 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement to DailyMail.com last week, a CDC spokesman said: 'CDC is aware of the reported chikungunya outbreak in Guangdong Province in China and is currently assessing the size and extent of the outbreak.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency has already issued a level two warning for the area, advising Americans to take advanced precautions when traveling to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Friday, Hong Kong said it had detected another two cases linked to the outbreak, taking its chikungunya tally to five infections reported this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the area in China where US travelers are being advised to take extra precautions because of the outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drones are being used to hunt down insect breeding grounds and spray insecticide (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One was a 66-year-old woman who was reported to have traveled to Foshan alone from July 24 to August 5 to see family, before returning to Hong Kong. The patient began suffering from fever, rash and joint pain on August 6 and went to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has now been discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reported another suspected case in a healthy 22-year-old woman who was suffering from joint pain and fever. She had recently traveled to Madagascar, Mauritius and Malaysia before returning to the territory, and reported having been bitten by mosquitoes during her trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also on Friday, Taiwan reported its first case linked to the outbreak in China, in a woman in her 40s who had recently returned from Foshan and Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A day after returning to Taiwan she developed a fever, rash and pain in her limbs. Officials said she was admitted to the hospital. She also reported being bitten by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya virus can only be spread via the bites of mosquitoes and cannot be passed from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People infected with the virus suffer from a sudden high fever, normally around 103 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), which happens within two to seven days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also suffer from a rash, headache, nausea, fatigue and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In serious cases, patients may suffer from pain in the hands and feet that is so bad it leaves them struggling to carry out normal activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is rarely fatal, but can leave people with lifelong complications including joint inflammation and pain that lasts for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who are very young, elderly or have underlying conditions are most at risk because of their weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for the virus, with doctors instead using over-the-counter painkillers, fluids and rest to ease symptoms. There are two vaccines available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US records more than 100 cases of chikungunya virus every year, with almost all normally linked to travelers returning from abroad before testing positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are concerned, however, that an infected individual could be bitten by a mosquito, which would then become infected and pass the disease on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A total of 45 chikungunya cases have been reported in the US this year, although none have been linked to the outbreak in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:02:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZFhZVDN1ZHdycDdBMTFqVDNQTTNNWlY3ZmI0X1pNc1dHQ05LRFQtOVNzbVNPWHJGSGdCRW5ONEhsSWxkWDFfTGQ5a0dYX1VNZzZCeE9weEdJS3VUTkdKMWJQeGlYblBHWWhhLUREanJQUDlJREVBbUtTck03Q29IVVFsUXhlMUUtRkpEX1RNenNsNDV4dnRwSTRYWmdQdlgydUtJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE5TS0dwUFlOZURqMm1SbzVNTkxUUlVIRmJQaUlubnN2MkNrdzA4TWVwM3ktamxJV1QxYVlKZnRRXzF3TDFxMllHejF5eXBiMVBFZlE0ODhFQTlVTERDOXBQVlFyX2M2clhVbzNfZTREM1pTM09MLXpaNG8zMnN4MVJLbHJfXzlUOGRMS1h4eHZaOTRuNEJ1QVJ4eGZMQW9fMU9jQTZmQ19icw</guid></item><item><title>创新系统无需加热即可脱水水果- Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTE1NeFlsdEpyZ1pHUXVLdVJrVkhGeERVQ0FMWjRzbXJrWGw4eHc1dE1PYjNfZXk3OHhoak1Ra2pULUIyMDRTYTc1X21PZzg4VS1WUERNSjd6RFVYTDBrbXI3LQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dried fruit is a tasty snack or sweet addition to recipes, but the water removal process often requires heat and energy. In a step toward more sustainable food preservation, researchers reporting in &lt;i&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/i&gt; have &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.5c00534" target="_blank"&gt;developed a method&lt;/a&gt; for drying food at room temperature by adjusting air pressure conditions and using food-safe calcium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a proof-of-concept, the system successfully dried mango and apple slices to commercial levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydrating food turns perishable items such as fruit into long-lasting pantry staples. Most tabletop and industrial-scale food dehydrators use circulated hot air to remove moisture, which is simple and effective but requires a lot of energy. Sun-drying foods uses mostly solar energy but is slow and darkens the final products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Luis Bastarrachea is &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.2c00433" target="_blank"&gt;developing food preservation processes that don't require heat&lt;/a&gt;. In this most recent study, the moisture-adsorbing salt &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/calcium/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; chloride, an ingredient used in cheese and molecular gastronomy applications, was incorporated into a room-temperature dehydration method and tested to see if it would impact the drying fruit's color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built a no-heat dehydrating chamber with three sets of screens above a container of calcium chloride solution. They placed mango and apple slices on the screens and then compared two room-temperature drying methods: one with the chamber at standard air pressure and the other under a slight vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figcaption&gt;            &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four days under standard air pressure, the calcium chloride solutions drew out and adsorbed less moisture from the fruits than those placed under vacuum. The fruit slices at standard air pressure also dried inconsistently. Slices on the top screen contained 50–70% water (by weight) and those on the bottom had 20–30% water after the dehydration process.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the vacuum-assisted method produced consistently dried mango and apple pieces made up of about 30% moisture, which is similar to the amount in commercially available dried fruit, and represented a removal of approximately 95% of the initial water mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacuum-dried mango pieces kept the raw fruit's attractive bright yellow color; however, the two dehydration methods darkened the apples by similar amounts. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images showed the breakdown of starch granules in all the samples, but more of them broke down under standard pressure, suggesting that the vacuum-assisted method slows down deterioration mechanisms and retains freshness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water pulled out of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fruit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; could potentially be reused. Bastarrachea says that "the collected water in the calcium chloride solution can be removed by evaporation, and the reconcentrated calcium &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/chloride/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chloride&lt;/a&gt; solution can be reutilized in more dehydration cycles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the recovered water could be used in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/industrial+applications/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;industrial applications&lt;/a&gt; or further treated for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific papers as well as interviews with researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, the researchers found the food and agricultural industries to be the worst offenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute water and affect local ecosystems as well as the food we eat, and one of the most dangerous fertilizers is the sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants which is spread on fields even though it often contains many toxic chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that PFAS have now 'contaminated the whole world', with levels in rainwater often exceeding safe limits for drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern as research has shown they can infiltrate cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They note that despite the current level of evidence, there are still 'noticeable gaps' in how industry and regulatory bodies address chemical toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, they highlight how loopholes in regulation have allowed more than 200 new food additives into the food system without undergoing pre-market approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reveals that the number is closer to 900 and these additives get through the system through what is referred to as the 'generally recognized as safe,' or GRAS, loophole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The loophole lets those companies – not the FDA – decide when a substance is safe,' the expose notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'For the other 863 new food chemicals added to the food supply since 2000, food chemical companies exploited the GRAS loophole so they could make their own safety determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Deep Science Ventures report reveals that in the FDA's own database, almost 80 percent of chemical additives directly added to food 'lack the relevant information needed to estimate the amount that consumers can safely eat, and 93 percent lack reproductive or developmental toxicity data.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And of the FDA-regulated additives - both directly and indirectly allowed in food - almost two-thirds don't have publicly available data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the EU, even with a 'precautionary ethos, typically based on the 'no hazard data, no market' principle', they say there are still too many exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The majority of commonly used chemicals lack adequate public data for their long-term health and environmental impacts,' they add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the backs of the findings, the researchers called for policy makers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Underscoring the need for immediate action, the researchers concluded: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives.

like heroin that have been contaminated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Infant botulism&lt;/strong&gt; – when a baby swallows a tiny germ spore from things like dirty soil or honey.

														&lt;p&gt;Marijuana users have “superior performance across multiple cognitive domains,” according to a new large-scale study funded by the U.S. federal government, with the effects of cannabis on cognition “presented concurrently across a range of brain systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published this month as a preprint by Nature Portfolio, analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from 37,929 participants in the United Kingdom aged between 44 and 81 years old. The team found that cannabis consumers consistently outperformed non-users on a range of cognitive tests—suggesting that marijuana use may be linked to brain network patterns typically observed in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that cannabis use may be associated with a deceleration of neural aging processes and the preservation of cognitive function in older adults,” the paper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We speculate that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may exert neuroprotective effects during aging by preserving an optimal balance between functional segregation and integration—an essential feature for maintaining specialized processing and efficient information transfer across brain networks,” wrote the researchers, who are from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, Georgia State University, University of Colorado, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6977015/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants, noted that as marijuana laws evolve and societal attitudes shift, researchers are uncovering a more complex picture of the drug’s effects, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalization, increased permissiveness, and recognition of therapeutic potential have contributed to a marked rise in marijuana consumption among the study population, the authors said. They pointed out that older adults now represent the fastest-growing group of cannabis users, increasingly using it to manage chronic physical and mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis users exhibited superior performance across multiple cognitive domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain undergoes significant physiological changes with age, and the study underscored the importance of understanding how cannabis interacts with these processes.  The researchers cautioned, however, that “the effects of marijuana in older adults may differ significantly from those observed in younger populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address gaps in previous research around marijuana’s effects on aging, the research team utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques on a vast dataset, which included brain scans and cognitive assessments from tens of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that cannabis users demonstrated brain network “characteristics typically associated with younger brains, along with enhanced cognitive abilities, highlighting a potential modulatory role for cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in neurodegenerative processes,” potentially supporting cognitive resilience. These benefits were noted from midlife into the late 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use may confer neurocognitive benefits in older adults by modulating the organization of functional brain networks,” they speculated. “The observed effects imply that cannabinoids may exert neuroprotective influences in aging populations, potentially through their regulatory roles in maintaining or enhancing functional brain segregation and integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s large scale has the potential to make it a landmark contribution to the field of marijuana and aging research, though the team emphasized that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, a study published last year found that marijuana use is associated with lower odds of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with people who consume cannabis for recreational or medical purposes &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-consumers-have-significantly-decreased-odds-of-cognitive-decline-study-finds/"&gt;reporting less confusion and memory loss compared to non-users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study in 2023 examining marijuana’s neurocognitive effects found that “&lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/study-finds-no-evidence-that-medical-marijuana-causes-cognitive-impairment-in-patients-with-chronic-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prescribed medical cannabis may have minimal acute impact on cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; among patients with chronic health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the long-term effects of cannabis use are far from settled science, findings from a number of recent studies suggest some fears have been overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report published in April that drew on dispensary data, for instance, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-helps-cancer-patients-think-more-clearly-and-manage-pain-study-using-cannabis-from-dispensaries-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;cancer patients reported being able to think more clearly when using medical marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. They also said it helped manage pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study of teens and young adults at risk of developing psychotic disorders found that regular &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/young-people-at-risk-of-psychosis-saw-symptoms-surprisingly-improve-with-marijuana-use-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana use over a two-year period did not trigger early onset of psychosis symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—contrary to the claims of prohibitionists who argue that cannabis causes mental illness. In fact, it was associated with modest improvements in cognitive functioning and reduced use of other medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another study published by the American Medical Association (AMA) last year that looked at data from more than 63 million health insurance beneficiaries determined that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-legalization-not-associated-with-increased-rates-of-psychosis-american-medical-association-study-of-63-million-people-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;there’s “no statistically significant increase” in psychosis-related diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; in states that have legalized marijuana compared to those that continue to criminalize cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from 2018, meanwhile, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/smoking-marijuana-actually-improves-working-memory-study-indicates/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana may actually increase working memory&lt;/a&gt; and that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-use-doesnt-actually-change-the-structure-of-your-brain-new-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;doesn’t actually change the structure of the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s more complicated and more exciting. It’s a constant process of exploration. An adventure into the unknown. Scientists come up with theories about what might be going on, and then test them. They don’t always get it right. Far from it. But inch by inch, testing, failing and trying again, they make progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate confirmation &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearingto-consider-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hearings&lt;/a&gt; for the role of secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"commentisfree","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"Blog","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/coronavirus-outbreak","type":"Keyword","title":"Coronavirus"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"business/pharmaceuticals-industry","type":"Keyword","title":"Pharmaceuticals industry"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/editorials","type":"Tone","title":"Editorials"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"profile/editorial","type":"Contributor","title":"Editorial"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/opinion","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Letters and Leader Writers"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"commentisfree/2025/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-rfk-jrs-vaccine-cuts-an-assault-on-science-from-a-politician-unfit-for-his-office","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cutting&lt;/a&gt; $500m of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact, no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which many &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Could-Bird-Flu-Be-the-Next-Global-Pandemic.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; could trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Either Mr Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable. The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, and &lt;a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-measles-vaccines-are-important-but-government-mandates-are-not-the-answer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mandating&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with many people known to have sceptical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mr Kennedy is particularly hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, &lt;a href="https://publichealthcollaborative.org/alerts/false-claims-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-the-most-deadly-vaccines-in-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panning&lt;/a&gt; them in 2021 as the “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2022-01-24/ty-article/.premium/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-vaccine-mandates-harder-to-escape-than-nazi-persecution/0000017f-dc44-d3a5-af7f-feee56c50000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; mandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to vaccinate billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19. They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor countries. The inventors &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/scientists-whose-work-enabled-mrna-covid-vaccine-win-nobel-prize-for-medicine-katalin-kariko-drew-weissman" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;won the Nobel prize in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mr Kennedy’s cancellation of funding not only stymies much research but also feeds worldwide doubt in mRNA vaccines. We are all the losers. Humanity needs these vaccines. Other countries need to step up with money and reassurance to try to heal this latest breach between science and nonsense. And Mr Kennedy is clearly unfit for the job he holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 18:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQV2EzODIxSEl5OWtyRmozdlRqQnZZNG5adk8yc1c2Rkh0TDd0eVF0U2VfTG9GTFdRTzZDU0hsbGE3ZXBiQ2tIcWhkWXBadFcwRm9ZVU8wTFBabWswVU1TcHFOX2VvZmdMV3Z5SVpvR3MxOUpFR2xqaVdRT2ZxTUo5RlAtakJPaDl1bUU3M05VUGVwQS1Uc055WmJ1c0dkRmRmZ3NMWGxWMTdJQ0R1Y0hGa1VlWk5JNVZuc3p0a2haQmVHQ2xtR1BDODNyRklYanM1MjlxUzdHYmkwUUc0LWN6OU5xMWdmVVQxTjRuSg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，在海螺壳中吹气有助于治疗睡眠呼吸暂停患者的危险打鼾症状-好消息网络</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQU1p0OURkWmh6THRMUlZBak9CTXFheXJuVXdjdTVlZU9GYlNPSnNQbVdCR2NMeTZNRWZ5Uy0wS1J3a3RUZDY5NWhoUXlfZnJOanBYdWd6R3pONUFVa3Q5bHY2bC10ak04bUlQOVk4dWVnY3FKT0Y4R2l1Zk85am9WQUtyV2lxaV9XUERtZmMwTGNaV1pPOEJ4ZDFoRzFXVWJGeVVxSlpNTzFQUkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blowing through a conch shell could help treat a potentially deadly snoring condition, according to new research from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who took part in the ancient practice regularly for six months experienced a significant reduction in their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common sleep disorder where breathing stops repeatedly during the night due to a blocked airway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to loud snoring, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness, and can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowing the conch shell, called shankh blowing, has been part of Indian culture for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2025/06/05/2312054100258-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in the&lt;/a&gt; European Respiratory Society’s ERJ Open Research, showed that people with moderate OSA who practiced shankh blowing slept better and felt more alert during the day, but most importantly had fewer breathing interruptions at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team determined that conch blowing— a traditional yogic breathing exercise where you exhale sharply through a conch shell—could reduce the need for medication or machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the standard treatment for OSA is a ‘continuous positive airway pressure machine’, or CPAP, which keeps the patient’s airway open by blowing air through a face mask throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently,” said study leader Dr. Krishna K. Sharma, of the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his clinical practice, several patients used the shankh-blowing method and reported feeling more rested and experiencing fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These observations led us to design a scientific study to rigorously test whether this simple, ancient practice could serve as a meaningful therapy for people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 30 participants with moderate OSA, aged between 19 and 65, who were assessed at the Research Institute between 2022 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were tested with polysomnography, meaning they were monitored throughout a night’s sleep. They were also asked questions about the quality of their sleep and how sleepy they feel during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were randomly assigned to either be trained to practice blowing through a conch shell or a deep breathing exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the first group were provided with a traditional shankh used in yoga, and were trained at the clinic before beginning home-based practice requiring a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week. The patients were then reassessed after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the people who practiced deep breathing, the people who practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the daytime. They also reported sleeping better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4-5 Fewer Apneas Per Hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysomnographs revealed that they had on average four to five fewer apneas per hour—where breathing stops during sleep. They also had higher levels of oxygen in their blood during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive,” explained Dr. Sharma. “It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The conch’s unique spiraling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people living with OSA, especially those who find the CPAP face masks uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, the study offers a promising alternative that is simple and low-cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team noted that this is a small study, but they are now “planning a larger trial involving several hospitals”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels and sleep in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sophia Schiza, head of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) group on sleep disordered breathing, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still need for new treatments,” said the professor at the University of Crete, in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscles training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

But nitazenes are so potent that Narcan isn’t as effective as it is against a heroin overdose, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the influx of fentanyl, and now nitazenes, is that it’s easier to smuggle in smaller, but more potent drugs, U.K. National Crime Agency Deputy Director Charles Yates told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “They buy potent nitazenes cheaply and mix them with bulking agents such as caffeine and paracetamol to strengthen the product being sold and make significant profits,” Yates told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowder Funeral Home&lt;/p&gt; Lucci's mom is speaking out after her son died from a pill laced with nitazene.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's commonly mixed into pills and powders, a man in Sydney was arrested on Aug. 5 for selling vapes that were "supercharged" with the drug, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/06/sydney-vapes-nitazene-synthetic-opioid-ntwnfb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Guardian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.

&lt;p&gt;The agency’s director, Jay Bhattacharya, made the statement during an appearance on right-wing provocateur Steve Bannon’s podcast, “War Room,” that &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-4696-the-mainstreams-destruction-of-public-health/id1485351658?i=1000721307609" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;aired on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. His rationale for the cancellation of the contracts does not align with the explanation offered last week by his boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt;said vaccines made using this platform were not effective and were unsafe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH director, who came to national prominence during the pandemic as a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration — a policy statement urging the U.S. government to lift Covid containment measures — said the declining uptake of Covid boosters signals that the public isn’t willing to be immunized with mRNA-based vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as public health goes, the mRNA platform for vaccines is no longer viable,” Bhattacharya said. “You can’t have a platform where such a large fraction of the population distrusts the platform, if you’re going to use it for vaccines, and expect it to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been among the most prominent figures in the U.S. voicing distrust of the vaccines, long before he became the U.S. secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, called Bhattacharya’s comment “disingenuous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies have argued — despite scientific evidence — that the vaccines are not safe and effective, and “that message that they’re selling is one of the major reasons why there is potential public reluctance,” Osterholm told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya confirmed it was Kennedy’s decision to terminate the contracts that had been issued by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.  BARDA is the HHS division responsible for developing medical countermeasures for natural and bioterror threats. In May, BARDA also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;rescinded $766 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; to Moderna for work the vaccine manufacturer was doing to develop, test, and bring through licensure several vaccines for flu viruses that could trigger pandemics.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Bannon podcast, Bhattacharya said that, in his view, the mRNA vaccine platform is “promising but not yet ready for prime time for vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Billions of people around the world have been vaccinated with mRNA-based vaccines since the first two vaccines for Covid — Cominarty, made by the Pfizer and BioNTech partnership, and Spikevax, made by Moderna — went into use in December 2020. Other vaccines made using different production approaches eventually came to market. But a substantial portion of Covid vaccine doses administered in the intervening years were made using mRNA and widely credited with saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya reiterated a concern sometimes espoused by critics of mRNA vaccines that relates to the fact that the shots trigger the body to produce the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby training the immune system to recognize it and produce antibodies to attack the virus in the case of infection. Critics of the vaccines argue it isn’t possible to know how much antigen — the protein the immune system is being introduced to — these vaccines generate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For vaccines, what you want is a technology where you understand the dose of the antigen being given,” he said. When “you have a platform like the mRNA platform, what you’re doing essentially [is] you’re turning your body into an antigen factor. You’re taking your cells, which are capable of taking the mRNA programming, and turn out an antigen that you want to be produced there.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, said the concern Bhattacharya raised is also true in the case of another type of vaccine, those made using live but weakened viruses. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, the rotavirus vaccine, and the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that the mRNA is destroyed shortly after vaccination,” said Hensley, who is working to develop a universal flu vaccine using mRNA technology. “It is difficult to quantify the amount of antigen produced by the vaccine, but this is an issue that has already been addressed in vaccinology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Bhattacharya might not realize that a lot of human vaccines are based on live-attenuated viruses, where we similarly cannot definitively quantify antigen amounts produced in [recipients],” he said. “This is why we complete human clinical studies before vaccines are widely used in humans. The mRNA and live attenuated vaccine platforms have both proven to be safe and effective in clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya also noted that Covid vaccines made using mRNA do not prevent infection; he said he contracted Covid for the first time two months after getting vaccinated. In fact, this is true about all Covid vaccines — none permanently block infection — and about vaccines that protect against influenza as well. The vaccines, which are made using a variety of production platforms, do, however,  lower the risk of severe infection that would lead to hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We would all love a vaccine that prevents infections altogether, but keeping people alive and out of the hospital during a pandemic is pretty darn good,” Hensley said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The prospect that mRNA technology could be improved is a rationale for further investment in research, not abandonment of this production method, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should try to improve the mRNA platform by investing in mRNA vaccine research. If we continue to invest in this platform, in 5-10 years we will likely be able to develop vaccines that elicit broader responses and better mucosal responses that prevent infections,” Hensley said in an email. “Now is the time to continue to develop this platform so that we can be ready to respond to the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Now she's forced to only use the drug as a 'last resort'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Mendez (pictured), former psychotherapist in Indiana, said a steroid injection gave her symptoms of 'mania' within days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When taken at high doses or for extended periods, corticosteroids can interfere with the balance of certain brain chemicals, potentially leading to an increased likelihood of symptoms of depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability or even mania or psychosis,' Dr Jeffrey Ditzell, lead psychiatrist at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jeffditzellpsychiatry.com/"&gt;Dr Ditzell Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pain throughout the body by mimicking the effects of cortisol, a 'stress hormone' released by the adrenal glands to regulate inflammation, by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suppress the immune system, which triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are different from anabolic steroids - synthetic forms of testosterone often used as performance-enhancing drugs by athletes - and generally treat autoimmune conditions, allergic reactions and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a pharmacist, I see these medications used for anything from a sore throat to a skin rash to asthma to an unknown condition that involves the immune system,' Dr Erika Gray, pharmacist and founder and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.toolboxgenomics.com/"&gt;ToolBox Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids usually come as pills but can also be taken as injections, via ear and eye ingestion or as intravenous infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prednisone in particular is thought to disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which coordinates the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal glands, all of which regulate the body's stress response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dysregulation can send stress hormones like cortisol into overdrive, contributing to mood swings and symptoms of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Long term corticosteroid use can also cause the memory section of our brain to decrease in size which can negatively affect our memory and mood,' Dr Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A great way to think about the effect of corticosteroids on the brain is this medication makes your brain feel it is under constant stress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone with about 18 million prescriptions per year (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mendez, a former psychotherapist and mental health author, was given an injection of the corticosteroid Kenalog, a brand name for triamcinolone, in 2023 for shoulder pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within a day of getting this steroid injection, I started to experience hypomanic symptoms. I had been stable previously,' Mendez, who has bipolar disorder, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I called my psychiatrist, who increased my medication dose for bipolar disorder. Despite this, I developed severe mania and was hospitalized shortly after. The onset of hypomania/mania coincided with the steroid injection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital told Mendez the steroid injection likely triggered the hypomania, a less severe form of mania that causes extreme mood and energy changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of this, and the fact that I live with bipolar, steroids will be a last resort for me in the future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TikTok user, Amanda Powell, said prednisone made her feel like she was 'losing' her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw therapist after psychiatrist over and over and over again and nothing was going right. They prescribed me depression and anxiety medication and it just made my mania worse,' she said in a recent video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The crazy thing is people never associate prednisone with mania.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video posted earlier this year, Powell said, 'The side effects aren't worth the journey sometimes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell said prednisone in particular is most commonly associated with depression, irritability and mania at high doses, while its counterpart dexamethasone may increase the risk of sleep disruptions along with mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said oral corticosteroids are most likely to cause depression and other mood issues. These include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained inhaled versions of the drugs have a 'lower risk of mood effects due to low systemic absorption' while topical creams have a 'very low risk of systemic mood side effects unless used over large areas for long periods'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also said 'using topical hydrocortisone for long periods of time and over a large part of the body' could increase the risk of systemic absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell believes the risk of depression is highest with bigger doses - over 40 milligrams per day - over longer periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilary Hodge (pictured) told the Daily Mail while she is normally 'mellow', steroids make her moods drastically shift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women and older patients may also be at a greater risk due to having more hormone fluctuations and general sensitivity to medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk of depression and mood changes can be managed and, in some cases, lowered or prevented with using the lowest effective dose of the medication for the shortest duration of time,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The use of local instead of systemic steroids when possible is recommended. For example, for asthma, allergies or eczema, inhaled, nasal or topical steroids are often safer than oral medications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggests tapering the dose slowly, which means gradually decreasing it over time before stopping. This helps minimize any effects from sudden dosage changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also advised against quitting cold turkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never stop corticosteroids medication suddenly or without your prescribers help. These medications need to be slowly decreased over time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts urged those taking corticosteroids to keep a close eye on potential side effects and seek medical attention immediately if they notice drastic changes in mood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While taking corticosteroids, it is important to take immediate action if you experience suicidal thoughts or urges, if you feel out of control, or experience intense agitation or paranoia. Call a crisis line, reach out to a mental health professional, or go to the ER,' Dr Ditzell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These symptoms are rare, but serious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:11:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPd3lORm16d0NfMFEyMC1nUEVoUkwtZlZxYkI2bEpiOGczcjBmM1VlSElMaHRUUC1KRXZYeGg5Q29UdDlqalNPS3JQR0wyYUhZeWhGLUtpc0dtMHg1emF1Uk1DZlplZTd2eHVKOG80YUxwY091UF8xOE1PeUh4VFM4Y0ZvUTRfM2ZMZi12T0U3ekwzTk45cFVQWXZBdkMweW1yZVE</guid></item><item><title>在全国范围内召回了超过11,000瓶血压药物- SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QL2XDJVVLNBBJBOZ25RL5Q5OOM"&gt;More than 11,000 bottles of a popular blood pressure medication distributed nationwide has been recalled, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2GS7KSUQSVARVIBVBRAP3JZGKE"&gt;The recall involves bottles of Spironolactone Tablets, USP, 25 mg, 100-count — manufactured by Frontida BioPharm, Inc., and distributed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3VJLOC64MJBADF7JYSEPOO5ECY"&gt;The medication could contain the presence of foreign substance, identified as aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LUDTGSMTN5BGZF2OGULSNCN5XM"&gt;The medication under recall includes bottles with a lot number of P3314 and an expiration date of Nov. 30, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P6OL5WSQPBDR7AOWVVWLIJQNCY"&gt;The bottles were distributed nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JKM2ECFDLFHDDJNFXJMQMDOBHU"&gt;The recall was initiated on Aug. 5, and was classified to a Class II risk level on Aug. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R6TU5BKHRNCHVDVGABJCOV2EUE"&gt;A Class II recall is a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6BCMLHVXGBA6NBZO7UCZXN4IVI"&gt;The recall remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY" data-fusion-component="YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY" data-fusion-component="YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DJ2D4TPV6JGONPKPZJINZ43OZI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say beans are the most underrated ingredient for weight loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans are packed with protein and fiber to keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also help with weight loss by supporting gut health and managing blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No one has to tell you that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss can feel challenging&lt;/a&gt; for so many reasons.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we wish there were a magic solution, dietitians agree that one of the best things you can do is to choose foods that have actually been shown to help with weight loss. Like beans. “Beans are the unsung heroes of weight management,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewhemler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Drew Hemler, M.Sc., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re inexpensive, versatile and loaded with a trio of fiber, protein and slow-digesting carbs that keep you full longer while curbing cravings.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out why beans are our MVP ingredient for weight loss, plus quick, tasty ways to add them to your favorite meals and snacks.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Low in Calories, Yet Big on Volume  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are relatively low in calories but high in volume, thanks to their fiber and water content,” says Hemler. “That means you can eat a satisfying portion that fills you up without overloading on calories, which is an ideal combo for anyone trying to lose or manage weight.” For instance, 1 cup of canned black beans contains just 220 calories. At the same time, they’re 75% water, which pumps up their volume.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though beans are low in calories, they pack a slew of vitamins and minerals, making them nutritional superstars. &lt;a href="http://nutritionstarringyou.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, points out that beans, like black, kidney, white, garbanzo and pinto beans, also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;provide potassium&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that we need for healthy blood pressure, yet most of us fall short of. So, in addition to helping with weight loss, they also fill in an important nutrition gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Packed with Protein and Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dynamic weight-loss duo of protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;. “The protein, slowly digestible starches and soluble fiber in beans help slow gastric emptying and regulate blood sugar, and as a result, reduce hunger-driven cravings,” says Hemler. And when you feel full, you’re a lot less likely to mindlessly munch, which may help you eat fewer calories. Their combo of protein and fiber is so powerful that one study found that people who ate roughly 1 cup of beans per day had a lower body mass index and body weight and smaller waist size compared to people who didn’t usually eat beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all beans differ slightly, 1 cup of canned black beans gives you a whopping 17 grams of fiber and 15 grams of protein. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Enhance Gut Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just keep your digestive system running smoothly. It’s also a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7922773/best-way-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;key player in long-term weight management&lt;/a&gt;, helping manage appetite and blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly eating beans helps keep your gut bacteria in tip-top shape, which may translate to easier weight loss, says Harris-Pincus. That’s because beans are rich in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hard-to-digest carbohydrate called resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;. After you eat, say, a bowl of bean chili, the resistant starch from the beans travels to your gut. When it gets there, your gut good bacteria gobble it up for food. As they do this, they produce helpful compounds, called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), linked to lower body weight, a reduced risk of obesity and lower blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Promote Healthier Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly one-third of U.S. adults are living with prediabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just increase the risk of diabetes, it’s also a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899465/8-sneaky-reasons-you-could-be-gaining-weight-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sneaky cause of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. Prediabetes often begins with a silent condition called insulin resistance, which can disrupt your ability to maintain a healthy weight. Trouble is, health care providers don’t usually test for insulin resistance. So, many of us have it without even knowing it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating beans might just help protect against insulin resistance and the weight gain that comes along with it. “The plant-based protein and fiber in beans can aid in blood sugar control as well as increasing satiety to help people lose or maintain weight,” says Harris-Pincus. “Beans also contain antioxidants, which clinical studies have shown may reduce insulin resistance, aiding weight management.” In addition to protein and fiber, beans contain antioxidant-rich substances called saponins, which have been shown to lower blood sugar and protect against insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are incredibly versatile, working well in both sweet and savory dishes. And using canned beans can help you make mealtime magic happen in no time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts unanimously agree that weight loss doesn’t happen overnight. It’s really about the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-i-lost-110-pounds-8773037" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small, sustainable changes&lt;/a&gt; that can add up over time. Like adding beans to your day. “Including beans, lentils and chickpeas regularly in the diet is associated with numerous health benefits, including healthy weight maintenance, gut health and risk reduction for several chronic diseases,” says Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are big in volume, yet low in calories and are loaded with filling fiber and protein. They may also support weight loss by keeping your gut bacteria happy and healthy and improving your body’s ability to use insulin. “Beans aren’t just good for your waistline; they’re great for your wallet, gut and the planet, too,” says Hemler. “Whether you’re going meatless or just adding more plants, beans bring big benefits in a small, humble package.” Plus, they’re incredibly versatile. Whether you like them in dips, tacos, chili, soup, enchiladas or even smoothies or dessert, there are loads of good reasons to pop open a can!

&lt;p&gt;The Ripley County Health Department, along with the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH), set mosquito traps this time of year and test the bugs for various things, including West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Officer Dr. David Welsh says there are no confirmed human cases of West Nile Virus in Ripley County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds there are steps you take to cut down on mosquitos and the risk of contracting West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include get rid of breeding grounds by eliminating standing water; using bug repellant spray when outside and using wearing long sleeve shirts, particularly in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other thing is, if you get mosquito bites and your body does not respond you’d normally expect, you need to get it checked out,” Dr. Welsh said.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, replacing any form of potatoes with whole grains was associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk, but swapping them for white rice was linked to an increased risk, the results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potatoes contain several nutrients including fiber, vitamin C, and magnesium, but they also have a high starch content and therefore a high glycemic index, so have been linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither the preparation method for potatoes nor specific foods that potatoes would replace have been considered, both of which are key to evaluating the overall health impact of potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, researchers investigated the association between intake of potatoes prepared by different methods (boiled, baked, or mashed versus French fries) and risk of type 2 diabetes. They also looked at the impact on health of replacing potatoes with other major carbohydrates, such as whole grains and rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings are based on more than 205,000 health professionals from three large US studies carried out between 1984 and 2021. Participants were free of diabetes, heart disease or cancer and completed detailed food questionnaires every four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During almost 40 years of follow up, 22,299 people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors related to diabetes risk, the researchers found that for every three weekly servings of total potato, the rate of type 2 diabetes increased by 5% and for every three weekly servings of French fries, the rate increased by 20%. However, similar intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with a significantly increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing three weekly servings of total potato with whole grains lowered the type 2 diabetes rate by 8%. Substituting baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with whole grains lowered the rate by 4%, and replacing French fries lowered the rate by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, replacing total potatoes or baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with white rice was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. Most participants were also health professionals of European ancestry, so findings may not apply to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our findings underscore that the association between potato intake and type 2 diabetes risk depends on the specific foods used as replacement. The findings also align with current dietary recommendations that promote the inclusion of whole grains as part of a healthy diet for the prevention of type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are potatoes back on the plate? Well, it depends, say researchers in a linked editorial, who note that it is important to consider preparation method and replacement food when guiding the public or informing policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point out that with their relatively low environmental impact and their health impact, baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes can be part of a healthy and sustainable diet, though whole grains should remain a priority, but say future studies from more diverse populations that account for both preparation methods and substitution analysis are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

None had cancer at the outset. Their diet was recorded in detail and their health tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Overall the results showed that vegetarians had a 12 per cent lower risk of developing cancer than meat eaters in the same community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The biggest reductions were for colorectal cancer (21 per cent lower risk), stomach cancer (45 per cent lower), and lymphoproliferative cancers such as &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-lymphoma-the-uks-fifth-most-common-cancer-ln5kt6g7c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt; (25 per cent lower).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Analysing the&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; data by diet type showed further patterns. Vegans, who eat no animal products, had the largest overall reduction in cancer risk: 24 per cent lower than meat eaters. This included lower rates of breast cancer and, in younger men, prostate cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lacto-ovo vegetarians, who eat dairy and eggs, showed protection against some blood cancers. Pesco-vegetarians or pescatarians, who eat fish but no other meat, had notably fewer colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The differences between vegetarians and meat eaters were not limited to diet. On average the vegetarians were leaner, smoked and drank less, exercised slightly more and were more likely to have a university degree. They were less likely to have used &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/hrt-what-every-woman-needs-to-know-now-jjv8prxdq#:~:text=An%20estimated%20one%20million,the%20UK%20who%20are%20menopausal." class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; or oral contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/vegetarians-power-hungry-study-meat-eaters-720pwzt0d" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vegetarians are more power-hungry than meat eaters — why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study took these factors into account but it was impossible to say to what degree the differences in cancer outcomes were caused by what different groups were eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Britain is facing &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/uk-living-cancer-case-record-m39rjhfhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;a growing cancer challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

Among under-50s cancer cases have risen by almost a quarter since the mid-1990s, driven partly by obesity, sedentary lifestyles and diets high in fat, sugar and salt and low in fibre. Premature deaths caused by cancer cost the economy an estimated £10.3 billion a year, with £3.2 billion of that from those under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study’s authors say that, while vegetarian diets are not a magic bullet, they appear to offer protection against several cancers with minimal risk of harm, making them a potentially valuable part of prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/food-drink/article/10-easy-vegetarian-recipes-that-non-veggies-will-love-too-k6llvtw7n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 easy vegetarian recipes that non-veggies will love too&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers are based at Loma Linda University, a Seventh-day Adventist institution in California.

We’re wired to optimally poop at certain times: within the first one or two hours upon waking, soon after eating meals, after a cup of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/" target="_blank"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/19/running-gut-gastrointestinal-nausea-diarrhea-bleeding/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. These classic triggers tell our colon to start contracting — propelling our poop forward and helping us feel the “urgency” to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJEMUYW6V5FBRF5Z7PWXDQMHQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When we travel, everything about our routine goes awry. We’re running around and become easily stressed, which greatly alters our poop patterns, and we’re often left with no choice but a public bathroom when we feel the call. That alone creates so much &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/02/pooping-at-work/" target="_blank"&gt;poop anxiety&lt;/a&gt; that people are just unable to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWBXCNCS3ZCGZBWEC4PBDVF4F4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Furthermore, when we travel, we tend to drink less water, eat more processed, carb-rich foods either on the go or indulging at restaurants, and we rarely get to drink coffee and exercise the same ways we do in the comfort of our home routines (sitting for hours on a plane isn’t helping your bowels one bit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O3XM7ZE6SNCRXM6PKYBZ25OLAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because of all this, traveler’s constipation is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPTVGWUDLZEGPOMGYUXCC4FKKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I strongly recommend you start taking something that will help at the start of the trip — even a day or two before leaving. It’s always easier to get ahead of a problem than to chase after it when it becomes a crisis. Start with something easy like an extra fiber supplement or MiraLax, which is a mild laxative that pulls water into your intestine. If that doesn’t do the trick and you find you’re seriously backed up, go for a stimulant laxative like senna, which you can pick up over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WEHGUO4SGZDD5EANZKMXV222FI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My brother has watery, loose stools, four or more times a day. He does admit that it would be nice not to go so often, so what OTC remedy could he try?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VK6ISEWKBGKDI3ZSCOH4GFPOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You don’t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to poop once a day to be healthy. The number of times we poop depends on a multitude of individual factors — our diets, our exercise patterns, how stressed we are and our circadian rhythm to name a few (did you know that, unlike many other organs, your colon rises and shines just like you do — it’s why having a bowel movement in the first hours after waking is easier than later in the day!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHYJWNH7T5E3HJ3UGT3PYR5VKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So I tell my patients that “normal” is what’s comfortable for you. In general, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2018/01000/characterizing_normal_bowel_frequency_and.21.aspx?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;Americans think&lt;/a&gt; that anywhere from three bowel movements per week to three bowel movements per day is “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDLQKNOT6ZFDJISPAIXPXW6XQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It sounds like, for the most part, your brother is pleased with his habits. Four stools a day is on the higher end of typical, and I can’t comment specifically on his situation without knowing his whole history. But assuming all else is stable, and he’s perfectly content, I might let someone like this be. If he finds that the frequent call of nature is interfering with his ability to socialize, or leading to discomfort, he should absolutely talk to his physician. “Change” is definitely possible (“improvement,” however, depends on your perspective here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TYEUOSEW6NBFBL44DZ2FN5PTEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps the thing I love most about your asking this is that you and your brother seem to have a healthy open dialogue about poop! In so many families, this is not the case.

Sure, some of it is age — constipation, after all, comes for us all and is more common among older Americans. But it’s often other factors for which we may not be connecting the dots: Has your exercise routine shifted? Did you start any new medications or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/31/supplements-benefits-research-science/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;? Has stress from your job, relationships or family shifted?

Fiber is a powerful, shape-shifting ally — it can bulk up loose stool and also soften hard stools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VUPB7L7WURDLZGKTJK7ICD7YS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s a pro tip: Try taking two &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/07/kiwi-help-ibs-constipation/" target="_blank"&gt;kiwis&lt;/a&gt; a day — a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074830/?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that consuming two kiwis per day was just as effective in increasing stool frequency and reducing straining as prunes. But unlike prunes, eating kiwis helped with bloating too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EF5NOW63ANGGXMBOIG767RXI5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since being on Ozempic, I’m always constipated. Without laxatives, I get severely impacted. Softeners and fiber were not effective. Any suggestions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y4ND44SUXFFLXBYLI7HD3GO7K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GLP-1 agonists, like semaglutide (brand name Ozempic), slow down our gastrointestinal motility, or in other words, how quickly our guts can propel contents forward. I know this comes as no surprise to anyone on these medications: the GI side effects are a huge reason many people can’t stick with them in the long-term. This delay can affect our GI tracts from our stomachs all the way down to our colons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5AGAE5JFBHPPOV34I2WXNBSTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a much-discussed &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;randomized-controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide for weight loss published in 2021, about 23 percent of people on semaglutide experienced constipation and 44 percent experienced nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDYLJYCWMVGA3BZ2MECKQIHF5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So what you’re experiencing is common — and as more people get access to GLP-1 agonists, we’re going to have to start being more preemptive in addressing these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNWTEPA2IJE27C3FYIHB2NFXR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Everyone’s bodies and lifestyle is different — for some, increasing fiber or using the occasional over-the-counter laxative may be sufficient to keep things moving smoothly. But I’d explore options with your physician about what else you can try if you feel you’ve exhausted your options. We have many ways we can treat constipation, including safe but strong prescription medications at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LOUUZ7QLTBCEFJIZU33C3JPOJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It could also be that you warrant other tests to see whether there may be any other issues contributing to your symptoms. For me, the main thing is not to suffer silently. If you let your doctor know how bad things are, we can work together on possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-story subtype-link-box" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:00:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQdnFTNWtsci0tcXBnSkdFd2Z4dXNJdFNsX2lTRkNFZXFqWHF3MzFQamYxMmEtMTd2M3lhWUM5WDVGRXVweUQ1Sml4d0NtbVF4Sm5oUk4zNldTMnFJbTF1RndfeF9rMlI0QUlaMnZTRkRUMkdySk5WdWNFSjYtbE1yNW04TC1RN2ZtbjI3b053</guid></item><item><title>鳄梨油与橄榄油：心脏病学家分享哪种对您的心脏有益- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSmVSUnFVWmVXQnM2VUFuUWM4ZkM0aUdVVW94LTUzZXk4Nmw4TE9tbVI4bnI4LXoxOGk3SEZDSzZCbGxXSUVud2kxUFRFcHNFUGR5Z3l1MGRHcUhzT1RfV09aYm5SV3FMd0JWbEpaX1ZvUjFYTS1KNjVvT1lETmZjRjF2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both olive oil and avocado oil are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado oil is great for high-heat cooking and blends well into dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil has the most research supporting its heart-health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been a go-to for heart-healthy cooking, but avocado oil is quickly rising in popularity for its versatility and nutritional benefits. So which one is better for your heart—or does it make a difference? We asked cardiologists to weigh in.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once known as a niche ingredient favored by avid cooks, avocado oil has steadily gained mainstream popularity. Its neutral flavor and high smoke point make it a standout for cooking, but its potential heart-health benefits really set it apart. Here’s a look at what it can offer for your cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil contains a mixture of beneficial fats, with a high proportion being monounsaturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consuming these fats is linked with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cholesterol management&lt;/a&gt;. “Oils high in monounsaturated fats help reduce LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and raise HDL (‘good’) cholesterol,” explains&lt;a href="https://chicagoheartvascular.com/about/rohit-vuppuluri-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Rohit Vuppuluri, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at Chicago Heart and Vascular Specialists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both human and animal studies suggest that avocado oil may help lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, a small 2017 study found that replacing butter with avocado oil reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels in 13 overweight individuals. However, larger human studies are still needed to confirm these effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Heart-Healthy Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil is rich in plant compounds that act as antioxidants—like tocopherols, phytosterols and carotenoids—which can support heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These compounds work by neutralizing free radicals, the unstable compounds that cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Vuppuluri explains that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so taming it via diet is a heart-healthy choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit of using avocado oil is its high smoke point, which helps minimize the formation of free radicals during cooking. “Avocado oil is known to be the most resistant to high-heat cooking,” says&lt;a href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologists/dr-khashayar-hematpour-md-1902065543" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Khashayar Hematpour, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann and UTHealth Houston. “As anyone who’s been in the kitchen knows, some oils, like butter, burn quickly and darken, which means they’ve produced harmful compounds.” Avocado oil, on the other hand, can be heated to around 480°F (280°C) before it begins to break down, making it an excellent option for high-heat cooking.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil’s inflammation-fighting properties may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. “[Avocado oil’s] anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidant compounds help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow,” says Vuppuluri. For now, most of the evidence comes from animal studies, so more human studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, a 2022 study found that women who ate more avocados—not avocado oil specifically—had a significantly lower risk of developing hypertension. In fact, those who ate five servings per week (half an avocado per serving) reduced their risk of high blood pressure by 17%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although more research is needed, these benefits might also apply to avocado oil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-olive-oil-for-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Benefits of Olive Oil for Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been celebrated for its versatility and heart-supporting nutrients. Here’s what we know about this classic cooking oil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like avocado oil, olive oil is packed with antioxidants—though the specific types vary. Olive oil contains a variety of polyphenolic compounds, including phenol alcohols and acids, secoiridoids, lignans and flavones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to Hematpour, these heart-healthy compounds neutralize free radicals, helping to keep inflammation in check. In fact, numerous studies have linked greater olive oil consumption with lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Supports Healthy Cholesterol and Blood Lipids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research on avocado oil is still in its early stages, olive oil has a much lengthier track record of improving cholesterol levels in people. This comes down to their healthy monounsaturated fats, says Hematpour. Studies have found modest increases in HDL cholesterol and reductions in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with olive oil consumption—particularly when it’s used instead of butter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Support Healthy Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding to its list of heart-healthy benefits, olive oil may also support healthy blood pressure. According to a 2020 review, both experimental and human studies suggest that this flavorful fat has antihypertensive effects—thanks to its high oleic acid content and antioxidant-rich polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “On top of that, if you consume a diet that has a higher proportion of unsaturated fats, that means you’re consuming less saturated fat, which is the harmful kind that can increase blood pressure,” says Hematpour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-final-verdict"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While both avocado and olive oil are great choices for heart health, the cardiologists we spoke with recommend olive oil for its longer track record in research. “Olive oil has been extensively studied and has strong evidence that it is heart-healthy,” Vuppuluri says. He adds that these benefits are especially clear in the context of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, where olive oil is a staple and likely plays a role in its cardiovascular benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, remember that quality counts. The olives used and their method of processing can alter the nutrition of olive oil, Vuppuluri says. “Cold-pressed, unrefined olive oil is best to preserve the full nutritional and heart-healthy benefit.” It’s especially great when used on salads or with moderate-heat cooking like sautéing or baking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your choice may also depend on how you plan to use the oil and your taste preferences. Olive oil’s bold, robust flavor livens up dishes like roasted veggies and meat marinades. Avocado oil has a lighter taste, meaning it blends well into dips, dressings and baked goods—and it’s better for high-heat cooking methods like frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although olive oil has more research behind it, both olive and avocado oils can be heart-smart additions to your daily meals. Thanks to their similar nutritional properties and rich antioxidant content, they may help improve cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Meanwhile, their unique flavors lend themselves well to different culinary preparations. If you have the pantry space, why not try both?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine supplementation is booming among those seeking greater muscle size and performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is certainly not a new discovery, &lt;a href="https://creatineforhealth.com/creatine-history/"&gt;with research dating back to the 1830s&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/creatine-supplements-market-report#:%7E:text=The%20global%20creatine%20supplements%20market,energy%20during%20high%2Dintensity%20exercise."&gt;popularity and sales&lt;/a&gt; have continued to grow, and have expanded beyond bodybuilders and athletes to clinical applications and benefits beyond muscle performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, creatine stands as one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.2000.80.3.1107"&gt;most researched supplements&lt;/a&gt;, and new findings continue to support its use for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;consistent and measurable results in bodybuilding, fitness and overall health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-231-1_11"&gt;creatine is naturally found in foods&lt;/a&gt; like red meat and seafood, and also produced naturally in the body, supplementation has surged in popularity, especially among young men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Creatine can help maintain energy levels, especially during short-duration, high-intensity exercise like weight training.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Unsplash/Gyan Shahane)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth in popularity is largely due to young men’s desire to increase muscle size and muscle strength. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.13.2.198"&gt;Several meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; have looked at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-013-0070-4"&gt;effects of creatine&lt;/a&gt; supplementation during &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/OAJSM.S123529"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; on properties of muscle, and support its &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000000220"&gt;use and effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, creatine can help maintain energy levels, especially during short-duration, high-intensity exercise like weight training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creatine’s role in the body&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a physiological perspective, once in the body, the majority of creatine is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/00003088-200342060-00005"&gt;stored in the muscle as phosphocreatine (PCr)&lt;/a&gt;. In this form, it can help maintain energy levels through the maintenance of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the body’s primary energy currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because creatine supplementation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/cs0830367"&gt;increases intramuscular levels of creatine&lt;/a&gt;, it may enable resistance training at a higher intensity and for longer durations, leading to greater gains in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine’s impact on muscle performance may be more well known, it does not paint the whole picture. Research is revealing creatine’s positive impact outside the muscular system, showing positive effects on the storage and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00238.2004"&gt;metabolism of glucose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/meta.2001.28159"&gt;blood-flow dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2003.11.036"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt; and positive benefits for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.04.013"&gt;cognition and brain function&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dosage and safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a research perspective, dosage recommendations for men can vary, but typically either five grams of creatine daily, or a customized dosage based on bodyweight of (0.1 grams per kilogram per day) have been shown to be well-tolerated and effective for increasing muscle performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-231-1_11"&gt;food intake perspective&lt;/a&gt;, to consume about five grams of creatine in the diet, an individual would have to consume about 1.15 kilograms of beef, or about a kilogram of pork, for example. This means even a diet that is high in creatine-containing foods may not be enough to maximize its benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high calorie content of eating enough of these foods to reach the target creatine intake makes supplementation a practical and appealing option, both for ease of consumption and calorie considerations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, from a cost perspective, at about $0.50 per serving, it’s an easy and cost-effective strategy to reach creatine intake goals. With new forms of creatine seemingly being released all the time (capsules, gummies and flavoured powders), it makes it easy to maintain intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Resistance training is a paramount component to the positive effects of creatine.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Unsplash/Victor Freitas)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the safety of creatine supplementation, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;position stand paper&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.sportsnutritionsociety.org/"&gt;International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; concluded that creatine supplementation poses no greater adverse effects in healthy individuals compared to placebo, even with higher dosages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, creatine hasn’t been immune to its share of negative claims. Anecdotally, creatine may have some whispers of undesirable side-effects; however, research looking at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w"&gt;common myths and misconceptions of creatine&lt;/a&gt; (including concerns about water retention, hair loss and dehydration) have largely removed many of the fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resistance training is key&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that while creatine consumption on its own may still show &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-011-0972-5"&gt;some positive effects&lt;/a&gt;, it is largely creatine consumption in combination with resistance training that leads to benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance training &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041285"&gt;can increase measures of muscle growth and performance&lt;/a&gt; (muscle power, muscle strength and muscle endurance) and it’s the combination of creatine with resistance training that will maximize its effects. So resistance training is a paramount component to the positive effects of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, creatine is not an essential nutrient. Individuals can see improvements in muscle growth and muscle performance while focusing on the intake of high-quality and nutrient-rich foods, a well-designed individualized resistance training program, combined with adequate high-quality sleep and proper stress management without the need to supplement creatine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy lifestyle is the foundation of well-being, including the groundwork for effectively building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine supplementation has made its way into the hands of those seeking the secret to greater muscle size and performance. It is well researched and widely accepted, and it continues to increase in popularity due to the positive effects when paired with a solid resistance training program, its safe risk profile when consumed at evidence-based dosages and its low-cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creatine supplementation is not essential, it may be a practical, affordable and effective choice for those seeking muscle growth benefits and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

My husband’s mother, father, and the majority of his extended family are compulsive gamblers. They are constantly in debt, and many have been bankrupt multiple times. Thankfully, my husband does not gamble or have addictive behavior. His problem isn’t addiction, it’s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband cosigned several high-interest loans for him, but when his dad stopped paying them back , my husband refused to cosign another loan. But besides his dad, he is very loyal to his family and helps them out when they ask for money.&lt;/p&gt;

I have recommended gambling addiction services, but he dismisses it as a cultural/family problem and doesn’t think it will help. Do you have any recommendations for how to help someone in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

Their ubiquity makes KRAS mutations a great target for cancer therapies, but the mutations have long been considered impossible to target with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70ab09" class="body-graf"&gt;To accomplish this, the vaccine uses short chains of amino acids called peptides that teach immune cells to recognize and attack&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cells with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;KRAS mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-718116" class="body-graf"&gt;“The critical step is engaging an immune response,” Wainberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1b23" class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer vaccines are a growing field of research, but many of these vaccines are personalized to the patient. This means their tumor must be sequenced for a specialized vaccine to be created. The vaccine in the current study, however, doesn’t need to be personalized and would be available off the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-dd31e0" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing lingering cancer cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ad911" class="body-graf"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03876-4" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 1 trial&lt;/a&gt;, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f0764" class="body-graf"&gt;Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f3c72" class="body-graf"&gt;After surgery, blood tests showed that a smattering of cancer cells remained behind, referred to as microscopic residual disease, which is very common with pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00c80b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about cancer that is so microscopic that we can’t see it on scans,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8707f" class="body-graf"&gt;These cells can travel elsewhere in the body and grow into &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/liquid-biopsies-alert-advanced-breast-cancer-patients-new-drugs-are-ne-rcna209735" target="_blank"&gt;metastasized tumors&lt;/a&gt;, prompting an often fatal cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy can kill some of these cells, but some usually remain in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d83449" class="body-graf"&gt;“Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5088b5" class="body-graf"&gt;Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. Thirteen also received booster shots. The whole process took 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b185b" class="body-graf"&gt;About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7dd43a" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. A few people were “super-responders” who mounted an abnormally strong immune response to the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75e4cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those people had the best outcomes,” Wainberg said. His team is currently running a randomized &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2024.42.3_suppl.TPS720" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 2 trial &lt;/a&gt;to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cef6fa" class="body-graf"&gt;In the Phase 1 trial, people with pancreatic cancer survived for an average of 29 months and lived recurrence-free for more than 15 months post-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79e4c6" class="body-graf"&gt;“That far exceeds the rates with resectable cancers,” said Wainberg, referring to cancers that can be removed with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6ef5c2" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-889a17" class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. Only recently has medical technology made the strides researchers needed to hone the treatment. Refined mRNA technology and gene sequencing becoming faster and cheaper has put cancer vaccines back into clinical trials, Dougan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adb508" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-reduces-relapse-therapy-trial-shows-rcna79543" target="_blank"&gt;Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are showing promise in both &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine-mrna-treatment-trial-rcna192702" target="_blank"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccines-frontier-cancer-treatment-rcna8886" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, but a one-size-fits-all cancer vaccine would make treatment faster and cheaper. Past trials using peptide vaccines have failed to prevent cancer recurrences. But the peptides in the new vaccine, called lipophilic peptides, have something past treatments did not — a tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67dc61" class="body-graf"&gt;“That tail sticks in the lymph nodes where immune cells get activated,” Dougan said. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f58f3" class="body-graf"&gt;More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences. Memorial Sloan Kettering is also working on an &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01266083" target="_blank"&gt;off-the-shelf vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that targets a gene mutation found in 95% of people with acute myeloid leukemia. The data from the KRAS-targeting vaccine trial published Monday showed it is likely possible to target these mutations with nonpersonalized vaccines, something researchers long thought was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91f421" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The fact that the long-term survival really correlated with T-cell response suggests that the vaccine caused this,” Dougan said, referring to the specific immune cells activated by the vaccine. “The idea that you can target KRAS is really exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNLS1peXpqalFiUDN6OUczcjNLckpTWVlrZkJJa0tlRXdBV1NMSHZvVjB1RlJMNlBVVzlQUDVhS05QNjFCcjd1Nzk0Nk9QbGNsNWJDZGUwQ3V4QUdFM3I2NWh6YmlRS0ZYYjJDdTctMHdIXzh4MnJTT1ZvcEh4ZVpEQzV5SDBaMm1Id3lTTkQ5LWFaRWhDUTQyOVpTZERBVU1YaUNBcG1QVzIyWTNiaEN6UnA5dE9famVr0gFWQVVfeXFMT2F0TXZmbTV1VDRMT3JkbU1haVByZk93NWNTYzh5d2UwWDNpSllBZG9JQ2ExbWptbUE0MDBuS3l3T2xtT0g3T0xqLWpqcy1jdHhuQkkwMlE</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，现成的疫苗有望预防癌症复发-《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNR1FaUEFDa3g2Um5DVUdJSGFGY3otaWpaZUw2UXFDVFFiVWcyOTlGWU1LcHpHb2VsUmdCYkRsY3NjNk9BcV9MaEY2VEJCN1FYbHlYaGxmMlcxMDdBaGFHTk9MbkhsMkh5SDViSkFFNkFCTXlDT1p3N05VQk5tTEZKdndoN2lWd3JqUVJiamlCYWkzRU4tZjdOZ2V0OW4wcUVVLWlEWnpzMndaYzRjZ1Z0bQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An off-the-shelf vaccine has shown promise in preventing the return of pancreatic and colorectal cancer, researchers have revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cancer vaccines have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/31/what-are-cancer-vaccines-and-have-scientists-finally-found-a-cure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.

These mutations result in the production of altered Kras proteins that cause cells to divide and proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Wainberg and colleagues reported how they gave a vaccine called ELI-002 2P to 20 patients who had had surgery for pancreatic cancer and five who had been operated on for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine contains peptides – long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The vaccine works by training the T-cells of the body’s immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells with mutations that result in them producing the altered Kras proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At a median follow-up of almost 20 months, the team found patients fell into two groups: 17 who had a strong immune response to the jab and eight who had a weaker response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the former group experienced a longer period before their cancer returned and survived longer overall. Overall, four of those 17 patients died during follow-up, compared with seven of the eight who had a lower immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the study is early stage research designed primarily to assess safety, involved only 25 participants, had no controls, and looked at two very different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even so, experts said the results were worth noting. Siow Ming Lee, a professor of medical oncology at University College London, who was not involved with the work, suggested the ELI-002 2P vaccine could be combine with other kinds of immunotherapy, and might help a wider range of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With promising early results and potentially fewer side-effects than current oral inhibitors, this off-the-shelf cancer vaccine could expand treatment options for Kras-driven cancers and warrants further testing in larger trials, including exploring its potential use in lung cancers driven by mutations in Kras gene,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Shivan Sivakumar of the University of Birmingham, who works on mRNA-based pancreatic cancer vaccines, said it was fascinating so many of the patients in the study showed a clear immune response to the off-the-shelf vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Sivakumar noted that a key advantage of personalised mRNA vaccines was that they did not have to rely on mutations in the Kras gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said it was now important to carry out randomised control trials of the ELI-002 2P vaccine and follow patients over a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How many times have we been down this garden path where we’ve got really excited about the science? But actually, ultimately, the real scientific experiment is in patients,” Sivakumar added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNR1FaUEFDa3g2Um5DVUdJSGFGY3otaWpaZUw2UXFDVFFiVWcyOTlGWU1LcHpHb2VsUmdCYkRsY3NjNk9BcV9MaEY2VEJCN1FYbHlYaGxmMlcxMDdBaGFHTk9MbkhsMkh5SDViSkFFNkFCTXlDT1p3N05VQk5tTEZKdndoN2lWd3JqUVJiamlCYWkzRU4tZjdOZ2V0OW4wcUVVLWlEWnpzMndaYzRjZ1Z0bQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家终于从列奥纳多·达·芬奇的绘画中解开了500年前的谜团--印度国防评论</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxONzc5WWNQWDUtZE1xTE9HNkNQazVUMGYxOVVQQzFvNWhaeklRMUQ1Njd6LTN1SUVhS0VNQ2NnclZyVDRBZ3NZdk83TlRsMUZ4Q1hKTFptT1huTUZqT0tzUUJHbzFuS1o1N3pIWWZXSEVZeWdibGptZ3pyQUIxcEs1TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers have cracked a 500-year-old anatomical puzzle that was first identified by the brilliant Leonardo da Vinci. The mystery surrounds the trabeculae of the heart, an intricate muscular network that has baffled scientists for centuries. Da Vinci sketched these fine, branching structures in the 15th century after meticulously dissecting the human heart. However, it wasn’t until recent advancements in computational biology and genetics that the function and importance of the trabeculae were truly understood. This discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2635-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combined fractal analysis, MRI technology, and genetic research to unveil crucial insights into heart health that could have a profound impact on cardiovascular research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Da Vinci’s Pioneering Work on Human Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/leonardo-da-vincis-sketch-hidden-tunnels/" data-type="post" data-id="73044"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;, the polymath renowned for his art and scientific inquiries, made significant contributions to the study of human anatomy. His work, particularly his dissections of the human body, was revolutionary for his time. In the late 15th century, while most of Europe still adhered to ancient ideas about human anatomy, da Vinci’s detailed sketches of the human heart, muscles, and organs went far beyond what was known at the time. His heart drawings, in particular, included the first depictions of trabeculae, complex, tree-like structures within the heart’s chambers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though da Vinci had observed these structures, he was not entirely sure of their function. He theorized that they played a role in ensuring the circulation of blood, a precursor to what we know today about cardiovascular function. However, the exact role of the trabeculae remained a mystery for centuries. His work laid the foundation for future generations of scientists to unravel the secrets of heart anatomy, though it wasn’t until the 21st century that technology caught up with his insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Discovery of Trabeculae’s Role in Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article titled &lt;em&gt;“The role of myocardial trabeculae in cardiac function and disease”&lt;/em&gt;, researchers utilized a novel combination of genetics, MRI imaging, and fractal analysis to finally unlock the true function of trabeculae. This study, which analyzed heart images from more than 18,000 participants in the UK Biobank, revealed that the trabeculae are not simply remnants of embryonic development, as once believed. Instead, they play a vital role in regulating the heart’s performance by affecting the efficiency of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One of the most groundbreaking aspects of this study was the identification of a link between trabecular structure and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Researchers found that certain structural characteristics of trabeculae correlate with a higher likelihood of heart conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias. This finding opened a new door in the study of genetic predisposition to heart disease. Researchers could now pinpoint specific genetic loci that contribute to the formation and regulation of trabeculae, giving them a better understanding of how heart diseases develop at a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fractal Theory and Its Role in Understanding the Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fractal theory, which deals with complex, self-similar patterns found in nature, played a crucial role in this discovery. Just as a tree branches out into smaller and smaller limbs, trabeculae have a similar branching structure within the heart. By applying fractal analysis, scientists could study these branching patterns in detail, allowing them to make more accurate predictions about how the heart functions. This mathematical model not only helped in understanding the trabeculae’s role but also provided insights into how these structures might influence heart performance and disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application of fractal theory was particularly important because it allowed researchers to analyze the complex geometrical patterns of trabeculae in a way that wasn’t possible with traditional methods. By examining the branching structure in such detail, the team was able to identify subtle differences between healthy and diseased hearts. This breakthrough opened up new avenues for using computational models to simulate heart disease and predict how different factors, such as genetics or lifestyle, may affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Cardiology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant revelations from this study was the intersection of genetics and the trabeculae’s role in heart disease. By using data from the UK Biobank, scientists were able to correlate specific genes with the development and function of trabeculae. This breakthrough is especially important because it ties the structural changes in the heart to underlying genetic factors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Through this genetic analysis, researchers identified several loci linked to the regulation of trabeculae. These loci are responsible for the formation of the trabecular network, and variations in these genes may contribute to abnormalities in heart function. This discovery could lead to the development of new genetic tests for early detection of heart disease, enabling doctors to identify individuals at risk before symptoms even appear. Furthermore, understanding the genetic basis of trabeculae could lead to targeted therapies aimed at modifying these structures to prevent or treat heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s an expert guide to the best pre-workout food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbs are your friend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to energy, carbohydrates are where your focus should be. There's been a big debate about carbs (bread, pasta, bananas, rice, and so on), and they've been frequently deamonized, but they're vital, says Lululemon ambassador &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Hazel Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, who you may know as &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodmedic/?hl=en-gb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@thefoodmedic&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram. “There’s some evidence that having protein pre-workout might help with muscle repair, but in terms of fuelling the workout, carbs are king,” she explains. “If you’re a reasonably active gym bunny, carbs and protein in the pre-workout meal are your go-to nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing is everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduling of pre-workout meals is another heated discussion. Wallace says all meals are, in a way, your pre-workout nutrition, with protein a part of your diet throughout the day. Two or three hours before your workout, eat a meal with all the key food groups, “You can probably fit a full, balanced meal in–carbohydrates plus some protein, such as chicken or fish,” advises Wallace. “But think about limiting the amount of fat and fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Careful with fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Wallace, fat and fiber slow down your digestive process: “If you’ve ever gone for a HIIT workout or a run and started to feel nauseous, that’s because your blood is being directed away from your gut.” Although fat and fiber are incredibly important during other times of the day, they need to be limited before exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final run-up to the workout, as you’re turning up the Taylor Swift or Tame Impala on your headphones, keep it simple. “Stick with some fruit or rice cakes,” says Wallace. “A big salad packed with chickpeas and pulses before a run would probably really sit in your stomach and also not give you the energy you need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of fat and fiber you can deal with will vary according to whether you’re planning a furious HIIT extravaganza or a more sedate strength session, as the more aerobically intense the workout, the less you want to be weighed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;You don't need pre-workout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of us training don’t need a pre-workout shot. The most effective pre-workout stimulant is caffeine, according to the evidence, and you can get that from coffee,” says Wallace. “If you’re looking for a little boost, have a strong coffee 30 minutes before you exercise—that will be all that you need.” She warns that commercial energy drinks can contain very high doses of caffeine—there’s a danger that failing to include them in your daily calculations could result in jitteriness and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same applies to protein shake—a well-balanced diet should mean you have enough protein. “If you have really high protein requirements because you’re training for a marathon or &lt;a data-offer-url="https://hyrox.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://hyrox.com/"}' href="https://hyrox.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hyrox&lt;/a&gt;, for example, they can be the cherry on the cake, but they shouldn’t replace whole protein in your diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running on empty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I personally am not a fan of fasted training,” says Wallace. “There is no evidence that you perform any better and it does not seem to show improvement in fat loss. In fact, we have seen some people drop off in performance so they don’t use as much energy in the workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:35:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1OQWlUdk55azVjdkZGbXFYZmdMb2pHYXhTbUZwUGNlSU5KVHEyb25YekROYVo5ekp3YTRlWlRUZVdEQ2NzRktxQVNLWElWT1lIckpycnpsd2JyNDRLcU0zVU9ZMlJMRWRoTnMtWnRGYw</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州发现头上长着“触手”或“角”的兔子-东爱达荷新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNTDN5TzR6NFZ4Z0N0cGwzVk5jcm5DeUtETGFJODYxakt4UUlDTTlMSWVXdUtHMkpsZ1U4eVZ6ZGtxSkYzR19ra1ZnM2Jtc2lnb0pUOXFTa3J1RUNncXgwTTEwTXM3UXFWR2pLNXdjaUVjVUVJRWlzSmFESlRXOG1OYnBlWnAxU1YyNnI0aGFLQU9GT21zeHlhS1BzWUlNb1dpeHlSNEZZVE8yZFkxQjFpclAwa2xqZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORT COLLINS, Colo.

Researchers compared individuals with and without compulsive sexual behavior, measuring trauma history, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with compulsive sexual behavior scored higher in all three areas, and statistical analysis showed that trauma predicted narcissistic sexual attitudes, which in turn predicted hypersexuality. The findings suggest that addressing sexual narcissism could be a key component in treating compulsive sexual behavior, particularly in individuals with histories of abuse or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediating Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual narcissism significantly mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and hypersexual behavior, explaining over 60% of the variance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk Group:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with compulsive sexual behavior scored higher in trauma history, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality than controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Trends:&lt;/strong&gt; Men, religious participants, bisexual individuals, and non-academics reported higher hypersexuality scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies a clear psychological pathway from childhood trauma to compulsive sexual behavior, offering a new focus for prevention and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How This Aligns with Previous Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports earlier findings linking abuse history to hypersexuality and builds on work showing narcissistic traits can influence sexual aggression and risk-taking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Could inform the development of targeted therapy modules addressing sexual narcissism within trauma-informed treatment programs for compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has uncovered a striking psychological pathway linking early-life adversity to compulsive sexual behavior: childhood trauma appears to foster sexual narcissism, which in turn fuels hypersexuality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining both individuals seeking treatment for compulsive sexual behavior and a control group without these difficulties, the researchers found that this combination of past harm and personality traits could explain more than 60% of the variance in compulsive sexual behavior scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypersexuality, sometimes referred to as Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD), describes persistent and excessive sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that are difficult to control and continue despite negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual narcissism—a more focused form of narcissism—centers on sexual relationships, characterized by an inflated sense of one’s sexual desirability, entitlement in sexual contexts, low empathy, and an exploitative approach toward partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they form a potent mix that can perpetuate risky or harmful sexual patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Study Design and Participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 118 adults aged 18–59, split evenly between a group meeting CSBD criteria and a matched control group. Those in the CSBD group were recruited from support programs such as Sexaholics Anonymous, while controls came from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to capture histories of abuse and neglect, the Sexual Narcissism Scale to assess attitudes and behaviors in sexual contexts, and the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory to measure compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Findings: Trauma, Narcissism, and Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the board, individuals with CSBD scored higher than controls on childhood trauma, sexual narcissism, and hypersexuality. Statistical modeling revealed that sexual narcissism acted as a mediator between trauma and hypersexuality—suggesting that early abuse or neglect increases the likelihood of developing exploitative, entitlement-based sexual attitudes, which then contribute to compulsive sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mediation effect was strong: the two factors together explained over 60% of hypersexuality variance. The findings suggest that targeting sexual narcissism in therapy could be particularly effective for individuals with a history of childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Demographic and Social Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several patterns emerged:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Men scored higher on hypersexual behavior than women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among those with CSBD, religious participants scored higher on both sexual narcissism and hypersexuality than their non-religious counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bisexual participants reported higher hypersexuality than heterosexual or homosexual participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-academic participants scored higher than those with higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While notable, these trends require replication in larger, more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why These Results Matter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for treatment approaches that address both the legacy of childhood trauma and the maladaptive sexual attitudes that may stem from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, hypersexual behavior may operate as a maladaptive coping mechanism, and sexual narcissism may reflect learned patterns of control, self-protection, or validation-seeking. Empathy training, entitlement restructuring, and trauma-informed care could improve recovery outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge the study’s limits, including its cross-sectional design, self-reported measures, and culturally homogenous sample. Future research should explore these relationships over time, assess whether reducing sexual narcissism reduces hypersexuality, and examine these dynamics in more culturally varied populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By illuminating how trauma, personality, and sexual behavior intersect, this work provides both clinicians and researchers with a clearer map of CSBD’s underlying drivers—and new opportunities for more targeted, effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this behavioral neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-025-03137-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Study on Childhood Trauma and Sexual Narcissism in Individuals with Compulsive Sexual Behavior Receiving Counseling&lt;/a&gt;” by Rotem Yaakov et al. &lt;em&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Study on Childhood Trauma and Sexual Narcissism in Individuals with Compulsive Sexual Behavior Receiving Counseling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) has been associated with trauma and neglect in childhood. There is evidence that CSB is related to child physical and sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual narcissism was linked with aggression, sex at a young age, and many partners for sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined the associations between childhood abuse and neglect, sexual narcissism, and hypersexual behavior among participants of a sex addiction support group and a group of control participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 118 adults, including 72 men and 46 women, with a mean age of 32 years (SD = 9.32) and an age range of 18–59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included 59 participants in the sex addiction group (sexaholics anonymous, SA), 36 men and 23 women with a mean age 31.41 years (SD = 8.13), and the control group from the general population included 36 men and 23 women with a mean age 32.47 years (SD = 10.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory, the Sexual Narcissism Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Childhood trauma was associated with sexual narcissism and with hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mediation model showed that sexual narcissism and child trauma significantly contributed to ratings of hypersexual behavior, and explained 60.3% of the variance of hypersexual behavior ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, using the Bootstrapping method, the indirect effects found in this model showed that sexual narcissism increased the likelihood of hypersexual behavior, and it was a significant mediating factor between trauma and hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, this study indicates that sexual narcissism mediated the relationships between childhood trauma and hypersexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings explain the role of sexual narcissism and CSA in hypersexual behavior and it may have clinical implications for the treatment of CSB disorder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQaWJrYXdQM2dmdTY5cHhodHk1SUd2VE9jT3I3MExVZUFZbFI5eC1pUlhsYXZUOGVBODdYOFBDcEJmR2tCWVpDNzlvOHNXdlR2WmxYc2xzZW0xZlktYldpTXBjMUFvaUFpNnVFTkY1WkRNUXJHVmVBT2ZoNVBUSnd5aA</guid></item><item><title>女性希望更早知道的23个健康课程- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS1JFTGZ4MmZZbHVOdDc3TzBxR2tFR2ZIeUJ2dXJmOW5jNnliNHY3b3hSVjBvYW1ha0k3cU9PRm1QMGhJU1ZFUENFRXAtczlKV3lFNGhGc0pmSWVhZFRRbkgtSUxVUVRBTUlfVXY0YjVCanZDc09sVWlXcE5sM19XWVRLVWgwUUVxUExrMzZuY1Y1Yl8xTld4MXR4WXhUY2Jy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

He rinsed the cut with hydrogen peroxide and pressed on a Band-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, the 77-year-old was in the emergency room, vomiting with a fever. His symptoms escalated — his blood pressure dropped and lab results showed high levels of lactic acid, a warning sign of impending septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors later found the culprit was &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/gulf_coast/vibrio-vulnificus-gulf-coast-states/article_c92ad177-41f2-415a-84f3-49274965a451.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;: a rare and potentially deadly bacteria found in brackish, warm coastal waters. The infection often occurs when open wounds come in contact with contaminated water or shellfish. So far this year, 32 people across the Gulf Coast have contracted it, and eight have died, according to the states' health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy's case was different — he didn't enter water after cutting his leg, his daughter Kay Kennedy Regimbal said. Instead, the bacteria came from his trailer, which he had recently used to launch a boat in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving treatment from hospitals in Bay St. Louis and New Orleans, including two surgeries to remove skin tissue, Kennedy died on July 21 of organ failure caused by the infection, Regimbal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-right tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-6390810c-991f-427a-93cb-f125eeb074cc" data-instance="#gallery-items-eeeba7d0-0a41-4b92-bbf6-518ba6b4764c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-eeeba7d0-0a41-4b92-bbf6-518ba6b4764c"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Basil Kennedy died of organ failure caused by Vibrio vulnificus last month in Bay St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;/span&gt;
                            
                        
                        &lt;span class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regimbal and her sister Rebekah Kennedy said their father's case underscores a widespread misunderstanding of how Vibrio vulnificus can be contracted. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;People with open wounds should be cautious when swimming in brackish or warm coastal waters or handling raw seafood, particularly when those with weakened immune systems. Vibrio can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Vibrio vulnificus infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis — a severe bacterial infection that kills the flesh around an open wound, which is why it is called a "flesh-eating" bacteria, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There doesn't need to be a fear of the water," Regimal said. "There needs to be an education and a knowledge of if you have a cut, if you potentially could have been exposed, if there is a risk, how to handle it and what to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that the infection may make people fear the water is personal for Regimbal and Rebekah Kennedy, whose happiest memories are of tubing and fishing with their father on his sailboat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of our favorite family memories are on the water," Regimbal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basil Kennedy's lifelong love for the water never dwindled, even in retirement, when he and his wife took a transatlantic cruise from England to Miami and boated through Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he wasn't sailing, Basil Kennedy traveled the world. In 2023, he, his wife and Rebekah Kennedy took a train across Europe and made brief stops in London, Paris and Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, Basil Kennedy loved his home: Hancock County, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Kennedy noted how "he always wanted to give back to the community," including his hometown of Waveland, where he served in the city's yacht club and co-founded the Waveland Ground Zero Museum to help commemorate the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was happy. He was resilient. He had a servant's heart," Rebekah Kennedy said, describing him as "the life of the party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regimbal and Rebekah Kennedy hope their father's death helps spread awareness and education about Vibrio vulnificus, without instilling fear of water. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My dad would be devastated," Regimbal said, "to hear that people fear his most favorite thing in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice symptoms of Vibrio after being near water or seafood, such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever or skin lesions, seek immediate medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Researchers at Kyushu University have developed a revolutionary organic molecule that acts as a “switch” for both OLEDs and medical imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 The molecule, named CzTRZCN, combines &lt;strong&gt;thermally activated delayed fluorescence&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;two-photon absorption&lt;/strong&gt; to enhance efficiency in displays and imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🖥️ CzTRZCN achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% in OLED applications, highlighting its potential for brighter and more energy-efficient screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 The molecule’s metal-free, low-toxicity nature makes it highly &lt;strong&gt;biocompatible&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for safer and sharper &lt;strong&gt;medical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers at Kyushu University have unveiled an innovative organic molecule capable of transforming both OLED displays and medical imaging technologies. This dual-function molecule acts as a “switch,” shifting its structure to emit light for displays and absorb light for deep-tissue imaging. This discovery could revolutionize consumer electronics and biomedical diagnostics, merging two previously separate technological worlds. With the potential to power brighter screens and enable safer medical imaging, this advancement represents a significant leap forward in material science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revolutionizing OLED and Medical Imaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OLED displays, celebrated for their vibrant colors and energy efficiency, utilize materials that emit light through a process called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). TADF improves efficiency by converting triplet-state energy, which is typically wasted, into light-emitting singlet states. This process enhances display brightness and reduces energy consumption. In contrast, deep-tissue medical imaging demands materials that absorb low-energy, near-infrared light to minimize cellular damage and improve imaging precision. Two-photon absorption (2PA) enables this by allowing a molecule to absorb two lower-energy photons simultaneously, focusing on tissue at the laser’s focal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining TADF and 2PA in a single molecule has been a longstanding challenge due to their conflicting structural requirements. TADF benefits from twisted molecular structures with separated electron orbitals, while 2PA requires planar structures with overlapping orbitals. This makes dual-function molecules exceedingly rare. The Kyushu University team has tackled this challenge by creating a molecule, CzTRZCN, that combines an electron-rich carbazole unit with an electron-deficient triazine core. Cyano groups further adjust the orbital arrangement, allowing the molecule to act as a “switch” between its roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vcV2TWPZMT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/microsofts-1-billion-quantum-leap-theyre-playing-god-in-denmark-igniting-fears-of-tech-tyranny-and-global-power-struggles/"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 Billion Quantum Leap: “They’re Playing God” in Denmark, Igniting Fears of Tech Tyranny and Global Power Struggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakthrough in Dual-Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative molecule, CzTRZCN, demonstrates its dual functionality through theoretical calculations and practical experiments. In OLED applications, it achieved a record external quantum efficiency of 13.5% for triazine-based TADF materials. Its high 2PA cross-section and brightness make it an excellent candidate for medical imaging. The non-metallic, low-toxicity nature of CzTRZCN enhances its biocompatibility, making it suitable for use in medical probes and imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This metal-free, low-toxicity molecule is ideal for medical probes,” said lead researcher Youhei Chitose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team emphasizes the potential impact of time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, which could greatly benefit from this material’s capabilities. By successfully integrating strong TADF and high 2PA, the molecule promises to bridge the gap between photoelectronics and bioimaging, offering new possibilities for combined consumer electronics and healthcare applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Future Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study from Kyushu University outlines a strategy for designing molecules with distinct orbital arrangements for light absorption and emission. This approach could inspire the creation of multifunctional materials, extending beyond current medical and display uses. The research team aims to expand the molecule’s design to cover a broader range of emission wavelengths and is seeking collaborations with biomedical and device engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential applications include in vivo imaging, wearable sensors, and next-generation OLED displays. By combining photoelectronics and bioimaging, the research opens doors for devices that seamlessly integrate consumer electronics with healthcare technologies. The study, published in the journal Advanced Materials, highlights the potential for CzTRZCN to create brighter screens and more precise, less invasive medical imaging tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Challenges and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, scaling the production and application of CzTRZCN poses significant challenges. Developing a cost-effective method for mass production while maintaining the molecule’s unique properties will be crucial. Additionally, further research is needed to optimize the molecule for various applications, including extending its emission range and improving its stability in different environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between material scientists, biomedical engineers, and industry partners will be essential to fully realize the potential of this breakthrough. As the boundaries between consumer electronics and healthcare continue to blur, what new innovations will emerge from this intersection?&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that cannabis products higher in cannabidiol (CBD) tended to produce more consistent improvements in negative mood and sleep quality, while the benefits of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant products varied depending on participants’ inflammatory status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects nearly one in three adults in the United States and often overlaps with other issues, such as poor sleep. Many individuals with anxiety experience insomnia or disrupted rest, which can in turn worsen mental health. Treatments for these conditions are often addressed separately, even though they frequently occur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence indicates that inflammation—a process in which the immune system releases chemical messengers called cytokines—may be a shared biological factor contributing to both anxiety and sleep problems. Higher cytokine levels have been linked to worse mood and poorer sleep quality in prior studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoids like THC and CBD, found in the cannabis plant, are known to have anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory settings. Surveys also suggest that many medical cannabis users turn to the drug to help with anxiety and sleep issues. However, scientific findings on cannabis for these purposes remain mixed, and little is known about whether a person’s level of inflammation might influence the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to investigate whether four weeks of cannabis use would affect inflammatory markers in the blood, and whether baseline inflammation might change how cannabis influences mood and sleep quality. They also wanted to compare products with different cannabinoid profiles: THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, and those containing equal parts THC and CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing anxiety and improving sleep are two of the most commonly reported reasons why people report using cannabis. And while it makes sense that anxiety and sleep might be linked (who hasn’t tossed and turned at night when they have a lot on their mind?), both are also rooted in inflammation,” said study author Jonathon K. Lisano, a postdoctoral research associate in the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/center/cuchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CUChange lab&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Colorado Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels of inflammation, which is generally not great, have been linked to both higher levels of anxiety and worsened sleep quality. With cannabis, particularly CBD, being able to impact inflammation we wanted to see if there was a relationship between cannabis use, inflammation, anxiety, and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 171 adults with at least mild anxiety. Of these, 147 were assigned to use one of three types of cannabis—THC + CBD (12% each), THC-dominant (24% THC, very low CBD), or CBD-dominant (24% CBD, very low THC)—while 24 participants served as a non-use control group. Participants in the cannabis groups purchased their assigned products from a dispensary and used them as much or as little as they wished over the four-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality at the start of the study and after four weeks. Blood samples were collected at both time points to measure concentrations of six pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were combined into a single inflammation score. The researchers examined whether cannabis use changed cytokine levels and whether starting levels of inflammation influenced the effects of cannabis on mood and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use did not significantly alter cytokine levels over the four-week period, regardless of the product type. “I was surprised to see that despite there being a decent amount of pre-clinical data on the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis, we did not observe any changes in inflammation over the 4 weeks of this study,” Lisano told PsyPost. “This could be due to those pre-clinical studies using much higher doses of CBD and THC than is obtainable for the average individual using cannabis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, initial inflammation levels played a notable role in shaping outcomes for mood and sleep. Participants using CBD-dominant or THC + CBD products experienced consistent improvements in overall negative mood scores—covering depression, anxiety, and stress—across all levels of baseline inflammation. These improvements were driven mainly by reductions in depression and anxiety, while stress levels showed little change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those using THC-dominant cannabis saw mood improvements only if their baseline inflammation was in the average range, with little or no benefit for participants with low or high inflammation. The non-use control group also showed some mood improvement, but it was less consistent and did not appear tied to changes in specific mood components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep quality showed a similar pattern. Cannabis users with average or high baseline inflammation tended to report better sleep after four weeks, particularly if they used CBD-rich products. For participants with low inflammation, improvements were smaller and less consistent. Those who did not use cannabis reported no meaningful changes in sleep quality regardless of their inflammation level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that CBD’s more consistent effects could be linked to its stronger anti-inflammatory actions compared to THC. Laboratory studies indicate that CBD may reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines by influencing pathways in immune cells, potentially stabilizing mood and sleep regulation across different inflammatory states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my big takeaways from these results are twofold,” Lisano explained. “1. Inflammation does appear to impact how cannabis affects our sleep and anxiety over time (which is the first time this has been reported). 2. Products containing higher amounts of CBD appeared to produce the most consistent reductions in anxiety and improvements in sleep quality. Products containing high amounts of THC had varied results, especially when it came to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s design had strengths, including a naturalistic approach that reflected real-world cannabis use and verification of product adherence through blood tests. However, the absence of a placebo control means some of the reported benefits could reflect participants’ expectations rather than purely pharmacological effects. Federal restrictions in the United States make placebo-controlled studies with legal-market cannabis challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are also limited to smoked or vaporized cannabis flower and may not apply to edibles, tinctures, or concentrates. Additionally, the study only covered a four-week period, so it is unclear whether the effects would persist, diminish, or change with longer-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the big thing people need to keep in mind is that these results are preliminary; one study is not the end-all be-all when it comes to the impact of cannabis on sleep and anxiety,” Lisano noted. “While we report that sleep quality got better over the 4 weeks, this is based on the participant’s subjective experience. Just because we feel like we are sleeping better doesn’t mean we actually got better sleep. There still needs to be more research using more objective data (i.e., sleep studies looking at sleep cycles and brain wave activity).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that future studies should examine how dose, frequency, and method of cannabis use interact with inflammation to influence mood and sleep. Longer-term research could also determine whether these benefits hold for individuals with more severe, clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping we can start to look at a few different things,” Lisano said. “It would be great to look at more objective data regarding sleep quality to assess if people are actually getting better quantifiable sleep versus just feeling like they are sleeping better. It would also be great to see what other aspects of health, like exercise, diet, etc., influence the effects of cannabis on things like anxiety, sleep, and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2025.1549311" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Inflammatory state moderates response to cannabis on negative affect and sleep quality in individuals with anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jonathon K.

			&lt;p&gt;Air conditioning can feel heaven-sent on hot summer days. It keeps temperatures comfortable and controls humidity, making indoor environments tolerable even on the most brutally warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some people avoid using air conditioning (AC) no matter how hot it gets outside, out of fear that it will make them sick. While this may sound far-fetched to some, as a microbiologist I can say this fear isn't altogether unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an air conditioning system malfunctions or isn't properly maintained, it can become contaminated with infectious microbes. This can turn your AC unit into a potential source of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;numerous airborne infections&lt;/a&gt; – ranging from the common cold to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sick buildings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/"&gt;"Sick building syndrome"&lt;/a&gt; is the general name for symptoms that can develop after spending extended periods of time in air-conditioned environments. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, congested or runny nose, persistent cough or wheeze, skin irritation or rashes, trouble focusing on work and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-rapid-surge-in-legionnaires-disease-linked-to-cleaner-air"&gt;Mysterious, Rapid Surge in Legionnaires' Disease Linked to Cleaner Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to occur in people who work in office settings, but can happen to anyone who spends extended periods of time in air-conditioned buildings such as hospitals. The symptoms of sick building syndrome tend to get worse the longer you're in a particular building, and are alleviated after you leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257240"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from India compared 200 healthy adults who worked at least six-to-eight hours per day in an air-conditioned office with 200 healthy adults who didn't work in AC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AC group experienced more symptoms consistent with sick building syndrome over the two-year study period – particularly a higher prevalence of allergies. Importantly, clinical tests showed those who were exposed to AC had poorer lung function and were absent from work more often, compared with the non-AC group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that AC office workers have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518424/"&gt;higher prevalence of sick building syndrome&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not work in an air-conditioned environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's suspected that one cause of sick building syndrome is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/74/Supplement_1/0/7707269"&gt;malfunctioning air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. When an AC unit isn't working properly, it can release allergens, chemicals and airborne microorganisms into the air that it would normally have trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning air conditioners can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231099002745"&gt;release chemical vapours&lt;/a&gt; from AC cleaning products or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap/refrigerant-safety"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; into the building's air. Chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde and toluene are toxic and can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171686/"&gt;irritate the respiratory system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorly maintained air conditioning systems can also harbour bacterial pathogens which can cause serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; is the bacteria that causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html"&gt;Legionnaires' disease&lt;/a&gt; – a lung infection contracted from inhaling droplets of water containing these bacteria. They tend to grow in water-rich environments such as hot tubs or air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170851" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642.jpg" alt="graphic of lung disease" class="wp-image-170851 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/legionairres_disease_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; can cause infection when inhaled in water droplets.

Symptoms usually begin to show between two and 14 days after being exposed to Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; infections&lt;/a&gt; can be life-threatening and often require hospitalisation. Recovery can take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fungal and viral infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of dust and moisture inside air conditioning systems can also create the right conditions for other infectious microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, research on hospital AC systems has found that fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhizopusspecies&lt;/em&gt; commonly accumulate within the water-rich areas of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;hospital ventilation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fungal infections can be serious in vulnerable patients such as those who are immunocompromised, have had an organ transplant or are on dialysis – as well as babies who were born premature. For example, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/environmental-control/air.html"&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;causes pneumonia, abscesses of the lungs, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and skin, and can also infect burns and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/"&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aspergillosis/"&gt;mostly respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and include persistent wheeze or cough, fever, shortness of breath, tiredness and unexplained loss of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral infections can also be caught from air conditioning. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121730259X"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that children in a Chinese kindergarten class were infected with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html"&gt;norovirus pathogen&lt;/a&gt; from their AC system. This caused 20 students to experience the stomach  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is usually transmitted through close contact with an infected person or after touching a contaminated surface, in this instance it was confirmed, unusually, that the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; was spread through the air – originating from the air conditioning unit in a class restroom. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160878/#:%7E:text=Vaporized%20material%20from%20infected%20person's,3%2C%207%2C%2015%5D"&gt;Several other cases&lt;/a&gt; of norovirus being spread this way have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, air conditioners can also help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/about/index.html"&gt;stop the spread of airborne viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows AC units that are regularly maintained and sanitised can reduce circulating levels of common  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170842" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;including COVID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170852" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/maintain_ac_642.jpg" alt="technician maintaining ac" class="wp-image-170852 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/maintain_ac_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/maintain_ac_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/maintain_ac_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170852" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Keeping your AC well maintained can be a boon for your health.

This makes inside air drier than outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending extended periods of time in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725"&gt;low-humidity environments&lt;/a&gt; can dry out the mucus membranes in your nose and throat. This can affect how well they prevent bacteria and fungi from getting in your body – and can leave you more vulnerable to developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5AB6706237E7ED5AF05FC19B9D4A88FC/S2633289223000017a.pdf/mouth-breathing-dry-air-and-low-water-permeation-promote-inflammation-and-activate-neural-pathways-by-osmotic-stresses-acting-on-airway-lining-mucus.pdf"&gt;deep-tissue infection&lt;/a&gt; of the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are designed to filter air contaminants, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the air we breathe indoors. But this protective shield can be compromised if a system's filter is old or dirty, or if the system isn't cleaned. Ensuring good AC maintenance is essential in preventing &lt;a href="https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/ventilation-risk-health-care-associated-infections"&gt;air-conditioner-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260648/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 30-day plan is set at 1,500 calories, with modifications for 2,000 calories. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each day provides at least 75 g of protein and 28 g of fiber for satiety. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes anti-inflammatory nutrients, such as fiber, healthy fats and antioxidants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Growing research links chronic inflammation to several health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even some autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although it's too simple to point to chronic inflammation as the only reason these diseases develop (other factors include genetics and the environment), it certainly motivates us to incorporate more anti-inflammatory nutrients into our diets. Foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;with inflammation-reducing benefits&lt;/a&gt; include antioxidant- and fiber-rich produce, such as berries and dark leafy greens, and foods with unsaturated fat, like salmon, nuts and seeds. This plan includes a month of meals and snacks incorporating the principles of the anti-inflammatory diet—let's get started.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 287 to 400 calories while the lunches span 342 to 460 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet pattern is typically considered an anti-inflammatory diet. It focuses on loading up your plate with a variety of vegetables, fruits, fatty fish, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_627-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet is one that is full of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, plant-based proteins, fish, spices and herbs. These foods contain vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that help fight chronic inflammation in the body that can lead to disease. Foods that may contribute to inflammation are added sugars, processed meats and refined grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_628-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_629-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has consistently shown that eating foods that can help reduce or not contribute to the inflammatory process in the body can help reduce the risk of developing and accelerating chronic diseases such as cognitive decline, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🩺 A new wearable patch offers real-time blood pressure monitoring, revolutionizing how &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt; is managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 The device uses &lt;strong&gt;liquid metal&lt;/strong&gt; sensors and laser sintering to achieve precise measurements and high durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏃‍♂️ Suitable for patients and athletes, the patch provides continuous tracking, outperforming traditional &lt;strong&gt;cuff-based&lt;/strong&gt; monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📡 Researchers are integrating &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; and wireless technology to enhance accessibility and functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development in the field of medical technology, researchers have unveiled an innovative wearable patch designed to monitor blood pressure in real time. This device, a skin-mounted electronic patch, promises to revolutionize how hypertension is tracked and managed in daily life. As high blood pressure continues to affect more than 1.3 billion people globally, with only a small fraction effectively managing the condition, this new technology could be a game changer. The device’s ability to provide continuous monitoring and deliver hospital-grade accuracy could transform healthcare practices and enhance patient outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How the Patch Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new patch, similar in appearance to a bandage, offers a fresh approach to measuring blood pressure. Unlike traditional cuff-based monitors that are bulky and require inflation, this patch records the slight delay between the heart’s electrical signals and the mechanical pulse as blood flows through the arteries. The delay shortens when blood pressure rises and lengthens when it falls, providing an accurate measure of blood pressure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture these subtle movements on the skin, the patch utilizes a highly sensitive, flexible sensor made from liquid metal. This material remains fluid at room temperature, conducts electricity effectively, and possesses elasticity akin to human skin. Despite the challenges posed by its high surface tension, researchers successfully employed laser sintering to shape the liquid metal into precise circuits necessary for the patch’s function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cNaBYepRWA"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/this-is-the-coffee-maker-pc-you-wont-believe-exists-doug-macdowells-coffeematic-pc-uses-hot-brew-to-cool-its-cpu-in-stunning-tech-mashup/"&gt;“This Is The Coffee Maker PC You Won’t Believe Exists” Doug MacDowell’s Coffeematic PC Uses Hot Brew To Cool Its CPU In Stunning Tech Mashup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unmatched Durability and Precision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features of this patch is its durability. It can stretch up to seven times its original length and withstand over 10,000 cycles of stretching without performance degradation. In rigorous tests, the patch demonstrated superior accuracy in tracking rapid blood pressure changes, especially during and after exercise, outperforming conventional cuffs. This level of precision challenges the notion that blood pressure should only be measured during clinical visits and opens up new possibilities for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch holds promise not only for general use but also for specific applications such as intensive care monitoring and workplace safety. It provides a convenient solution for patients with hypertension, allowing them to track their condition easily throughout the day. Additionally, athletes and fitness enthusiasts may find value in monitoring how their blood pressure responds to various training routines.&lt;/p&gt;

The accessibility and ease of use offered by the patch make it a practical option for a wide range of users, from patients managing chronic conditions to those interested in fitness and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Professor Seung Hwan Ko of Seoul National University, represents a significant advancement in wearable health technology. As the study gains attention in the scientific community, the potential for widespread implementation and acceptance grows. This innovation not only holds promise for individual health management but also offers a glimpse into the future of healthcare, where technology empowers people to take control of their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of this wearable patch marks a significant step forward in the battle against hypertension and related health issues. While the technology is still in its early stages, its potential to transform healthcare is undeniable. As researchers continue to refine and expand its capabilities, questions arise about how this and similar technologies will shape the future of medical monitoring. What other health innovations might emerge to further enhance our ability to manage and prevent diseases independently?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis showed that centenarians not only had lower rates of disease in late-midlife, they maintained this advantage throughout their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, at the age of 85, only four per cent of those who went on to live to 100 had experienced a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who died between the ages of 90 and 99, the figure was around 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, by the age of 100, just 12.5 per cent of centenarians had experienced a heart attack, compared to more than 24 per cent of those who died in their 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say this suggests they are not merely surviving serious illness better than others—they are avoiding it for much longer, and sometimes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this study, published in August last year, focused on more serious diagnoses of major diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate whether the key to longevity might also lie in avoiding less serious conditions, the team conducted a second study, which was published this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This analysis included 40 different medical problems, ranging from mild to severe, such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
