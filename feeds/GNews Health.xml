He remembers one particular evening walk that he took with his father, Phil, as they weathered out those early months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As they strode through the neighborhood, Nadel, now 26, said that the prospect of a vaccine was exciting, but the idea of pharmaceutical executives profiting off a devastating virus left him feeling uneasy. Phil grew concerned by the complex ethical predicament that his son laid out, and Nadel could quickly tell that his father was acting strangely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think I have to tell you something,” Phil said mid-walk, before explaining that in the early days of the HIV/Aids epidemic he had invested in what are known as, “viatical settlements”. Phil would buy the life insurance policies of people dying of Aids, often with just weeks or months to live, for a portion of the plan’s value in cash. For many, it afforded them the ability to pay for food, rent and hospital bills as debilitating illness left them unable to work. For others, it was their chance to blow the funds on travel or experiences with the limited time they had left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026","elementId":"1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/documentaries-coming-out-this-year"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was thrown for a total loop,” Nadel told the Guardian. “He had been part of this industry, and that the profits he made from it had helped to bankroll my childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Nadel, a gay film-maker, it sent him into a “spiral” that did not begin with the desire to make a movie. “I understand myself as somebody who stands on the shoulders of Aids activists who use their bodies to create a world in which I can be healthy and take my PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] every morning, and also in which I can be relatively free as a gay man,” he said. “So many of the advances in gay rights came from the visibility of the Aids era, and here I was learning that my existence and privilege was hinged in some way on those same people dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fad95cd5-eb3a-4f8b-b200-85ed6c922f76" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As he began investigating the muddied history of viatical settlements throughout the peak of the Aids crisis, the outlines of a film started to emerge. The result is Nadel’s Oscar-shortlisted documentary short, Cashing Out, which tells the story of how a cottage industry of buying up life insurance policies was both ghoulish and liberating in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the film’s main characters, Scott Page, inadvertently configured an early viatical settlement when his partner, Greg, who was living with Aids, became progressively sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Short on cash, but armed with a robust life insurance policy, Page ran an advertisement in a local paper to see if someone could buy Greg’s plan in exchange for an advance. When a private investor reached out, the couple struck up a “loose agreement” that allowed Greg to live out the time he had left with some financial security. The payout meant they could also move into a house and get a golden retriever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As dozens of old pictures flash across the screen, you see an idyllic slideshow of two people with a rich life: fixing up their home, lying by the beach and laughing with friends. But it’s also a bittersweet record of Greg’s final months. Page ultimately remembers how the money in-hand was “absolutely transformative” for his late boyfriend, as he “saw the stress leave his body”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The absurdity of getting a cash advance on your death, however, wasn’t lost on Page. When he saw the peace and freedom it gave Greg before he died, he turned his energy into becoming a viatical broker for scores of other gay men – often without loved ones by their bedside – who were dying of an illness that much of the federal government had shrouded in shame and prejudice. When Page started to approach banks and credit unions about getting involved in the investment scheme, they were incredulous and insisted that payouts should be for the families of the deceased. For Page, their arguments weren’t rooted in reality. “These people’s families have walked away from them,” he recalls in the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It meant that private individuals made up most of the initial investor network when it came to buying up policies. They were provided a morbid ledger. On one side, the value of a policy and the dollar amount needed to buy it outright, on the other, the T-cell count of a person living with HIV/Aids and their life expectancy. Often, it served as an assurance that a payout was inevitable. The sicker the policyholder, the quicker the windfall for the investor. Soon, institutions realized that these small-time individual investors were making a lot of money, and changed their tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel constructs his documentary like a deeply reported magazine story: gripping anecdotes, a rich – albeit macabre – historical backdrop, and varied voices who show that while some people benefited from viatical settlements, there were so many who were left out of the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;DeeDee Chamblee, a trailblazing advocate and activist reminds us that for Black trans women living with Aids – who often didn’t have jobs that provided life insurance policies – a viatical settlement was something they could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e291937c-773f-4d00-9857-5c84610327ca" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A still from Cashing Out.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: New Yorker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the most harrowing moments of the documentary comes when Chamblee remembers suffering through her illness, with only three T-cells left, and how she would fantasize about getting a payout to live out her final days in peace. “I could go to the beach, and I could stay there until this thing is through,” she reminisces. “That was not a reality at all,” she adds, expecting to end up buried in a wooden box in a “potter’s field” with other unclaimed bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chamblee’s testimony is a jolting reminder that her experience living with Aids is a world away from the white, gay men who had policies to sell. In making Cashing Out, Nadel realized the most marginalized, particularly trans sex workers of color, aren’t “afforded a shred of basic dignity when their death is imminent”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But by the late 1990s, significant developments in antiretroviral therapy meant that HIV-positive people started living longer, defying the odds and outliving the predictions that viatical investors were initially promised. “It was going great, until people didn’t die all the time,” Page says, with a glint of karmic joy in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, those betting on death stopped cashing in so easily. Instead, they found themselves stuck paying premiums on policies that would never pay out. “I think they banked on that not being an urgent enough question for our world to answer,” Nadel said. “Then they were angered when the activists from Act Up successfully pushed the government to develop and release drugs quickly … anybody who invested their whole retirement in viaticals was making a really bad investment decision, and that is no one’s fault but their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel filmed interviews with his subjects – Page, Chamblee and Sean Strub, a long‑term survivor who founded POZ magazine – over the course of a year. Their unfiltered honesty ultimately prompted him to fold in the story of his own father’s investment in viatical settlements. “I just felt like they were submitting themselves so fully to the process,” he said. “And so for me to have a secret about my relationship with this, that I was keeping from the audience, just felt wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent interview, Nadel said that while his thesis for the film had shifted over time, it now seemed straightforward. “This helped a lot of people, but I’m disgusted that it had to exist,” he said. Modern‑day precarity in accessing healthcare in the US – from the expiration of Covid‑era Obamacare subsidies to the substantial cuts to Medicaid funding projected over the next decade – means Cashing Out can serve as both a historically specific and evergreen indictment of the country’s tenuous social safety net, Nadel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the government refuses to fulfil its role in taking care of us, we have to come together and find creative ways to take care of each other,” he said. “Illness does not discriminate … so I want to encourage people who watch the film to find their strange bedfellows in the fight for survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQWlk2V1MwMXZaUGxrdmZoMGNJanJ3eXNydkx0TV9xMVotekFwRl9Pbk5URjVPeW91b2lGcmdGanFVTUo2dF9sVXdhdnZQRHRUR1BKTEVUSkVHVHhhNHhhNWhUcmlfeTBUa0M2Qm82QVEtUGRBUnpoNWlmclBjNzBPdVh6VG10TVdOUVRTMXRUMDBod3Jwcndz</guid></item><item><title>“不要忽视你身体的信号” ：如何真正照顾你的脖子-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/21/how-to-look-after-your-neck-posture-stretch</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re reading this on your device, chin tucked into your chest, or leaning over your desk shaped like a question mark, pause for a moment. How’s your neck feeling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The way we sit, scroll and work means we often hold static positions for too long, creating tension and stiffness that radiates through the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say we can change how we move to counteract the strain and protect your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="take-micro-breaks-to-reset" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Take ‘micro breaks’ to reset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work at a desk, aim to break up sitting every 30 to 45 minutes, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at Western Sydney University. Simply standing up for 60 to 90 seconds is enough to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Regular ‘active breaks’ can reduce neck and back discomfort and reduce office stress,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While you are standing, he suggests taking a few deep breaths while rolling your shoulders back. Gently turn your head from side to side. Stretch your chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="243e6be4-7043-4fae-bd1d-23e5d9f9971c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Can adult tummy time undo the dreaded ‘tech neck’ from hunching over a screen? | Antiviral","elementId":"243e6be4-7043-4fae-bd1d-23e5d9f9971c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/25/can-adult-tummy-time-undo-the-dreaded-tech-neck-that-comes-from-hunching-over-a-screen"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Regular posture corrections every half hour can help, says Julia Treleaven, an associate professor at the University of Queensland School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She suggests a 10-second hold to correct your posture every half hour, where you elongate the back of the neck and “set” your shoulder blades apart. Try adding a quick 30-60 second walk during these breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="vary-your-tasks" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Vary your tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do not ignore your body’s signals, if you feel tension or discomfort, take it as a cue to move,” says Dr Poonam Mehta, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at the University of Technology in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you can’t move away from what you’re doing, try varying your tasks every hour, says Dr Peter Stubbs, physiotherapist and lecturer at University of Technology Sydney. So, if you have been typing for an hour, switch to a task that doesn’t require a screen – like a phone call or make a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bring-the-device-to-you" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Bring the device to you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Tame tech neck” by bringing your screen closer to eye level, Cavaleri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He says small habits, like using a laptop riser or propping your phone on a stand, can significantly reduce the load on your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven agrees, suggesting you check that elbows and knees are at 90 degrees, screen at eye height, with keyboard and mouse close. If you use dual screens, ensure they are at the correct height and position with the main screen directly in front to avoid being in a twisted position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You can also occasionally move your monitor slightly to the left or right, which forces your neck to rotate gently and prevents getting “stuck” in a fixed gaze, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6d17c518-7bb1-42b9-9eb8-0023f83d7b05" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Tame tech neck’ by bringing your screen closer to eye level, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, a senior lecturer in physiotherapy.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="gentle-stretches" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Gentle stretches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Don’t crack your neck, do strong stretches or repetitive self manipulating,” Treleaven says. While this may feel good temporarily, it is risky and doesn’t help, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the experts recommend gentle mobility exercises a few times a day, even while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven suggests a move called the “bow and arrow”. To do it, sit with arms extended in front of you, palms touching. Slide one hand back along your other arm, pulling your elbow back as if drawing a bowstring. Let your head follow the moving elbow, rotating gently to look behind you. Slowly reverse the motion to the start and repeat on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs recommends exercises with a small range of motion and no jerky movements such as slow, controlled neck nods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other effective micro-stretches he suggests are side rotations (keep your shoulders still and slowly turn your head to look over your left shoulder, then slowly to your right) and the ear-to-shoulder, in which you drop your ear down towards your shoulder without lifting your shoulder up to meet your ear. Aim for up to 30 repetitions, if comfortable, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="move-it" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Move it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cavaleri says regular exercise improves neck and overall musculoskeletal health. He suggests choosing walking meetings, taking the stairs, a brisk walk at lunch, or cycling to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Accumulating 30-60 minutes of moderate activity most days is a good goal, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs adds that even if you have mild pain, keep up gentle movements so your neck does not freeze up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="check-your-stress-and-sleep" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Check your stress and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People carry stress in their neck,” Treleaven says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘We stick them in shoes and forget about them’: how to really look after your feet","elementId":"4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/18/we-stick-them-in-shoes-and-forget-about-them-how-to-really-look-after-your-feet"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs says a significant part of neck pain comes from unconscious muscle tensing, particularly in the trapezius – a pair of large triangular muscles extending over the back of the neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He suggests taking a moment of mindfulness during your breaks. Ask yourself: “Am I tensing my shoulders?” then consciously drop them and relax your jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cavaleri says managing stress and sleep is key. Routines like a short wind-down stretch before bed, breathing exercises or a walk helps lower muscle tension and improve sleep quality, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep posture also matters, says Mehta, who recommends keeping your neck supported and in a neutral, comfortable position to help prevent unnecessary strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTE1EZDNaNmxBM25hN3NXd3Yzb2N4QXRfbXp4X01GLW9BeU0yc2FwUS1fbjNXTkNOeUc5WDlES2tuMFJJQ2pabkk3Z011N1lnQjd0MTV0U2k3dzJ0SVFlWnJEQU4yZ1hxZXhJVzczVkRXa0RGck9jMnp1dzlUWVA3RUQ4QlVfVFRQZVc5U3EzR3hSVGhNSmwwc0FkUGs</guid></item><item><title>我以为我已经克服了强迫症。然后我怀孕了。-切口</title><link>https://www.thecut.com/article/ocd-pregnancy-ssri-anxiety.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

But one of the nurses is at least compassionate or seems so. I’m relieved I haven’t met her before, given it’s my third visit here this week. She must be new. She doesn’t suggest I’m wasting everyone’s time as she readjusts the fetal heart monitor. I study her sparkly Crocs and the crucifix around her neck and ask if she has children. “Three,” she tells me. A few of the nurses don’t bother hiding their eye rolls anymore, so I make a point of seeking out the friendly ones who call me “sweetie” or “honey” because they feel sorry for this woman who they are certain has lost her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I alternate between the two main hospitals in my small southern city to give the medical staff at each one a break from me. Since I entered the second half of my pregnancy, I have been to each unit more than a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;

Some nights that I’ve felt propelled to the hospital, my husband has refused to come with me. On the edge of tears himself, he has said he feels he’s enabling an illness. My response has been both resentful (&lt;em&gt;How could he do this to me?&lt;/em&gt;) and relieved (&lt;em&gt;Of course he’s right&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

He’s almost as exhausted as I am, having driven us down a deserted predawn highway. I watch the printed graph of my child’s heartbeat unspool into rolls of zigzags on the hospital floor. Hospital staff come and go. The ones I haven’t met before stare at me confused. “The baby looks good.” “The baby is probably fine.” “Statistics are in your favor.” “No amount of monitoring will ensure a healthy baby,” they all tell me. Their platitudes multiply like cells. Intellectually, I know they are right. But &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ambition-work-ocd.html"&gt;OCD&lt;/a&gt;, my lifelong roommate, insists I keep checking.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m told that everything looks good. “Well, that’s a relief,” my husband says. He’s not being sarcastic; it just sounds that way. He’s thinking that the only silver lining here is that the nearby Whataburger is open 24/7. He knows I will sit in the drive-through analyzing my after-visit summary as we await our milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;

I know with certainty that &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/pregnancy-put-my-ocd-into-overdrive.html"&gt;intrusive thoughts&lt;/a&gt; will return. &lt;em&gt;What if I fall asleep and fail to notice that the baby has stopped moving? Is four kicks an hour normal, or is it five? If I feel only four in two hours, is she slowly losing oxygen? Is that a somersault? Is the umbilical cord strangling her? Isn’t that move unnaturally forceful — desperate? See, she is in distress. I knew it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00483b7ayvsnw4vh@published" data-word-count="231"&gt;After my husband collapses back into bed and my dogs sniff me curiously, I go to the refrigerator and select the most sugary drink I can find — orange juice or chocolate milk — to induce fetal movement. I open the cupboard and scoop some peanut butter into my mouth. I slink into the spare room so that I can have some privacy: I prefer to do my rituals unobserved, in the pitch-dark. I lie on my back and clench my jaw, tears coming into my eyes as I try to will my daughter to start kicking. &lt;em&gt;There, that is one. &lt;/em&gt;I wait in suspense for the second. It seems like it’s taking longer between kicks than usual. But what does “usual” mean when a baby is constantly growing? I grab my phone and start researching fetal movement. I see the same websites and message boards I’ve read before, but I reread the posts that nauseate me the most, daring myself to face potential catastrophes. Now, I’m also afraid I’m leaking amniotic fluid, even though I already had the nurses test for that just a few hours ago. I go to the bathroom and use an amniotic fluid test strip I ordered off Amazon. &lt;em&gt;The baby isn’t moving enough. Is she just sleeping? Isn’t she supposed to be awake at night? Or is she just supposed to be awake when I am sleeping?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntza00493b7amj9cpo5z@published" data-word-count="233"&gt;I don’t sleep. Once I’ve tested for fluid, I pull out the handheld Doppler that I had asked my husband to hide from me, but I know all of his hiding places. I’m weeping softly now, trying to find the heartbeat, but all I hear is static and bumping noises. I wonder if the nurses have changed shifts and I can return to the hospital with minimal shame. I finally find the heartbeat, but the reading I catch seems too high. I Google &lt;em&gt;tachycardia&lt;/em&gt; again. The URLs I have visited before have gone from blue to purple, screaming out how many times I have clicked on them. Since the Doppler is making me more anxious, I take out an old fetal monitor that I convinced my doctor to give me. It no longer has paper to record the zigzags, but I can listen to my baby’s heartbeat for hours, and I often do. It’s big and clunky and reminds me of the typewriters I grew up around in the ’80s. I smear ultrasound gel that I ordered off Amazon on my belly and press the outdated and barely operative fetal monitor to my abdomen. I can’t stop crying. I’m so tired that I feel cold. I need to rest. I wish I could stop. But my daughter needs me more. I chase her like a fish in a vast, unknowable ocean — her flickering, teasing presence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzc004b3b7aorqz295h@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;I have suffered from OCD since I was 5 years old and learning to write letters. I remember noticing that the &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; looked like the crucifix I had seen when my family occasionally went to church. It occurred to me that if I didn’t make the &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; on my worksheet look symmetrical, I would be punished — for disrespecting God, I suppose. Soon I found myself tracing &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; shapes in the foggy glass of the double doors leading to the principal’s office, too. Did anyone notice that I was rooted to the spot, unable to move because I had to trace every near-invisible shape I saw, reaching on my tiptoes, trying to keep my index finger steady? If I didn’t do this, something terrible might happen — my family might die, or I might never fall asleep again, or a plane somewhere halfway across the world would crash and it would all be my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzd004c3b7a8srdr02y@published" data-word-count="183"&gt;Around that time, the kids in my class became fascinated by the story of Bloody Mary. Even now, as an adult who knows better, something catches in my throat as I write this. The legend went that if you turned several times in front of a mirror in the middle of the night, a full glass of water in hand, Bloody Mary would come out of the mirror and scratch you all over, leaving bruises and marks on your body. In the beginning, every time I saw a mirror, I looked away. Then, at some point, I could no longer drink water out of regular glasses nor sleep over at friends’ houses if they had mirrors in their bedrooms. Looking back, I think what scared me almost as much as the spectral figure of Mary was the idea that the spell was cast through numbers. I believed that if you turned twice instead of three times, she could be confined to the shadowy prison of the mirror — but that she was still waiting to escape. Anyone with OCD understands the particular allure of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzf004d3b7ahdpddfh6@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;I was officially diagnosed with OCD at age 9 in a therapist’s office in a small college town in Massachusetts. Back then, in the early ’90s, exposure therapy was a popular treatment for OCD. My particular focus was a fear of germs and public restrooms, so my doctor gave me a key to the semiprivate bathroom in her office suite. Once I’d conquered using that bathroom without freaking out or washing my hands repeatedly, I graduated to using a big public one in another area of the building. Exposure therapy works much like inoculation. If you are exposed to the thing you most fear and the worst doesn’t come to pass, you slowly realize, through repeated practice, that your fear was exaggerated, even fantastical. If you can stand the discomfort, even the anguish, of choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to perform a ritual, your intrusive thoughts begin to change accordingly, decreasing in frequency and intensity. It doesn’t work for everyone, but exposure therapy enabled me, in my adolescent years, to manage OCD with minimal disruptions. The urgency and power of my childhood fixations began to dim with time. I thought I was better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzf004e3b7aarj7bguw@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;But about ten years later, in September 2001, I started college, two planes hit the Twin Towers, and my OCD returned with ferocity. Suddenly, I was afraid of bombs, planes, and anthrax. My roommates stared at me in horror as I scrubbed my mouth with hand soap, convinced I’d ingested anthrax from a sealed envelope in my campus mailbox. My hypochondria worsened, as did the feeling that I personally had to prevent terrorist attacks from occurring. I saw someone stuff what was probably a sandwich bag into a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble trash can, and then I couldn’t focus, imagining that the person had planted a bomb and that I would be the one who did nothing. I informed the staff, and the entire bookstore was evacuated. Don’t they always say “If you see something, say something”? But it felt like I was always “seeing” things and that I couldn’t trust my own vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzh004f3b7a085ejtf2@published" data-word-count="134"&gt;Around the same time, I convinced myself I was actually losing my vision, visiting the student health center for what I worried was a detached retina. The eye doctors I followed up with politely informed me that they tend to see these injuries in football players and in the elderly. It would be highly unusual for an 18-year-old woman who didn’t participate in any contact sports to develop this problem. Then, in my freshman Psych 101 class, I became an utter cliché, convincing myself after reading my textbook that I had the beginnings of schizophrenia. I remember putting coins in the dorm laundry machine, my textbook in front of me, and hearing the blood pound in my ears as I discovered that schizophrenia was often comorbid with OCD and tended to manifest in young people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzi004g3b7alj2etzce@published" data-word-count="123"&gt;After visiting a counselor, I was funneled into an OCD study at Massachusetts General Hospital, where therapy was free and where I filled out countless questionnaires. But I was suffering, and I quickly got tired of being a guinea pig. So I left the study, and a psychiatrist family friend convinced me to try Prozac. Somehow, all of this time, I had never been medicated. As I stood in my childhood bedroom wondering if I would have to drop out of college because I couldn’t function, a close friend told me I would feel better soon. She said that SSRIs worked slowly and then all at once; she compared them to flowers that bloom overnight but that you can’t observe growing or opening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzj004h3b7auogahnz3@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;The Prozac worked. I felt hugely better. I threw myself into college, made friends, and dated. I wrote an honors thesis, got a research grant to study in Paris, and then went on to earn a master’s degree and a doctorate. I learned to be a teacher. I fell in love and had my heart broken, and fell in love again and had my heart broken again, and then fell in love once more. I published a book of poetry. I got married.&lt;/p&gt;

We bought a house. I got pregnant and had a miscarriage at 11 weeks, after seeing a heartbeat weeks earlier. I lapsed into grief and then committed myself with renewed dedication to getting pregnant again. I succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

But even for women who don’t suffer from OCD, pregnancy can feel scary and suspenseful. Several of my close friends who don’t have mental-health diagnoses have had moments of real terror and vulnerability while pregnant, spiraling over worries about miscarriage, stillbirth, or genetic conditions. In my case, these understandable fears, with the catalyst of OCD, alchemized into a toxic mixture. The illness that had waxed and waned, but that I’d mostly kept under control with Prozac, returned with a force that I had never experienced. Even in my most desperate moments at age 9 and again at 18, I never felt unsure, as I did while pregnant, about whether I could survive what my brain was putting me through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004l3b7ahyhv01zr@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Part of the reason my OCD exploded during my pregnancy is that my doctor told me to stop taking Prozac in my first trimester. I did what he said because I was so scared of a second miscarriage, even though there’s no compelling evidence to suggest that SSRIs factor in to pregnancy loss. I can still recall looking out the window from his office at the pedestrians below and envying people who were not pregnant for their ability to move through the world unencumbered. I felt claustrophobic in my own body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004m3b7ajeiftmgf@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;It was my husband’s birthday, and I was around 20 weeks pregnant when I first felt my baby move: a tapping and rolling motion, like something turning over. The panic came a few days later, when I was walking with my mother and husband in an art museum staring at ancient artifacts. “I felt the baby a few days ago, but I haven’t felt her since. Did she die?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I asked them, tears in my eyes. Doctors had already warned me that expecting daily, consistent movement at this stage would be unreasonable. But my mind couldn’t help circling to the last days of my previous pregnancy, when I’d walked in the sunshine from the parking lot to the building where I taught and the phrase “my body is a graveyard” ran through my head on a loop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzl004n3b7amxfpkmmw@published" data-word-count="174"&gt;By 24 weeks pregnant, many women are told to start tracking their baby’s movements; their OB/GYN mentions it in an appointment or they read about counting kicks in a pregnancy book as a way of preventing stillbirth. The advice has been reinforced by our app-flooded, data-drunk culture, and at first I was excited to have something concrete to measure. But when my doctor informed me that I had an anterior placenta, meaning movements would be more muffled and harder to discern, obsessions began to take over. I tried an app called “Count the Kicks” for a while, because it felt like externalizing my motherly intuition. But soon the app wasn’t enough, because I wasn’t content to count once or twice a day. Instead, I was counting almost every minute I was awake. I managed to keep teaching by pacing during my classes; I didn’t expect to feel the baby while I was walking, so moving kept my spiraling thoughts temporarily at bay. If my students noticed my restless body language, they didn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzn004o3b7a1pd1snnu@published" data-word-count="185"&gt;Friends and family tried to help me. They answered frantic texts at all hours, begged me to medicate or meditate, researched OCD and pregnancy, and by turns argued and agreed with me. I had a smart therapist who understood how badly I was suffering as I showed up, wild-eyed, to our sessions. My midwife was also sensitive and thoughtful and tried to reassure me that there is no universal, one-size-fits-all system for movement tracking. “Get to know your baby,” she said. “Know what is not normal for your baby.” My OB/GYN even put me back on a low dose of Prozac, but it had no impact. Everyone wanted to help, and to a woman more capable of living in a gray area, this might have been comforting. But I found myself believing that if I only concentrated hard enough, I could understand all the mysteries of my child’s behavior. Lying in a fetal position chugging pineapple juice, I would repeat my friends’ words, but they didn’t feel as true to me as the inner voice telling me to count, to check, just one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzo004p3b7a61o1kf0x@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;One day, pacing the indoor track at the gym, I called several friends, lobbying them to find me a spalike psychiatric facility for expectant mothers and have me committed. I was fantasizing about something Californian and sunny, with support animals, a doting medical staff, and round-the-clock analysis of my fears. Hooked up to a monitor, I would enlist nurses to help me count baby kicks. My loved ones would make pilgrimages to see me swaddled in comforting surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

The nurses didn’t know what to do, so they gave me a sleeping pill, which I never would have taken without medical surveillance. I was hooked up all night, lying on my side in a hospital bed, and able to relax for the first time in months. If the baby stopped moving and died, it would be on their watch, not mine. I needed a break from vigilance and self-torture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzp004s3b7ajq6gywy7@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;The next morning, my doctor came in, visibly angry. He told me that he and my psychiatrist had spoken. I told him I didn’t feel I could leave. He scheduled another ultrasound to give me reassurance but insisted that it was time to go. And though I left, I felt determined to come back very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzp004t3b7a5wi72ale@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Weeks later, while my husband was at a Mardi Gras party I had refused to attend with him, I drove to the hospital and stayed overnight again. At 37 weeks, I was full term, and my mind was made up: I would not go home.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzp004u3b7anw9x3kq1@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;Later that night, despite his misgivings, my husband joined me at the hospital. The OB on call was sympathetic and seemed to think it might be possible to induce me early. When she called my doctor, he vetoed the idea but allowed for an additional ultrasound. The tech informed us that the baby was showing signs of low energy and reduced movement, but that there was most likely no cause for alarm. Still, they decided to keep me another night for monitoring. My husband went home to get some rest; he had work the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004v3b7amvcfkrt8@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;In the morning, a Monday, he returned with the intention of bringing me home. But as a precaution, they performed a biophysical profile, a special kind of ultrasound combined with a non-stress test for high-risk pregnancies. For the first time, my baby failed the test. My doctor came in and told us we would have our baby in the next hour, because I needed an emergency C-section. I was stunned, horrified, and giddy. &lt;em&gt;How was it possible that all of my unfounded obsessions had finally culminated in a measurable problem — a real, medical concern for the baby? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004w3b7aynburppy@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;As I was wheeled into the OR, I felt hope for the first time in months. I wondered if it was possible that a new life — both for me and for my baby — was about to start. I was awake throughout the surgery, and I felt pressure but no pain. The doctors were chatting casually with each other. And then I felt something immeasurably heavy lifted out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004x3b7asd6zz3y6@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;My doctor showed me the umbilical cord, which had two huge knots and had been wrapped several times around my daughter’s neck. The expression on his face was bizarre, almost sheepish. My husband and I read it as an admission — that maybe I had been right, after being wrong so many times. My OCD was real and destructive. But ironically, it may have saved my daughter’s life. I will never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzq004y3b7a6nlxihrl@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;My husband was with our daughter in her first moments; she had a little trouble breathing but was healthy and strong and nearly seven pounds. My mother got on a plane and was there to hold her on her first day of life. Then, after four days of pumping colostrum and wincing as I hobbled to the bathroom, blood tumbling out in clots every time I stood up, it was time to go. We drove our daughter home so slowly. I remember a flood of euphoria. Now she was outside of me. Now I could see her. Now I would know if she was okay or if she needed help. Now other people could observe her too. She was no longer stuck in the black box of my body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr004z3b7aqqwoeofz@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Back on the full dose of my SSRI, many of my obsessions vanished, and the arrival of more mundane fixations — &lt;em&gt;Am I changing her diaper often enough? Is she getting enough milk? &lt;/em&gt;— was a welcome development. I had relapses, but after going to my daughter’s bassinet for the fifth time to check on her breathing or to make sure her swaddle wasn’t too hot or too tight, something in my brain allowed me to stop. Five was enough. No need for a sixth or seventh visit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr00503b7aywfs121e@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;Of course, I was aware that the risks to our children only multiply as they grow. But my pregnancy had served as a rehearsal for those dangers — a kind of exposure therapy to larger unknowns. It had inoculated me, at least a little bit, to motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr00513b7a7n8m43w6@published" data-word-count="22"&gt;It’s no exaggeration to say I felt as if I had returned from far away to find my life waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

I told my therapist, and she immediately grew concerned. I could hear the fear in my parents’ voices, too. Everyone was afraid they would lose me again. &lt;em&gt;I’m not going to go down this rabbit hole&lt;/em&gt;, I remember saying out loud in my office. &lt;em&gt;I’m not going to lose my mind again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzr00543b7a8el3dw3g@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Convinced, maybe unfairly, that another woman would be more likely to understand the profound responsibility and disorientation caused by a body gestating within my own, I sought out a female doctor. One of the first things she told me was that she would not be changing my SSRI prescription, and that we would closely monitor me for signs of my OCD reemerging. She was incredulous that I had ever been advised to stop my treatment. Together, my therapist and I came up with tactics to try to preempt OCD thoughts from taking over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzs00553b7a8mp8p37v@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Still, when I reached 20 weeks and kick counting became plausible, I held my daughter on my lap and noticed that I couldn’t feel the baby inside — and the old panic resurfaced. I told myself that after I put her to sleep I could go to the hospital. But sure enough, as I grabbed the keys to the car and headed to the garage, I felt her brother again. With this pregnancy, I didn’t have an anterior placenta and the movements were much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkd4ntzs00563b7aybyu1ct9@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;So I went back inside, dropped the keys on my bedside table (close by, just in case), and crawled into bed next to my husband.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2oszd00183b79m4ju0us3@published"&gt;I have been dating “Cesar” for several months now. I’m not saying he is “the one” yet, although we get along great and our future together looks promising. But (there always seems to be a “but”), there is something about him that I don’t know if I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2ot1i00193b79mhkbskyb@published"&gt;We have been intimate, but due to our work schedules, we had never spent the night together until the last couple of weekends. Cesar, when he sleeps, sleeps on top of the covers (wearing pajamas) and basically looks like he is in a coffin. Flat on his back, no pillow, arms crossed over his chest, never moving from the time we say, “Goodnight” until one of us wakes up for the day. He says he is a hot sleeper, so that is why he doesn’t need covers, and that he “hypnotizes/hibernates” himself before going to sleep by focusing on lowering his breathing rate and completely relaxing his body.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn33z6500593b797vfxdhbs@published"&gt;One time, I honestly thought he was dead because I could not hear him breathe, and his skin actually felt cooler to the touch. It kind of freaks me out if I happen to get up to use the bathroom and come back to what looks like a dead man lying on the bed. Plus, with him on top of the covers and me under the covers (I need a cover over me to sleep), there is no cuddling during the night, which I have enjoyed with previous relationships. Any suggestions on how to get over this? We are in our mid-20s, so the chance of him actually being dead is quite slim.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2ot89001c3b79u2oywys2@published"&gt;Do you know how much money and energy people spend on magnesium, melatonin, sleep hygiene habits, meditation apps, and limiting blue light and caffeine after 2 p.m. to achieve what Cesar does with the power of his mind? I’m impressed! And I actually think this hypnosis trick is a great sign of his ability to manage his body and mind. If the two of you end up getting married and you miss your connecting flight on the way to your honeymoon, guess who’s not going to be red-faced and yelling at an airline employee? Cesar. He’ll take a few deep breaths, hypnotize himself into a cool, logical mindset, and figure out the next steps. Plus, he’s not snoring or anything? This is a win!&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2otaf001d3b791k4ih2ba@published"&gt;I hate that you’re not getting to cuddle in your sleep, but if you do want to snuggle up to his corpse-like body, you could just place a small comforter over only yourself and stick an arm out to drape over him. It doesn’t sound like he’ll give a lot back, but it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2otcj001e3b79zmamx8xs@published"&gt;Regarding your concerns that he’s dead, I have to say, sleeping people in general look a lot like dead people. Your checking his breathing and feeling his skin when you had absolutely no reason to believe he’d passed away (he’s not a three-day-old infant on his first night home from the hospital, and it’s not as if you found him lying on the bathroom floor) is concerning and makes me think the solution involves managing your anxiety. Only you know whether this is a larger issue in your life, but in the meantime, maybe you could adopt a mantra like, “He’s safe, and he’s having a wonderful night of sleep. I will do the same.” Or ask him to teach you to self-hypnotize so you won’t be awake to worry about him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jf001p3b79byi1md7d@published"&gt;I have a neighbor I’m concerned about. She has two kids in the 7 to 10 age range, which is a little older than my kids, and we’ve done occasional playdates over several years where we chat while the kids play, but that’s it. I’ve met her husband briefly. She doesn’t work, and he travels for work and is gone for weeks at a time. She’s always been extremely flaky, often canceling at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jg001q3b79dgy3r09z@published"&gt;Over a year ago, that turned into every plan getting cancelled, and I stopped trying, figuring it wasn’t a priority for them. Then recently, she called me out of the blue. She was talking very fast, in a high, child-like voice. She didn’t make much sense, but from what I could gather, her husband has called the police on her multiple times in the past year, the last time leading to an involuntary stay in a psychiatric ward. She was making claims about her husband and mother both being narcissists who were sabotaging her, repeating herself a lot, and seemed to be in a state of panic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jg001r3b79t3pds63r@published"&gt;Since then, she’s sent me several bursts of texts about some sort of volunteer work she’s apparently trying to turn into a job that is tangentially related to my field, sort of asking for advice, but never giving me enough information that I could actually give any, and filled with apologies for bothering me. I’ve tried several times to make plans with her—lunch or a walk—and I’ve expressed concern for her and directed her to mental health resources. She agrees to plans but always cancels, and insists she has neurodiverse needs (I think self-diagnosed) that require very specialized professional skills.&lt;/p&gt;

She’s clearly struggling, but we aren’t close. If it were just her, I would leave it at that. But I worry about her kids. I don’t know her husband well enough to approach him; I don’t even know if he is a safe person. I sense that she has no close friends and spends most of her time alone in her house while the kids are in school and her husband is gone. She’s clearly mentally unwell, but I don’t know if he is part of the reason for that. I think I’m doing everything I can from where I’m at, but if you have any outside suggestions, I would much appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jh001v3b79j1w0a5q1@published"&gt;Reading your letter makes me think about how hard it is for people to help spouses, siblings, and best friends who are in distress, living in chaos, or struggling with mental health issues. They often write to me feeling completely powerless to make changes in their loved ones’ lives, because we can’t force people to do anything they don’t want to do. If it’s hard for them, who are much more directly involved in the situation, it would be nearly impossible for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6ji001w3b79hwn1ub27@published"&gt;You don’t have the closeness, let alone the information about what your friend is going through, to be doing more. Even if you did, your power to push your friend toward professional help would be pretty minimal. That’s too bad, but on the other hand, I hope knowing this makes you feel a little less responsible for doing something to get to the bottom of her problems and solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6ji001x3b79t5xlqwbk@published"&gt;That said, I do have two practical ideas about ways you could help her out a little bit. The first is something you’re already doing: Listen to her. Whether she’s talking about her marriage, her job search, or her neurodivergence, just hear her out and affirm the way she’s feeling. You don’t need to understand all the details—or even feel sure that they’re grounded in reality—to say, “That must have been so painful” or, “You didn’t deserve that” when she reports on the way her husband and others are treating her, or “This is really exciting for you” when she’s sharing details about her hopes for her career. While fixing everything for her would be great, there’s something to be said for making sure she knows she’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkn2p6jj001y3b79ons60wqj@published"&gt;Second, go get those kids and bring them to your house for a sleepover or a weekend if everyone is comfortable with that. They’re already friends with your children. Even if it turns out that nothing is wrong beyond her husband traveling a lot, she could use a break.&lt;/p&gt;

Our latest visit started with her hissing and tutting at everything I did, moved on to constantly correcting the kids and me, and ended with her screaming, “You’re useless” at me because I used the “wrong” knife to cut onions. I stopped what I was doing, grabbed the kids, and left. My phone started blowing up on the way home as she left a series of increasingly ugly messages while she got sloppy drunk with her sister. I was so worried about her state of mind that I shut down our joint bank account for fear of some kind of revenge. It was bad.&lt;/p&gt;

We haven’t spoken outside of a few texts. The kids are in pieces. I don’t know what to tell them because I don’t know whether our marriage will survive. My in-laws texted me an apology, but my (ex?-)wife has only communicated anger and disappointment. We’ve been married 18 years, and every visit to her parents has gone badly, but never like this. I’ve begun separating our assets because I don’t see any way back from some of the messages she sent, particularly the ones in which she wished me and the kids harm. Where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

Her mother, Elise, thought Lola was just growing fast because of genes inherited from her father. But when she noticed that Lola had grown pubic hair too, she was floored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/vbmfnrsssw" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_23569084.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Collection: Coming of age: the emerging science of adolescence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visit to an endocrinologist in 2023 confirmed that Lola’s brain was already producing hormones that had kick-started puberty. Lola had also been struggling emotionally. “She would have panic attacks every day at school,” says Elise, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and asked that her surname and Lola’s real name be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although eight might seem young to start puberty, it’s not as rare as it once was. Data show that girls around the world are entering puberty younger than before. In the 1840s, the average age of first menstruation, or menarche, was about 16 or 17; today, it’s around 12. The average age for onset of breast development fell from 11 years in the 1960s to around 9 or 10 years in the United States by the 1990s. Some research hints that the trend mysteriously accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Although some data suggest that puberty is happening earlier for boys too, the shift seems to be less pronounced.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found a range of possible drivers for this change, with increasing body weight and obesity almost certainly playing a part. Some researchers suspect that exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals or stress during childhood could be pushing puberty earlier, but studies have produced conflicting results. The trend has prompted the international organization the Endocrine Society to develop clinical-practice guidelines on puberty, to be published in mid-2026. The guidelines will reconsider how to treat girls on the border between typical and ‘precocious’ puberty, which has commonly been defined as before the age of eight in girls, but that some specialists argue should be younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research over the past few years is also making the health risks of early puberty increasingly clear. Studies have linked it to greater risk of conditions including obesity, heart disease, breast cancer, depression and anxiety. Other research suggests that children who go through puberty earlier are more likely to experience discrimination because of their race or ethnicity, or otherwise be treated differently from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families, researchers and clinicians are now trying to work out how best to adapt and when to intervene. This might involve medications to pause the process, but also better support and puberty education for children to protect them from some of the psychological and social risks. “We want to intervene right in that moment before people start internalizing some of those feelings of being othered,” says Michael Curtis, a family social scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New normal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, puberty begins when the brain’s hypothalamus begins producing pulses of gondatropin-releasing hormone. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;What triggers this process isn’t fully understood&lt;/a&gt; — it’s probably a complex interaction between genes and environmental factors. But the result is a hormonal cascade that leads to the release of the sex hormones oestrogen (in girls) and testosterone (in boys), which drive physical changes, including menarche. (The binary terms ‘girls’ and ‘boys’ are used in this article to reflect language used in studies and by interviewees.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop in average age of menarche from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century is often attributed to improvements in health, such as reductions in infectious disease and malnutrition (see ‘Younger puberty’). This probably sped up growth and sexual maturation. Most researchers assumed that the timing of puberty had remained relatively stable since then. “Studies from the 1960s showed that it was kind of levelling off at 12 and a half years,” says Paul Kaplowitz, a retired paediatric endocrinologist who was at Children’s National Hospital in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_51957178.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_51957178.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Younger puberty.

They observed that breast development is the first outward sign of puberty in girls and that it begins around 11 years old, on average. (For boys, the onset of puberty&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was closer to 12.) The ‘Tanner stages’, which demarcate five stages of progress towards sexual maturity, became widely used in medicine and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, however, Marcia Herman-Giddens was questioning Tanner’s timings. As part of her work as a physician’s associate at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, Herman-Giddens had examined thousands of girls in the United States and observed that some were developing breasts and pubic hair “way younger than the Tanner standards”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman-Giddens and her team set out to develop benchmarks for US children. With the help of physicians from across the country, they collected data on pubertal timing from around 17,000 girls who had undergone physical examinations in physician offices between 1992 and 1993. This showed that the mean age at which breast development started was just under ten years old for white girls and nine years for Black girls. It was the first large study to suggest that puberty was beginning much earlier than Tanner had suggested, at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00933-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_50815566.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Do smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, when the team’s findings were published&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the reaction among the scientific community was, largely, disbelief. Anders Juul, a paediatric endocrinologist at the University of Copenhagen, didn’t see similar figures in Denmark and, with obesity on the rise, he suspected that US physicians had mistaken fat tissue for growing breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, however, a second US study reached a similar conclusion&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Herman-Giddens. And in 2009, Juul and his team reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that the mean age of breast development in Copenhagen had fallen from just under 11 years in the early 1990s to just under 10 in the mid-2000s. The change couldn’t be attributed to increased weight, because the girls’ body mass index (BMI) had not changed. “To our surprise, there were no differences in obesity between the old cohort and the more contemporary cohort,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 meta-analysis of 30 studies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — and the most recent comprehensive review of global trends — revealed that the median age of breast development fell by almost three months each decade between 1977 and 2013. The United States had the earliest onset (a median of 8.8–10.3 years), Africa had the latest (10.1–13.2 years) and Europe and Asia fell in between. An update&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to this study, presented at a 2025 European endocrinology meeting, shows that the trend has continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers don’t know whether puberty will continue occurring even earlier or at what point it might hit a biological floor. Globally, physicians now typically consider puberty onset between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls as in the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puberty puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have been trying to work out why puberty is starting earlier. Of their handful of plausible hypotheses, the worsening obesity epidemic tops the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02983-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02983-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;obesity rates have risen&lt;/a&gt; from around 2% of children and adolescents in 1990 to around 8% in 2022, and from around 11% to more than 20% in the United States, according to the World Health Organization. A 2022 study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of nearly 130,000 US children found a clear association between obesity and earlier puberty in children. “It is beyond any doubt that obesity is a major driver,” says geneticist John Perry, who studies growth and reproduction at the University of Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way in which body weight influences puberty is through leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. This can interact with the brain circuits that control development and reproduction. “We don’t think that leptin initiates puberty,” Kaplowitz says. “But it’s important for puberty to progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02169-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00089-8/d41586-026-00089-8_15474102.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Who exactly counts as an adolescent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers, including Juul, suspect that hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment could be at least partly responsible for advancing puberty. They point in particular to chemicals found in plastics, such as phthalates, forever chemicals called PFAS and synthetic fragrances, all of which gained widespread use in the twentieth century. These compounds can interfere with hormones by mimicking them or disrupting their activity. But results are inconsistent, and proving a link to any single substance has been incredibly difficult. “There haven’t been really any good studies that have shown this in a way that everybody says, ‘yep, that’s the answer’,” Kaplowitz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third possible piece of the puzzle is psychological stress. Some research suggests that girls who encounter stressors such as domestic violence, abuse, poverty and discrimination are more likely to start puberty at a younger age than those who do not. One 2022 longitudinal study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; found that physical or emotional abuse in early life was linked to earlier menarche in US girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress doesn’t necessarily explain the population-wide shift in the timing of puberty — there’s no rise in childhood stressors that clearly matches the downward trend in the onset of puberty. But it might interact with excess body weight, says Lauren Houghton, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York City. Her unpublished research suggests that girls who experience high levels of stress, have elevated stress hormones and a high BMI start developing breasts, on average, seven months earlier than do girls who experience low levels of stress and have a low BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress might also be a reason why more girls entered puberty early during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the years preceding it. Soon after the pandemic began in 2020, paediatric endocrinologists in Italy noticed that the number of referrals for precocious puberty soared. They later reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that 41% of those referred in 2020 met the criteria for the condition, compared with 26% in 2019. Studies from other countries have revealed a similar phenomenon and some suggest that puberty progressed faster too&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We saw “truncated and shorter puberty”, says Louise Greenspan, a paediatric endocrinologist at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

According to Amati, this life stage is when we finish building bones and muscle, and start spending hours studying, working, and socialising – all of which increase nutrient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Adolescence and early adulthood are another big window of opportunity for nutrition," says Amati. "In the 20s, growth slows, but it's still a crucial decade for establishing habits that protect heart and brain health in later life. We see that a lot of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/lifestyle-pattern-during-adolescence-is-associated-with-cardiovascular-risk-markers-in-young-adults-results-from-the-donald-cohort-study/C26C70796BF74B030C5937314CF51725" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;groundwork for cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; is already being laid in this age group, even though symptoms appear much later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188(05)00121-X/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;our teens, the body needs more of several nutrients&lt;/a&gt; compared to later adulthood. This includes calcium, vitamin D and iron – which is especially important for those who menstruate. Protein and B vitamins are also important, Amati says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So what does this diet look like? According to Amati, teens and young adults should follow a largely plant-based diet and avoid ultra-processed foods. So lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, beans, nuts, lentils and seeds. It's also important to have an adequate amount of protein for every meal, which can also be plant-based, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Studies show that following such a diet doesn't just benefit the body, it can impact mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNekdXSDcwWUY5NzFxbnQ5NVhGWEtPelFobDIxWW1aWkN6R3JCcFFRcW10eTlGS2dPb0UzbWlHWlNmaHhMMWxVM3YzcWlPSUh4NVBaLW1iSWRBM0FKbGxtc0tGYnBNeGk5S29yNXFxM21PN2IxWjFrMkVSQWNEcUlpWTdpemlsNW1XUEhpcEc0LXhyZ1dIV2UxUExXeGRqUUJ3</guid></item><item><title>我的前列腺癌筛查弊大于利吗？ - statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/21/what-psa-screening-gets-wrong-prostate-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, at age 55, I underwent my first digital rectal exam. The routine check set me on a 15-year path that transformed me from a medical editor on a daily newspaper in Chicago into an international advocate for men navigating the labyrinth of low-risk prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My exam was uneventful. My doctor, after the requisite “finger wave,” remarked, “Your prostate is small.” I also didn’t question that day the accompanying blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein enzyme that liquefies sperm to help ejaculation. My doctor failed to warn me how this simple test placed me at ground zero of a medical firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors began testing PSA levels in the 1980s to monitor diagnosed cancers. By the early 1990s, researchers promoted it for widespread screening to detect prostate cancer in asymptomatic men. Within two years of being implemented, prostate cancer diagnoses doubled, creating a testing-induced “epidemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;American men with lower-risk cancers lined up for prostatectomies, paying a steep price: 15% to 20% developed urinary incontinence, 50% to 60% faced significant erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some general practitioners and urologists elsewhere in the world were slow to adopt PSA testing because of concern about overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In 2012, the same concerns led the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to recommend against using the PSA test as a screening tool in the general population. That debate still continues, even as new prostate cancers are &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/prostate-cancer-surge-in-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;projected to double&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. During the same period, deaths from prostate cancer are predicted to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/prostate-cancer-surge-in-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increase globally by 85%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem? Over half of men treated for prostate cancer have low-risk “autopsy” cancers — silent tumors that would never cause problems and only would have been discovered in an autopsy. About 80% of 80-year-olds harbor such cancers, but die from heart disease, strokes, accidents — almost anything but prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;PSA, it turns out, is a powerful but blunt instrument. It’s sensitive but not specific. Around 20% of men with prostate cancer have normal PSA levels, while only 25% to 30% of those biopsied for elevated PSA actually have cancer. In other words, roughly 70% to 75% of “PSA-positive” screens are false alarms. The test is excellent for tracking known disease, but generally terrible as a standalone cancer detector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My own PSA was 3.9 in 2002, high enough to lead to a biopsy, which found a single core of low-risk, Gleason 6/Grade Group 1 cancer — just under the standard 4.0 threshold. By my second biopsy, my PSA had dropped to 3.6. Yet my first urologist, a private practitioner who had a financial incentive to operate,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tried to rush me into his operating room&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the following week. My second urologist, at the University of Chicago, was paid the same salary whether he operated or not. He told me I didn’t need surgery and could likely live the rest of my life without being treated. He predicted my cancer would not grow in a decade. My PSA has stabilized between 4.8 and 5.2, well below the 6.5 average at my current age, 78.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Actually, within a year of diagnosis, my cancer “disappeared” and has not been seen in four subsequent annual biopsies nor in two prebiopsy MRIs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The doctors disagree on what happened. Some think I had a spontaneous remission. Most think my cancer is just hiding. Whatever the case, I came this close to undergoing surgery I didn’t need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about prostate cancer, the most common solid cancer diagnosed in American men and the second most deadly: Like most cancers, there are few absolutes. Doctors still debate the value of PSAs — some don’t recommend the tests even as many urologists and advocates say a lack of PSA screening has led in recent years to an outbreak of incurable metastatic prostate cancer, the kind President Biden has. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The international urology community still debates the basics of treating prostate cancer: whether low-risk cancer, the kind I was diagnosed with, should even be called a cancer; which type of biopsy is safest; and whether transrectal biopsies, the most common kind in the U.S., are killing men by giving them sepsis. And of course, clinicians and researchers debate how to use the PSA test, which some doctors say is the “best test they have” — even though it is unreliable, and overdiagnoses cancers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International practice diverges sharply from American dogma. U.S. guidelines generally remain stuck at 4.0 nanograms per milliliter as the threshold for starting cancer surveillance for everyone, though many academic centers now use 3.0 ng/mL for younger men. The U.K.’s independent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) takes an age-graded approach: 3.0 for 50-59, 4.0 for 60-69, and 5.0 for men 70+. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;my 3.9 PSA would have been unremarkable in London or Stockholm. In Chicago, it triggered biopsies and anxious conversations.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This international divide reflects deeper philosophical differences. Socialistic European systems treat PSA levels as one data point in a clinical picture; capitalistic American medicine often treats it as the decision point. The result: The U.S. treats about 40% of low-risk prostate cancers, while the U.K. treats under 10%. Same disease, different medical cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial incentives cannot be ignored. A Mayo Clinic study in 2019 found that six years after diagnosis, the &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000000345" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mean costs per patient&lt;/a&gt; were $12,143 for active surveillance, $17,781 for radical prostatectomy, and $29,238 for external beam radiotherapy. When I founded support groups for men choosing surveillance almost 10 years ago, I heard fears from men with low-risk disease who felt their urologists were financially incentivized to push them into surgery. PSA gave urology a major cancer and helped upgrade its image from the specialty of syphilis and kidney stones. Now, urologists are saving lives and earning about $500,000 a year, putting them in the top 10 most lucrative specialists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that greed drives some urologists. Still, I sense that the new generation believes that surveillance is a safe choice for many low-risk patients based on the huge &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2214122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ProtecT trial&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K.&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;which showed that at 15 years, there were no significant mortality differences between men randomized between surveillance, surgery, and radiation. However, the untreated men had a higher risk of metastases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So most men with prostate cancer can live with it and not die from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial incentives and medical cultures partially explain the dramatic gap between academic and community practice. At major U.S. centers, surveillance rates now exceed 80% to 90%. But in community practice — where most men are treated — rates remain stubbornly below 50%. The U.S. system rewards intervention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The psychological burden of living with a cancer that you’re told not to treat is real. PSA anxiety becomes its own disease. MRIs, biopsies, and urology office visits can add emotional distress. We call it “SCANxiety” and “anxious surveillance.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An Italian oncologic psychologist warns these patients: “A prostatectomy doesn’t cure anxiety.” Emotional distress can be so severe that about 10% of U.S. men with low-risk prostate cancer ask for aggressive treatment, even though they are candidates for surveillance, based on a survey I presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, what I’ve learned from 15 years of observation is that stability over time is the most reliable indicator. My decade-long plateau reflects what researchers call “tumor indolence” — a biological equilibrium where low-grade cancer cells remain dormant. No one can explain how that happens, nor can they predict who will have that experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;23‑year follow‑up&lt;/a&gt; to the recently published European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer showed it took a major effort in a structured PSA screening program to prevent a single prostate cancer death. The study reported that PSA screening does modestly prevent prostate cancer deaths, but only after a large amount of testing, and with clear collateral harm. In rough terms, about 450 men must be invited into repeated PSA testing to prevent one prostate cancer death. And yet, that testing means several others are overdiagnosed, leading some to live with treatment‑related side effects from cancers that might never otherwise have surfaced. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need better tools to try to screen men without rushing them into aggressive surveillance, let alone aggressive treatment. PSAs could be stratified by family history, ethnicity, and comorbidities to help men make informed decisions. New artificial intelligence-based testing, such as Artera AI, is helping men avoid overtreatment and even predicting who will fare best on active surveillance. Experts around the world are still sorting out how best to screen for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think about whether I should have undergone PSA testing because of the chaos it has caused my family and me over the past decade and a half. Would my life have been better? Could I have avoided the stress and life insurance discrimination I faced because I opted not to treat my cancer?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I were to do it over again, I probably still would have gotten PSA screening because I generally am a compliant patient. But I would have asked more questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon, I hope, we’ll have better testing that shows which prostate cancers don’t need treatment — releasing many of us from this relentless treadmill of testing, scans, and biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Getting enough vitamin D really can help to protect you against the flu, a study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It revealed that people with a severe vitamin D deficiency were 33 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital with a respiratory tract infection than those who were receiving adequate amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/vitamin-d/"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is the only supplement recommended by the NHS for everyone during winter months, when exposure to sunlight, which the body uses to produce the nutrient, is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is already known to help regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which is vital for bone and muscle health, but experts also believe it may have antiviral properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, researchers from the Universities of Surrey, Oxford and Reading analysed data on 36,000 British adults to find out how levels of vitamin D in the body affected the rate of hospital admission with respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included a range of viral and bacterial illnesses such as flu, pneumonia and bronchitis. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/vitamin-d-could-sunshine-supplement-cut-covids-death-rate/"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of severe Covid, another respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this latest study – the largest to date – revealed that people with a severe vitamin D deficiency, classed as having a concentration below 15 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L) in the blood were 33 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory infections than those with optimal levels of more than 75nmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;

He was riding his dirt bike — he's been riding since he was 3 years old — when he was involved in a crash with a truck half a mile from his home in Rigby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was most likely killed on impact," Janice Bell, who is Freeman's aunt, told EastIdahoNews.com. "He had a helmet and all his riding gear on, and it didn't save him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 13, just days before the accident, Freeman turned 21. Bell said her nephew's best friend, who is in his late 60s, told him he needed to get a "big boy license" since he was now 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He took Friday off to go get his new driver's license … and he thought to himself (and told his mom), 'I'm an adult now, I should be a donor.' He wasn't a donor before," Bell explained. "When he went down there (to renew his license), he became a donor. That was Friday, and he was killed Sunday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the accident, Freeman was rushed to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where his family was told he wouldn't survive. The hospital found out he was a donor, and he was taken to the intensive care unit and put on life support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A donor honor walk took place Oct. 22, where Freeman, who had been declared brain dead, was wheeled down to the operating room as family, friends, coworkers and hospital employees lined the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Freeman's decision to become a donor, he helped save the lives of seven other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His heart went to another 21-year-old boy in Utah," said Bell, who said she hopes that person goes on to "do great things." "We don't know much about his other ones (like) his kidneys and lungs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Titus Freeman in the hospital. Freeman died after a dirt bike crash in October, but was able to save seven lives through organ donation. (Photo: Freeman family)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman not only helped others as a donor, but also by giving freely and serving those around him, which he did throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman worked for Knife River in Idaho Falls at the time of his death. Bell mentioned that he led a crew of men twice his age, and he'd get to work at 5 a.m. to start everybody's machines so they'd be warm for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He gave his whole crew lunch money (and gas money) all the time," she said. "When he passed away, they all paid him back in his front loader (that) was his machine. It was full of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman, who was born in Caldwell, has one older and one younger sister. Bell said Freeman had a challenging childhood, but he rose above it. At 19, he decided to buy a house in Rigby for his mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She not only loved him — every parent has a favorite, I don't care what they say. If they say they don't, they lie — but Titus, the reason he was her favorite is he also loved her the most," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman was a gifted baseball player who enjoyed playing disc golf and going fishing. When he was 12, he rebuilt a snowmobile, and most recently, he was rebuilding the engine in his truck. He got his truck running the day of his accident, but he never got a chance to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was such a good boy. Never in trouble in his life," Bell recalled. "He didn't go out drinking. He was in bed by 8 or 9. We call him the old man of the family. He was an anomaly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said losing her nephew was "the worst thing possible," but she is proud of the lives he was able to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to be religious, or you can be, but God — if there is a God — he did this. This must have been part of his plan … of some plan," she said. "I guess he had a plan for my beautiful, sweet nephew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman will be honored in Utah this summer when his name is added to the Celebration of Life Monument. The monument is a memorial and tribute to people both living and deceased who have donated organs, tissue, and eyes for either transplant or research in the Intermountain area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Most men don’t notice anything at first because early prostate cancer often doesn’t cause obvious symptoms. It quietly grows, sometimes for years, before it becomes big enough to bother you. And that’s part of the reason it can sneak up on people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer ranks as the third leading cancer site among males in India, following lung cancer and mouth cancer. Globally, about 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed every year, and those numbers are expected to rise as populations age. A 2024 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/indianjurol/fulltext/2024/07000/descriptive_epidemiology_of_prostate_cancer_in.7.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that “Prostate cancer incidence showed a rise after the age of 50, with a notable acceleration after age 64. The overall annual percentage change for prostate cancer incidence from 1982 to 2016 was 2.6. Around 43.0% of all prostate cancers were diagnosed at the distant metastatic stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d think that when something is becoming more common, people would talk about it more. But that isn’t really the case with prostate cancer in India. Even though prostate cancer is one of the cancers men get most often, a lot of guys either haven’t heard of it or don’t take it seriously until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big reason is that early signs don’t scream “something’s wrong.” Frequent peeing at night or a weak stream, most men just shrug it off as “just aging” or chalk it up to an enlarged prostate (which lots of older men get). The subtlety of symptoms means many folks don’t even think, maybe I should check this out with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the whole talk-about-it problem. In many Indian families, men aren’t used to chatting about urinary issues or anything that feels “private.” Shame or embarrassment kicks in, doctors don’t get a call, and the awareness just stays low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232704210_Awareness_Regarding_Risk_Factors_Symptoms_and_Treatment_Facilities_for_Cancer_in_Selected_States_of_India" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also show that general knowledge about cancers not linked to tobacco, prostate for instance, is very low in many parts of India.

These include a weak urinary stream, not emptying your bladder (urinary retention) and waking up more than 2 times per night to urinate (nocturia). The symptoms of BPH typically progress slowly over time. Prostate Cancer may present in similar ways during early stages but is typically detected by the following signs: blood in urine/sperm, persistent bone or back pain, sudden/unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and rapidly increasing symptoms rather than slow progression over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I wake up several times at night to urinate—how do I know if it’s just age or something serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for men to experience nocturia while they age, and waking up one to two times is considered normal, especially if it is an occasional occurrence. However, increased concern arises if the pattern becomes frequent enough (more than two to three times each night), appears suddenly or increases in severity and if any additional symptom accompanies it, weak urine stream, urinary retention, or blood in urine. Therefore, if the issues of nocturia and/or waking frequently at night are noticed, they should be evaluated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should I see a doctor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a person sees blood in their urine, semen, experiences unexplained weight loss or fatigue, they should contact their physician. Symptoms such as blood, new or increasing urinary symptoms, weak or interrupted stream of urine, or continuing pain in lower back, hips, and/or pelvis are an indication for consulting their physician. Additionally, symptoms disrupting sleep or work would also warrant a visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should men over 40 get checked for prostate issues, even if they feel fine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most physicians will begin routine screening for prostate cancer based on family history when the man reaches 50 years old, while those with a family history of prostate cancer may begin screening at an earlier age, between 40 and 45 years of age. A standard screening for prostate cancer consists of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and a digital rectal examination (DRE). Depending on what the initial PSA test results indicate and how risk factors (family history, ethnicity, etc.) for the individual, the possible frequency of screenings are from once a year to every 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If I have a family history of prostate cancer, how can I tell if minor symptoms are a warning?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family history has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, so even mild changes in urinary function should be evaluated by a doctor. During the evaluation, even though the initial thought may be that such changes are due to normal aging or BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia) it is important not to discount them as such. The earlier a person discusses any concerns with their doctor, has a PSA test performed, and follows up regularly, the greater the likelihood that prostate cancer will be detected early enough to allow for successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer doesn’t always announce itself loudly. When symptoms look like “normal aging,” it’s easy to ignore them. Doctors stress that paying attention to changes, and talking about them early, can make the difference between a cancer that’s treatable and one that’s already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>另一名弗吉尼亚州儿童在国外旅行后患上麻疹-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/01/20/measles-virginia-child-travel-contagious/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G7KH5SE2MVD5LHD3A6IYUKV37M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A week after reporting &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/01/12/virginia-child-measles-dc-maryland-exposure/" target="_blank"&gt;a child with measles&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the region while contagious, Virginia public health officials on Tuesday reported the case of another young child with the illness and warned of possible public exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:52:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNclZheUVTMUJ4Y0gzNHZqTmVMcEItSk11eDU0RGNyV2U5Tm10WXZjTVFINmhWVy1FYXVZRXVBRS1wQ2tYM1hINkNNNGp3LWhjOUhIX2k2c1d4ejZjRkNzNTg3YzBZam5hb3Y1dG9JQnB5bTJidEpVRXZtQk1fR3AxRzY3Wi0zNzhaQlBZSjJGbDU5cXRGS1Jv</guid></item><item><title>为什么混合运动可能是延长寿命的关键- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0y9pqe2zro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Why doing a mix of exercise could be the key to longer life&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-3adb3607-0 fkltMW"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-3adb3607-12 csUdlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-3adb3607-5 iMnQuR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-3adb3607-7 echTHp"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-3adb3607-8 dcphMW"&gt;Philippa Roxby and Joe McFadden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-3adb3607-9 dRohlg"&gt;Health reporters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c381/live/24a5d800-f615-11f0-a4e1-69699e3199a6.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A young woman wearing black leggings and a sleeveless top, with dark hair tied up, pulls hard on a tug-of-war rope in a gym with a grey floor.

            Ongoing measles outbreaks in multiple parts of the country are threatening the United States’ status as a nation that has eliminated the virus’ spread, but a CDC leader said Tuesday that the potential change is not a big concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000a3b6sdhriwcaa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuesday’s briefing was federal officials’ first on a continuing South Carolina outbreak that has totaled at least 646 cases, according to the state’s health department. There were roughly 760 cases in the West Texas outbreak&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;last year, making it one of the largest and deadliest measles outbreaks that the US has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000b3b6sytfdbt6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former Louisiana surgeon general who &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F11%2F25%2Fhealth%2Fcdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Caa6c86515ead44add49908de58746d8f%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639045454642681308%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=B%2BV87rgjTcxkmKRk7Nw1DwRFSm874pNkvp2c3WDVJkQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;ended &lt;/a&gt;some &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F11%2F25%2Fhealth%2Fcdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Caa6c86515ead44add49908de58746d8f%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639045454642711494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SAfcsgswhUQnU7%2Fgr6AZcibHrQLDUIbkIG3XL%2FkgAM8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in his state, argued at the briefing Tuesday that transmission between these states, as well as other outbreaks, has not been proved. But he also said that the US losing elimination status would not be a grave concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000c3b6suqnc97am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Losing elimination status … does not mean that the measles would be widespread, nor would it alter any key measles elimination strategies,” said Abraham, who joined CDC this month. He added that “vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles” but that he supports personal freedom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000d3b6syjbhcdln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US recorded 2,242 measles cases in 2025, according to CDC &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fdata-research%2Findex.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Caa6c86515ead44add49908de58746d8f%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639045454642732652%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=QHuY3n6beQNAykyHG9pjGTbTxn6kE3BtKpKl%2BVjGOYo%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, the most since 1991. The disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, and the Pan American Health Organization could decide to revoke that status when it meets in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000e3b6s3j3zjo17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked during the briefing whether he would see that as a significant loss, Abraham said, “not really.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000f3b6s2rpklxsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000g3b6suq6s7v5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He added that the CDC’s role is to support those communities and help minimize effects of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000h3b6simnp023b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The message that I certainly want to send as the deputy director here is, we’re open for business. We’re here to help, we understand concerns that those communities may have, and we’re willing to listen to alternatives” for treatment and prevention, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000i3b6syuyuyl7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ninety-three percent of cases recorded in the US last year, and 95% so far in 2026, had not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or had an unknown vaccination status, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000j3b6sacdxhiy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina’s outbreak, centered in the upstate region, is quickly on track to outpace last year’s outbreak in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000k3b6sms3bcjju@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the hundreds of confirmed cases, more than 500 people in South Carolina are in quarantine after they were exposed to a known measles case without the protection of vaccination, the state health department said, and more cases are expected to come from that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000l3b6srcea4xh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated students are in quarantine after exposures in more than a dozen schools — including elementary, middle and high schools. Exposures were also identified at Clemson University and Anderson University, both in the upstate region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000m3b6sonim9e8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who resigned in protest last year, said in another briefing Tuesday that trends suggest that the measles outbreak in South Carolina is “very, very active.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000n3b6si46ddbbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is in a growth phase, and it is in a very aggressively fast growth phase,” he said. “We are nowhere close to the place that we would need to be able to say that this is coming under control.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000o3b6s2ebphvq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of measles cases in the South Carolina outbreak  — nearly 90% — have been among children, and nearly all have been unvaccinated. Only about 2% of cases have been in people known to have been fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to data from the South Carolina state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000p3b6sso5a4rqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daskalakis, along with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and Dr. Annie Andrews from South Carolina, blamed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for a rising distrust of vaccinations that has allowed measles to spread so rapidly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000q3b6s4s5ru66v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What’s happening today with measles is absolutely public health malpractice, and it’s completely preventable,” said Green, who is also a physician. “It is public health malpractice to have thwarted confidence in vaccinations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000r3b6s54nvwbd6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkn6d9j5000s3b6s9iy8pczy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The worst part of it is, is it’s being encouraged by our public health leaders. It’s exactly the wrong thing to do,” Green said. “Let’s be clear: Kids will die.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not really,” said Ralph Abraham, a physician who formerly served as Louisiana’s surgeon general. “You know, it’s just the cost of doing business, with our borders being somewhat porous [and] global and international travel.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A country does not lose measles elimination status by having imported cases of the disease. With the virus circulating globally, such introductions will occur. Elimination status is lost if, after an introduction, a country is unable to stop ongoing transmission of the virus and circulation continues for a year or longer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abraham, who began his tenure at the CDC earlier this month, said that while the agency is helping states quell outbreaks however it can, some transmission is happening within communities where parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children and “that’s their personal freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You know, the president, the [health] secretary, we talk all the time about religious freedom, health freedom, personal freedom, and I think we have to respect those communities that choose to go somewhat of a different route,” Abraham said during a press conference called to discuss the ongoing measles outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As CDC, it is also our responsibility and our goal to support these communities in any way that we can to minimize the effects that measles would have, especially on the pediatric population,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In addition to assisting states, Abraham said he and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been promoting measles vaccination. “We are saying publicly and do believe that the MMR vaccine is a good vaccine to prevent the measles,” he said. (Measles vaccine is administered in a combination vaccine that also protects against mumps and rubella.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine advocates say Kennedy has not been publicly forceful about the importance of vaccination and has fanned anxieties about supposed vaccine risks that scientific evidence has shown to be unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The press conference was held on the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed measles case from the large West Texas outbreak that spread across multiple states and led to three deaths in 2025. As of Jan. 14, a total of 2,242 confirmed measles cases had been reported to the CDC in 2025, the highest single-year total since 1991. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Johns Hopkins University’s &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles tracker&lt;/a&gt; — which posts numbers more quickly than the CDC does — there have already been 336 confirmed cases in 2026. That is more cases in three weeks than the country recorded in most years in the period from 1993 to 2025. The number of measles cases in the U.S. started to decline in the early ’90s, a few years after health officials began recommending two doses of the MMR vaccine instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is currently unclear if some of the  present transmission traces back to the West Texas outbreak. A CDC scientist who also took part in the press conference said the agency is working to generate and study whole genome sequences of viruses from a variety of locations to try to determine if more recent cases signal ongoing spread or were triggered by new introductions of measles virus from abroad. Reporters were told the CDC scientist could not be identified by name as a condition of participating in the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was said to have eliminated measles in 2000, a status that meant the virus was no longer endemic — not spreading in an ongoing fashion — within the country’s borders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canada, which has been in the grips of a large measles outbreak that has spanned most of the country, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/10/measles-canada-americas-paho-who-elimination-status/"&gt;lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Pan American Health Organization announced that its regional verification commission, which is responsible for determining if countries in the region have eliminated measles, will meet on April 13 to study whether the United States and Mexico have lost their elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC scientist noted that the agency is working to compare whole genome sequences of a variety of viruses from across the country to try to determine if spread is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need time to be able to do that comprehensive analysis,” the official said, noting that the agency is working with academic and state labs on a new way of analyzing measles genetic data. “We’ve not had to use whole genome sequencing routinely in the past for measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firing rates in the motor and somatosensory cortex, on the other hand, looked radically different. This suggests there is a dynamic neural code defined by rapidly changing firing rate relationships amongst the neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks this means that the cingulate cortex manages the social purpose and context of the facial gesture, which is relatively stable. This may be where the brain integrates sensory cues—like the look of another monkey’s expression—with its own internal state to produce the right facial gesture for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic code areas implement this expression by driving individual muscles. “They’re driving the kinematics like ‘move this lip a millimeter to the left, now a millimeter to the right,’” Ianni explains. These constant miniscule movements of muscles are necessary because facial expressions are usually dynamic—macaques’ eyelids, lips, cheeks, and ears are constantly twitching and changing their position even if the end effect looks still from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The journey begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just the beginning of a long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There have been such fabulous, impressive advances in the field of assistive communication devices even since I started this project,” Ianni says, and points to neural prostheses developed by Maitreyee Wairagkar’s team Ars &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-neural-brain-implant-provides-near-instantaneous-speech/"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 as one of the examples. Building a similar neural prosthesis for decoding facial gestures is unlikely to happen overnight, though. We’re a rather long way away from truly restoring the ability to communicate through facial gestures to patients who lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ianni’s study is the first that recorded neurons producing facial gestures with multi-electrode arrays. This means we’ve only just begun to build up base science on the neural mechanism behind making faces. This is the point where neural speech decoding technology was in the late 1990s, and we still can’t make that reliable enough for regular clinical products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ianni remains hopeful. “I hope our work goes towards enabling the field, even the tiniest bit, towards more naturalistic and rich communication designs that will improve lives of patients after brain injury,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

Biological age differs from chronological age in that it reflects how well the body’s tissues and organ systems are working. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings, published today in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journals of Gerontology Series A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, draw on data from the nationally representative US Health and Retirement Study and look at multiple markers of biological aging in 3,884 adults aged 70 years and older in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After accounting for demographic and health differences, those who had received the shingles vaccine exhibited signs of slower biological aging, such as lower levels of inflammation and slower epigenetic aging, than those who had not been vaccinated. Epigenetic changes are changes in how cells behave over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers looked at seven different individual markers of biological aging: inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, immune function, cardiovascular function, neurodegeneration, epigenetic and transcriptomic (genetic expression and regulation) aging, and composite biological aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less inflammation, enhanced immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The shingles vaccine was significantly associated with less inflammation, slower epigenetic changes, and a lower overall composite biological aging score. Vaccination was also tied to increased immunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “epigenetic, transcriptomic and overall composite biological aging improvements were most pronounced within three years post-vaccination, with slower aging persisting beyond this window,” write the researchers. “The results support the hypothesis that shingles vaccination may influence key biological systems relevant to aging.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chronic, low-grade inflammation is implicated in numerous age-related conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and cognitive decline. “By helping to reduce this background inflammation—possibly by preventing reactivation of the virus that causes shingles—the vaccine may play a role in supporting healthier aging,” said Jung Ki Kim, PhD, research associate professor of gerontology and the study’s first author, in a USC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gero.usc.edu/2026/01/19/shingles-vaccine-slower-biological-aging/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results support the hypothesis that shingles vaccination may influence key biological systems relevant to aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study had some limitations. Because the data were cross-sectional, the researchers were unable to draw conclusions about change over time. They also note that the relationship between vaccine responses and inflammation may be bidirectional, meaning that lower baseline inflammation can improve vaccine responses, and that other unmeasured confounders might exist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coauthor Eileen Crimmins, PhD, AARP chair in gerontology, emphasized that, while more research is needed, the results are compelling. “Our study adds to a growing body of work suggesting that vaccines may play a role in healthy aging strategies beyond solely preventing acute illness,” she said in the release. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s rare for studies to follow people for such a long period, so this offers a unique insight into how the body changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any age, exercise boosts physical ability and slows the inevitable decline in strength and fitness as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2QmWhA2iU7mTUGCv6HoL2K slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2d35bc3a-ca34-4a5d-82f5-133c01f81ddb" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-research-mean-3"&gt;What does the research mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="519c616f-6aaa-4b04-bb01-c272db00599f"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="3cf3d433-344e-4ffb-8a78-3a79790c3afa"&gt;Interestingly, the decline occurred regardless of how well-trained people were before 35. But, post-35, decline continues gradually, says researchers, which then speeds up with advancing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “encouraging evidence” tells us that exercise can slow this process down and help increase physical capacity by 5-10%, which also slows decline in performance, but doesn’t completely prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means it’s never too late to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-did-yoga-every-day-for-a-month-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-heres-what-happened-to-my-body"&gt;start a yoga routine&lt;/a&gt;, take up &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-pilates-beginner"&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, or even head to your local gym to lift weights.

&lt;p id="d3b386eb-c5a2-42ab-a72e-eb20bda93d05"&gt;Small changes in exercise, sleep and dietary habits could do wonders for people's health and possibly extend their overall lifespan, a large U.K. study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Jan. 13 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sought to find the smallest possible lifestyle improvements that could measurably lengthen people's lifespans. The researchers searched within data collected from almost 60,000 people in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cohort, a repository of medical and lifestyle data from hundreds of thousands of U.K. adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="d3b386eb-c5a2-42ab-a72e-eb20bda93d05-2"&gt;The team linked the participants' documented habits to their theoretical overall longevity and health, as calculated using statistical modelling. They found that people who slept as little as five extra minutes daily, engaged in just two extra minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, and added a half serving of vegetables per day tended to live significantly longer than the worst performers — meaning those whose sleep habits, exercise, and nutrition patterns put them in the bottom 5% of the overall cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="24284f69-459c-4a89-b5d1-263a993cbfcf"&gt;The former group had an extra year of overall lifespan compared with the latter, according to the statistical model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that adding a few minutes of exercise or sleep and making small changes to diet will guarantee an extra year of life, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/stephen-burgess" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/stephen-burgess" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stephen Burgess&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a statistician at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By itself, this study does not prove that these habits improve health," he cautioned. "They model what might happen to our life span if changing these factors does improve health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the data suggested that improvements across several aspects of well-being are "greater than the sum of their parts," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-koemel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-koemel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicholas Koemel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and research fellow at The University of Sydney, told Live Science. For instance, to gain one additional year of lifespan through sleep alone, the study suggested a person would have to sleep an extra 25 minutes per night — a luxury many cannot afford. But very small improvements in sleep, exercise and diet may have a significant combined effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zKdfeaCtxC2MVDRdMiNnph" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zKdfeaCtxC2MVDRdMiNnph slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koemel said the findings suggest that "healthy habits work better as a package."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each one of our behaviors has an interlinking impact on what we do," he said. "If we have a poor night's sleep, we oftentimes eat differently, we move differently. And we see that across all of these different behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the model, the study participants with the most optimal combination of these behaviors — at least 40 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, seven to eight hours of sleep per day, and an overall healthy diet — were predicted to live an extra nine years, overall, and live nine extra years in good health, compared with the poorest 3% of performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By their very design, studies like these, known as cohort studies, need to be taken with a grain of salt. They compare two groups retroactively rather than asking people to change their habits and seeing how that change affects their health. As such, they can never conclusively prove that one particular change caused an associated effect; they can only draw a link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, sleep and exercise habits were measured for only up to a week in the UK Biobank cohort, and the data assume that people kept up those same habits in the long run. Similarly, diet was assessed only at the beginning of the study, rather than monitored over time. So it's possible that the participants changed their habits after these assessments were taken, which would weaken the possibility that their habits improved their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this leaves room for the possibility that it was not these lifestyle differences, but rather some other factor that wasn't measured, that caused the improvement in lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a5ba22b1-000d-4420-a033-cfa5f2452dc1"&gt;It may be, for instance, that one group is wealthier, and it so happens that this makes it easier for that group to exercise, sleep well and eat well. But ultimately, that difference is partially explained by the wealth, not only the behaviors, Burgess explained. It is also possible wealthy people might live in a less polluted area than poorer people, which could contribute to the difference in lifespan. There's no way of telling from this study alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overall message that small changes in these factors are likely to be beneficial is probably correct," Burgess said. "But whether the exact numbers are accurate or not is less clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koemel agreed, saying that more research is needed to confirm the findings. Still, the idea that even tiny changes in lifestyle could have large effects could offer an interesting alternative for those looking to improve their overall well-being, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New Year's resolutions oftentimes fail because we're pushing too hard," he argued. "We're trying to go to the gym every day. We're trying to be perfect." This research suggests there may be a "different path to get from A to Z," by making smaller changes across several areas of well-being that can build up to healthier habits while improving overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="2fe1ecc1-bfc2-4414-bd87-12c99c35e585"&gt;

A shy boy who was bullied in school, he found that liquor helped him to become outgoing and the life of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His drinking escapades, which often resulted in vomiting, were dismissed in his early years as just part of being young. But later, when friends got careers and slipped into adult lives, his close relationship with alcohol continued, and sometimes got out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Charles Knowles, author of Why We Drink, is a professor of surgery at universities in London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles was never focused on how much he drank, although at college he said he could easily sink 15 pints a night. But he found it impossible to stop drinking once he started, and would wake up the next morning craving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There would, however, be periods of abstinence. He said he never drank at, or just before, work, taking his responsibility to patients very seriously. But for at least seven years before his vacation to Florida, he had been trying, and failing, to quit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the book, Knowles described how he was finally able to quit, and detailed the impact alcohol has on our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, he added that he is not against alcohol. Knowles said it had benefitted his life in many ways, including helping him socialize with band mates and meet his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His book comes amid a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15442877/alcohol-dietary-guidelines-consume-less.html"&gt;shift in guidance on alcohol consumption &lt;/a&gt;in the US after federal officials said Americans should 'consume less alcohol for better overall health.' The previous guidelines said men should not consume more than two drinks per day, while women should not consume more than one drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are Knowles's findings on how the drug impacts the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Heart and circulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles, similar to many drinkers, experienced a rapid heart rate while drinking alcohol, an effect triggered when the drug dilates blood vessels and forces the heart to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 17 years on from his last drink, however, he feels he is 'out of the woods' when it comes to suffering the heart health drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have linked drinking to a higher risk of stroke or heart failure. But some say it's not permanent. Research suggests that the heart health risks associated with drinking decline after abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also exacerbate high blood pressure, the most common health condition in the US, by boosting levels of a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there's bad news for those who believe a glass or two of red wine is beneficial: Resveratrol, the compound in red wine once believed to be heart-healthy, is not actually shown to have any benefits, Knowles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have linked drinking to a higher risk of stroke or heart failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Liver and pancreas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a few days of heavy drinking, fats can build up in the liver - the organ that works to filter alcohol out of the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, and if drinking continues, these can cause fatty liver disease, raising the risk of scarring to the liver, which reduces its ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more serious cases, the condition has also been linked to liver cancer and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles underlined, however, that someone would need to consume three alcohol drinks a day to cause these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Stomach and intestines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol consumption can also irritate the stomach lining, causing vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while binge drinking - consuming more than five drinks on the same occasion for men or more than four for women - alcohol can also enter the bowels rapidly and irritate the lining, causing indigestion, constipation and, possibly, incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Obesity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor diet, little exercise and poor sleep can cause obesity, but Knowles warned that drinking alcohol can, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has a high calorie content. A pint of beer contains around 200 calories - the same as a KitKat or two chocolate chip cookies - while a bottle of wine has 700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can disrupt sleep too, causing hunger hormones to go haywire and prompting someone to eat more food the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-8690485/People-drink-just-ONE-bottle-beer-small-wine-day-25-likely-obese.html"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found people who drank a bottle of beer or a small glass of wine every day are up to 25 percent more likely to be obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who drink a bottle of beer or small glass of wine each day are up to 25 percent more likely to be obese, a study of 26 million people found (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1988, the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared alcohol a group 1 carcinogen, putting it on a par with asbestos, radiation and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has now been linked to at least seven cancers. This includes cancer in organs that come into direct contact with alcohol, such as the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus and colon, and those impacted by its effects, including the pancreas, liver and breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12664783/"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt;, the US Surgeon General warned that women who drank two alcoholic beverages per day had a 15 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For colon cancer, which is currently surging among young adults, a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coloncancerfoundation.org/alcohol-destroying-your-liver-and-colon-increasing-your-risk-of-early-crc/"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; warned women who were moderate drinkers - equivalent to one drink per day - had a 47 percent higher risk of colon cancer than those who do not drink. Among men, moderate drinkers had a 26 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Fertility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking has also been linked to problems with male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immediately after drinking, men may struggle to get an erection. The alcohol can disrupt testosterone and cortisol levels in men, which can cause the low libido or erection issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, alcohol can damage sperm production, leading to fewer and lower quality sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew university students who, back in the day, had tried to donate sperm to make some additional money and had failed because of their lifestyle involving alcohol and smoking,' Knowles told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol has been associated with several cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Why We Drink Too Much: The Impact of Alcohol on Our Bodies and Culture by Dr Charles Knowles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Brain and spinal cord&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles warned that alcohol is toxic to nerves and could even shrink the size of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220304090349.htm"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on 36,600 people found that even those drinking relatively modestly, about one or two drinks per day, had reductions in grey matter, used for processing information, and fewer connections in white matter, which allows for communication between different areas of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it wasn't clear whether this has a serious effect on function. Knowles doesn't believe so, citing his own study that suggests people are still able to function normally even with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did note that there is a risk that drinking large amounts of alcohol could lead to a condition called alcoholic dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He emphasized that this required a lot (three or more drinks per day) of alcohol consumption over the course of at least 40 years. It is not clear exactly how much based on reports, but alcoholic dementia has been detected in homeless communities among those who rely heavily on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drinking, alcohol causes spikes in the feel-good hormones in the brain. But afterward, it causes them to crash, leaving people feeling anxious or depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowles struggles with depression himself and takes antidepressants, but said he did not believe his was linked to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said depression runs &lt;span&gt;in his family and that his mood normally was negative (noting that this may have been something that drove him to drink in the first place).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Knowles said that there is a risk that drinking large amounts of alcohol could lead to a condition called alcoholic dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Are there any benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his personal experience with drinking, Knowles insisted that he is not anti-alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you look back on my life, would I change the first 10 years of drinking? No,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I mean, a friend of mine wrote to me, and he said, "think of all the experiences we had." And then listed a number of crazy things that had happened. None of this would have happened without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I mean, I also met my wife drinking, and we have two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I look back, it is difficult because, for many people, alcohol is fun and, provided it is kept in check, it can lead to beneficial outcomes in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why we've been manufacturing alcohol for 15,000 years and continue to consume it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Why We Drink Too Much: The Impact of Alcohol on Our Bodies and Culture by Dr Charles Knowles is published by Celadon Books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;South Carolina's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/south-carolina-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-as-cases-rise-in-the-state/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; continues to grow, with officials on Tuesday announcing an additional 88 cases in the state. There have been 646 cases of measles reported there since October, according to the &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-88-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-646" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;South Carolina Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of measles cases in the United States has led to concern that the U.S. will lose its &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-risks-losing-measles-elimination-status-for-first-time-in-over-2-decades/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A country is considered as having eliminated measles if there are "no locally transmitted measles infections or outbreaks lasting 12 months or longer," according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina outbreak is centered around Spartanburg County. Recent public exposure locations include multiple schools, a Publix supermarket and the South Carolina State Museum, according to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of the cases [are] occurring in the under-vaccinated, close-knit community in the Spartanburg area," Dr. Ralph Lee Abraham, the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a phone briefing. He said the CDC "continues to investigate transmission patterns and is working closely with South Carolina health officials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. In some cases, it can cause severe infections that lead to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hospitalization and death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and health officials say the measles vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination MMR vaccine in childhood, is highly effective and safe. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccination-rates-us-counties-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vaccination rates for measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have dropped in recent years, with many areas falling below the herd immunity threshold experts say is necessary to keep the disease from circulating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the United States saw over 2,240 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — the most in 30 years, according to the CDC. Many of those cases were connected to an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-texas-trump-administration-cdc-response/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Jan. 13, the U.S. has recorded 171 measles nationwide in 2026, the CDC said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;agency plans&lt;/a&gt; to release new numbers for measles cases on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have faith that we're in a place where we can say that we're handling measles very well. Texas was an example. South Carolina is now the new example," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, an infectious disease physician and former leader of immunization and respiratory disease strategy at the CDC. "South Carolina is another example of what we see when there's low vaccination rates and a public health system that's not really able to robustly address what's happening." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles elimination status at risk  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization, the regional office for the World Health Organization in the Americas, will meet in April to review measles elimination status for the United States and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada lost its measles elimination status in November, 27 years after it was considered eliminated in that country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. officially eliminated measles in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles elimination status is a milestone for a country," Daskalakis said. "It indicates that its public health system is healthy and able to respond to measles, which is the most infectious virus that we know. If you can handle measles, the implication is that you have the infrastructure to be able to handle a lot of other infectious diseases as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis said he was skeptical that the U.S. will maintain its elimination status in 2026, which could open the door for further outbreaks of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-vaccine-mandates-united-states-measles-polio-mmr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously eliminated or rare diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this is our vital sign, we're in the ICU," he said. "The future could be that we are going to be looking at measles becoming part of every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Staying safe amid measles outbreaks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing a person can do to prevent getting the measles is get vaccinated, Daskalakis said. One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles. The complete two-dose series is 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond getting vaccinated, people should follow recommendations from public health officials, stay home if they are feeling unwell and stay away from people who have the measles to prevent further transmission of the disease, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in an area where measles is prevalent and you have symptoms, seek medical attention, Daskalakis said. Early signs of measles include a cough, fever and runny nose, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Always talk to your doctor," Daskalakis said. "This is what they live for: Preventing preventable disease." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Last week, we broke down a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-rfk-africa-vaccines"&gt;major debacle&lt;/a&gt; unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to the trial protocols, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the &lt;a href="https://arkansasworker.com/racism-imperialism-and-medical-practices-the-tuskegee-and-guatemalan-syphilis-studies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “It is wretched.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;At the time of our writing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; had reported&lt;/a&gt; that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2021/on-background-is-common-journalism-lingo-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;no such arrangement&lt;/a&gt; — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200430225749/https://africacdc.org/about-us/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;official health agency&lt;/a&gt; of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-coming-of-age-of-the-africa-centers-for-disease-control/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 testing hub&lt;/a&gt; for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11474706/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/joint-press-release-vaccine-doses-allocated-to-9-african-countries-hardest-hit-by-mpox-surge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/ethiopia/news/who-and-africa-cdc-consolidate-ties-advance-public-health-africa" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;collaboration agreement&lt;/a&gt; to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a &lt;a href="https://ask.un.org/faq/140935" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specialized agency&lt;/a&gt; of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to remember your first birthday party. You can probably conjure up a vague image based on a photograph your parents showed you a thousand times. That mental image is most likely false. The truth is that most people barely remember anything before their 3rd birthday. It’s a phenomenon called infantile amnesia, and it’s one of the great paradoxes of being human. We spend our early years soaking up information like sponges, yet our brains seem determined to hit the “delete” button on almost all of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a long time, neuroscientists treated this forgetting as a cognitive glitch or a simple lack of brainware maturity. But a new study suggests that infantile amnesia is actually a feature, not a bug—and it’s being run by an unexpected crew of cellular janitors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out that microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, might be actively scrubbing away our earliest memories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically think of the immune system as our body’s defense force, hunting down pathogens and clearing out debris. But in the brain, immune cells have a day job that looks a lot more like IT management. Microglia are specialized macrophages that account for about 10-15% of cells found within the brain. During the rapid development of infancy, they are busy pruning synapses—the connections between neurons—to refine brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Trinity College Dublin wanted to know if this pruning process was responsible for the loss of early memories. They worked with infant mice, which, like humans, naturally forget fearful experiences they learned as babies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Erika Stewart and Tomás Ryan, trained 17-day-old mice to associate a specific box with a mild foot shock. Under normal conditions, these mice would forget this scary experience by the time they were 25 days old. Essentially, they would grow out of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when the scientists fed the mice minocycline—an antibiotic that inhibits microglial activity—something remarkable happened. The mice didn’t forget. Even eight days later, a lifetime in mouse infancy, the treated mice froze in fear when placed back in the box. By telling the immune system to take a break, the researchers had effectively stopped infantile amnesia in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glowing-traces-of-the-past"&gt;Glowing Traces of the Past&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prove that the memories were physically still there, the team used a technique called genetic “tagging” to make the specific neurons holding the memory—known as &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/memories-stored-in-specific-brain-cells-22032012/"&gt;“engrams”&lt;/a&gt;—glow with a fluorescent protein (EYFP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ml-form-align-center"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ml-form-embedWrapper embedForm"&gt;
            
            &lt;div class="zme-signup-container" id="zme-main-container"&gt;
                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Thank you! One more thing...&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;This allowed them to literally see the memory trace in the brain. They focused on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a hub for context memory, and the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the mice with active microglia (the ones that forgot), the memory engrams were less active during recall. But in the mice treated with the inhibitor, the memory engrams in the amygdala lit up with activity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The memory files hadn’t been corrupted; they had just been protected from the shredder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked closer at the cellular level, they saw that inhibiting the microglia changed how these immune cells interacted with the memory neurons. In the treated mice, there were fewer contact points between the microglia and the engram cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Essentially, by keeping the “memory managers” at arm’s length, the memory was preserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, can be considered the ‘memory managers’ in the brain. Our paper highlights their role in infantile amnesia specifically, and indicates that common mechanisms may exist between infantile amnesia and other forms of forgetting – both in everyday life and in disease,” explained Dr. Stewart, now a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-autism-connection"&gt;The Autism Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t stop at just blocking forgetting. The researchers also looked at the flip side: what happens when the brain’s immune system is primed too early?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a known link between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental conditions like autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). In previous work, this same team discovered that male mouse offspring born to mothers with activated immune systems (a model called MIA, or maternal immune activation) don’t experience infantile amnesia. They remember things they should forget. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this new study, they found that these MIA mice had microglia that looked “blunted,” with reduced phagocytic (eating) activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was as if their cellular janitors were on strike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the twist: When the researchers gave these MIA mice minocycline very early in life (from birth to day 14), it seemingly “reset” their microglia. The treatment restored their ability to forget. It suggests that for the brain to develop typical forgetting patterns, the immune system needs to be functioning within a “Goldilocks” zone—not too active, but not too dormant either. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-feature-not-a-bug"&gt;A Feature, Not a Bug&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why would evolution design a brain that deletes its own data? Senior author Prof. Tomás Ryan suggests that forgetting is a crucial part of how we learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infantile amnesia is possibly the most ubiquitous form of memory loss in the human population,” Ryan notes. “Most of us remember nothing from our early years of life, despite having so many novel experiences during these formative years. This is an overlooked topic in memory research, precisely because we all accept it as a fact of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ryan adds, “But what if those memories are still present in the brain? Increasingly, the memory field views forgetting as a ‘feature’ of the brain rather than a ‘bug’. It seems that the brain is filing away the neuronal units that store memory, the engrams, for later use. Microglia seem to be functioning in the brain to help organise how engrams are stored and expressed across the lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications here are huge. If we can chemically toggle the ability to access early memories in mice, we are one step closer to understanding how memory persistence works in humans. It also raises fascinating questions about neurodiversity. Ryan notes, “It will be interesting and important to identify humans that don’t experience infantile amnesia. To learn how their brains work, and understand their experience of early childhood education.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, if you can’t remember your second birthday, don’t worry. It just means your microglia were doing their job, diligently sculpting your brain to be ready for the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But the label has been enthusiastically adopted by conservative, right-leaning women across the country. Crunchy content of today is more likely to feature calls to prayer, protecting arms and patriotism than to progressivism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/2026/01/20/crunchy-moms-maha-photos/88266029007/" data-t-l="⚑g:l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - 'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_i_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="18"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_rightArrow"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" aria-label="Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio. See a day in their life."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And one topic, more than any other, has come to define the new crunchy moms movement: vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the crunchy moms movement swells, it is emblematic of an increasingly mainstream embrace of vaccine skepticism and a broader lack of trust in established medical science that is alarming scientists and experts in public health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and author of “The Deadly Rise of Anti Science,” decries what he calls a convergence of “snake oil salesmen” from the health and wellness industry with the Trump Administration and Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement. This alliance, Hotez says, is wreaking immeasurable damage to Americans’ trust in science and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rate of diseases once considered essentially under control, if not eradicated, has been climbing in recent years in the United States as vaccine rates have fallen. Measles, for example, has reached its &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2026/01/07/us-sees-highest-measles-case-count-in-decades-as-outbreaks-grow/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;highest rate of infection in decades&lt;/a&gt;, as outbreaks sicken and kill children across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activism is now a leading lethal force in the United States,” Hotez said. “And now it’s spilling over into childhood immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A movement builds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Within the crunchy moms are women who say they or their children have suffered legitimate harm from vaccines. But also flocking to the movement, and in far greater numbers, are women who question everything from the established benefits of vaccines, to how they are approved and tested, to their reported side effects, without their own personal experiences of harm resulting from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio just outside Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Homeschool lessons are given at the LoConti residence, Oct. 14, 2025, in Westlake, Ohio.

Bright says childhood vaccines made her daughter sick, pushing her towards “alternative” research on the vaccine industry. LoConti’s children never suffered such a fate, but nevertheless she’s been pulled in by Bright’s experiences, and stories from moms like her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Over several interviews, Bright and LoConti spoke passionately about the research they have conducted into everything from seed oils to colloidal silver, to double-blind placebo-controlled trials for vaccines. They laid out their reasoning for not trusting vaccines specifically, and the medical and pharmaceutical industries more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For us, it's hard to know who to trust because everything's so intertwined and there's so much money and there's so much behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's nobody asking these questions until now,” LoConti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's a sentiment echoed from the very top of the American government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perhaps the most well-known critic of vaccines, &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-autotag="1eef402e-8d6b-4ca9-ae4b-46a1674522c3" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, is the most powerful healthcare official in the country.

It started with carefully reading the labels on the products they had long enjoyed, from cereals, to cookies, to milk. Once they started doing research into the impact those foods might have on their children, what they found shocked and appalled them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747926007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-74.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747926007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-74.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Cleveland's West Side Market serves as a weekly destination for April LoConti, upper-right corner, and her friend, Brandy Bright, refelected in glass at right, who both work to champion clean living – a lifestyle as free as possible of toxins and chemicals.

Today’s crunchy universe has its own lexicon, myriad complicated theories and counter-theories, and a legion of skeptics and soothsayers, many with scientific or pseudoscientific backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I look back at the food that I used to feed my teenagers and I'm like, ‘Oh my gosh, I would never feed that to my child now,’” Bright said. “And the amount of moms that reach out to us on social media when we talk about this that are like, ‘I had no clue those ingredients that were in this food I was buying for my kids.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the moms investigated the products they and their children were putting in their bodies, their research quickly took them into the subculture of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine research and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That world was primed to receive crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;‘Just asking questions’ about vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For decades before Bright and LoConti found it, the anti-vaccine movement had been going from strength to strength, picking up millions of followers while developing its pitch and public relations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic supercharged the anti-vaccine rhetoric machine, pulling in millions more Americans angry about masking mandates and social distancing rules. Mainstream politicians, from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene to Florida Gov. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/ron-desantis/" data-autotag="a3bd4397-a472-4c2f-b512-dfd74c06e59c" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt;, helped spur the movement from the fringes to the mainstream – spreading conspiracy theories and debunked science to bring in more and more vaccine-skeptical acolytes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Suspicious and angry from what they had found out about the food and drink they had trusted, Bright and LoConti fell headlong into this anti-vaccine movement, spending hours watching documentaries and interviews with scientists and doctors ostracized from the scientific community for their views. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747808007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-40.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747808007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-40.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Brandy Bright cooks homemade sourdough tortillas for taco Tuesday night at the LoConti home, Oct. 14, 2025, in Westlake, Ohio.

Let's compare. Let's ask the questions, let's do the research,” Bright said. “Something's not right – we don't know what it is, so let's figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti had followed a familiar path that millions of mothers like them were also going down. Concerns about their children’s food and other consumption led to concerns and skepticism about what had been injected into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the large corporations had lied to them about food and drink being healthy, they reasoned, the monolithic pharmaceutical companies were probably doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I've never been anti-vaccine'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In an attempt to understand what future changes may be coming to America's vaccine landscape, USA TODAY sat down for an exclusive interview with Kennedy at the Health and Human Services office in downtown Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In a wide-ranging conversation, Kennedy clarified his stance on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I've never been anti-vaccine," Kennedy said. "I've said that thousands and thousands of times. "My concern is that we should set proper safety tests for vaccines so that people understand, and we are able to understand, the risk profile for these products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts like Hotez consider statements like this misleading. Vaccines have already proven their worth because billions of people have taken them and side effects remain vanishingly rare, they argue. Vaccines that have been around for decades were tested originally, and have essentially been tested ever since, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's not good enough for Kennedy and his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy&lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/rfk-jr-flu-shot-vaccine/88220106007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; told USA TODAY that he questions whether he, himself, was injured by annual flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which he took until the mid 1990s and then later stopped entirely in 2005. The health secretary has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological voice disorder, that he says may have resulted from his vaccines, although the &lt;a href="https://dystonia-foundation.org/what-is-dystonia/common-misunderstandings/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has said vaccines don't cause the condition and can actually protect against some forms of dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Do I know that it was caused by my annual flu shot? I have no idea," he said. "It's a potential culprit that I cannot rule out, but I can't prove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy pledged to keep delving into the concerns of mothers like Bright and LoConti, who have lost their faith in the government to tell the truth about complicated medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"My job as HHS secretary is to tell the truth to people and then to let them to make up their own minds," he said. "And so we've implemented new policies here where we don't tell 'noble lies.' We tell the truth, whatever the impacts are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Trusting science, but only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a fundamental contradiction in the logic employed by crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to established science, and what the experts believe, the scientific community largely has their back when it comes to their views on &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/seed-oils-are-they-actually-toxic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, or trans fats, or how much screen time their kids should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But when it comes to vaccines, that support from the established scientific community all but evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and Lo Conti like to say they are simply asking questions – questions they need to ask about everything from the nutritional benefits of Oreos to the value of the measles vaccine – because nobody has ever really questioned these things before, at least not with real, honest American skepticism, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that’s not really true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Select a few “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” videos about nutrition – whether raising concerns about heavy metals in foods, or questioning the value of food dyes that are legal in the United States but banned in Europe – and it soon becomes clear that there are actually legitimate scientific concerns underpinning those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti question these things precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they can quickly and easily look up research from large, established scientific institutions that have also asked the same questions many times before. There are dozens of published scientific papers digging into the same concerns the crunchy moms have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to vaccines, however, the body of research is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Howard, an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at New York University who has written two books on the anti-vaccine movement, summed up one inherent challenge in researching vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One problem with vaccines is the good that they do is invisible, right?” Howard told USA TODAY. “No one ever comes home and says, ‘Boy, my kid didn't get measles today because of the vaccine,’ or ‘My kid didn't get polio today because of the vaccine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There exist vast troves of data showing how many lives vaccines have saved across the world, Howard said. Study after study has concluded that vaccines have helped eradicate certain diseases while controlling and mitigating others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio." data-c-credit="Andrew Dolph, Akron Beacon Journal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But for almost every legitimate study that concludes vaccines are beneficial, there are now counterparts that concerned mothers like Bright and LoConti can find online that raise concerns and fear about vaccines, Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The key difference, however, is that the vaccine-skeptical studies Bright and LoConti and other crunchy moms point to do not come from the same established sources that provide much of the fear and skepticism that drive their concerns about food and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Traditionally, scientists and doctors who have questioned vaccine safety, and even the benefits of vaccines, have quickly become pariahs. Their studies, documentaries and papers are often debunked, ridiculed and dismissed by experts on vaccines and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, Howard said, to become an anti-vaxxer, or even a vaccine-skeptic, one has to tangibly choose to believe a largely discredited subset of research that is not academically or scientifically sound, over what the vast majority of scientists have long established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s more than just skepticism, Howard said, it’s a form of wilful denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Nothing is wrong with being skeptical and there's nothing wrong with asking questions; the problem is when you don't accept the answers,” Howard said. “Anyone who now says that they are just asking questions about this sort of thing is not doing that.

			&lt;p&gt;Many people across cultures grow up hearing that cold weather makes you sick. Going outside without a coat, breathing in cold air, sleeping in a chilly room, getting caught in cold rain or snow, or simply feeling chilled are often blamed for causing colds or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This belief feels true to many people because illness often follows cold exposure. However, modern research shows that the connection between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cold-weather-49689"&gt;cold weather&lt;/a&gt; and illness is more nuanced than the idea that cold directly causes disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold temperatures themselves &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-winter-makes-you-more-vulnerable-to-colds-a-public-health-nurse-explains-the-science-behind-the-season-244803#"&gt;do not cause&lt;/a&gt; infections. Instead, they influence a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors that make people more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, especially &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17705968/"&gt;during the winter months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-cold-weather-cause-colds-heres-why-you-really-get-sick-in-winter"&gt;Does Cold Weather Cause Colds? Here's Why You Really Get Sick in Winter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colds and flu are caused by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, not by cold air. Viruses such as rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses spread from person to person through respiratory droplets or physical contact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33753932/"&gt;regardless of the temperature outside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg" alt="illustration of a virus" class="wp-image-189500 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/red_virus_particle_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189500" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Seasonal illnesses are typically caused by viruses. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD4GJySqjs/"&gt;Shutter2U/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, rates of respiratory infections consistently increase during colder seasons in many parts of the world – a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-people-get-more-colds-in-winter/"&gt;pattern that has been observed globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seasonal pattern is partly due to the way that cold temperatures and low humidity affect viruses in the environment. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2034399/"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that many respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, survive longer and remain infectious for extended periods in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7454058/"&gt;cold, dry conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air also causes tiny droplets released when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze to evaporate quickly. This creates smaller particles that stay suspended in the air longer, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/coronavirus-why-cold-winter-weather-makes-it-harder-to-fight-respiratory-infections"&gt;increasing the chance&lt;/a&gt; that others will inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, cold, dry air helps viruses persist in the environment and improves their chances of reaching another person's respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold air also &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;affects how the body defends itself&lt;/a&gt; against infection. Breathing in cold air lowers the temperature inside the nose and airways, which can trigger vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction means the narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lining of the nose and airways, this reduced blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036013232400221X#:%7E:text=The%20respiratory%20tract%20is%20mainly%20innervated%20by,nasal%20mucosa%20and%20adenoids%20%5B%2064%2C%2065%5D"&gt;can weaken local immune responses&lt;/a&gt; that normally help detect and eliminate viruses before they cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure and cold-related stress can also interfere with the normal function of the airways, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031196/#:%7E:text=For%20chronic%20patients%20with%20precarious%20respiratory%20balances,are%20both%20able%20to%20destabilize%20the%20patient"&gt;particularly in people&lt;/a&gt; with sensitive respiratory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these effects can suppress the body's first lines of defence in the nose and throat. Cold air does not create viruses, but it can make it easier for viruses to gain a foothold once exposure occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crowds and close contact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal changes in human behaviour and indoor environments &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323431"&gt;also play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Cold weather encourages people to spend more time indoors, often in close contact with others. Crowded spaces with poor ventilation allow virus-containing droplets to build up in the air, making transmission between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876"&gt;people more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During winter, reduced sunlight exposure leads to lower production of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D in the skin. Vitamin D is involved in regulating immune function, and low levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3074219/"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; weaker immune responses. Indoor heating, while essential for comfort, dries out the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air can dry the lining of the nose and throat, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8664457/"&gt;reducing the effectiveness of mucus&lt;/a&gt;. Mucus normally traps viruses and helps move them out of the airways, a process known as mucociliary clearance. When this system is impaired, viruses have an easier time infecting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold weather can be especially challenging for people with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis, which is commonly known as hay  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="189492" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6031646/"&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; (research that examines patterns of disease in populations) show that cold conditions can worsen symptoms and increase functional impairment in these people. This can intensify the effects of respiratory infections when they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the evidence paints a clear picture of what cold weather does and does not do. Cold temperatures are linked with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.15252/emmm.202115352"&gt;higher rates of respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt;, including influenza and coronaviruses, particularly in temperate regions during winter. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151"&gt;Laboratory and environmental studies&lt;/a&gt; show that viruses survive longer and spread more easily in cold, dry air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01423-3/fulltext"&gt;can also weaken immune defences&lt;/a&gt; in the nose and airways, including reduced mucus movement and decreased antiviral activity in nasal tissues. Behavioural and environmental factors typical of winter, such as indoor crowding, poor ventilation, and reduced sunlight, leading to lower vitamin D levels, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/17/3842"&gt;further increase the risk of viral spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the evidence does not support is the idea that simply being cold, such as stepping outside without a coat, directly causes a cold or flu. Instead, cold weather acts as a risk amplifier. It creates conditions that help viruses survive, spread, and overcome the body's defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this distinction has practical value. Improving indoor ventilation and maintaining adequate humidity during winter can reduce transmission risk. Supporting immune health, including maintaining adequate vitamin D levels, may also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health messages are most effective when they focus on how viruses spread through contact and respiratory droplets, rather than reinforcing the myth that cold exposure alone causes illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, cold weather and illness are linked, but not in the way many people assume. Cold temperatures do not cause infections by themselves. Instead, they shape the biological, environmental, and social conditions that allow respiratory viruses to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this complexity helps explain why colds and flu peak in winter and supports more effective strategies for prevention, while dispelling a simple but misleading belief about cold weather and sickness.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272935/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since a measles outbreak began in West Texas, and international health authorities say they will meet in April to determine if the U.S. has lost its measles-free designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the vaccine-preventable virus has regained a foothold and that the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;may soon follow Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in losing the achievement of having eliminated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reevaluation is largely symbolic and hinges on whether a single measles chain has spread uninterrupted within the U.S. for at least 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists around the country are investigating whether the now-ended Texas outbreak is linked to active ones in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina. But doctors and scientists say the U.S. — and North America overall — has a measles problem, regardless of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really a question of semantics,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, a Wisconsin family physician who helped certify the U.S. was measles-free in 2000. “The bottom line is the conditions are sufficient to allow this many cases to occur. And that gets back to de-emphasizing a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the most since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and nearly 50 separate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem has been years in the making, as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;fewer kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get routine vaccines due to parental waivers, health care access issues and rampant disinformation. More recently, Trump administration health officials have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-safety-mmr-autism-rfk-hepatitis-20d3122d7a9a339cd8447a347bd49928"&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;sown doubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the established safety of vaccines at an unprecedented level while also &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;defunding local efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to improve vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing that we can do is to make sure the people who aren’t vaccinated get vaccinated,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center. “We have not issued a clear enough message about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said Thursday that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has consistently emphasized vaccines as the best way to prevent measles, adding that the CDC is responding to outbreaks and working to increase vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the department said it doesn’t have evidence that a single chain of measles has spread for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Measles finds the unv&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;accinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little room for error in trying to stop measles. The virus is one of the most contagious, infecting 9 out of every 10 unvaccinated people exposed. Community-level protection takes a 95% vaccination rate. The current rate nationally is 92.5%, according to CDC data, but many communities fall far below that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in Texas’ first known case developed the telltale rash on Jan. 20, 2025, according to state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the outbreak exploded. Officially, 762 people fell ill, most of them in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;rural Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and two children died. Many more got sick and were never diagnosed: 182 potential measles cases among children in Gaines County went unconfirmed in March 2025 alone, state health officials said, a possible undercount of 44% in that county.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Such data gaps are common, though, making it especially hard to track outbreaks. Many people living in communities where the virus is spreading face health care barriers and distrust the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing so many cases is also expensive, said behavioral scientist Noel Brewer, who chairs the U.S. committee that will finalize the data for international health officials. Research shows &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-health-departments-723baa2b92828b04092475f4763585a6"&gt;a single measles case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cost public health departments &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data on measles is still among the best worldwide, Brewer said, but “the U.S. has changed its investment in public health, so we’re less able to do the case tracking that we used to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic sequencing can fill some gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always enough to say the outbreaks are connected. Genetically, the measles virus doesn’t change as often as, say, flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within an outbreak, everybody is going to look the same,” said Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question may then be how PAHO experts will navigate final data gaps, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a Utah physician and longtime CDC consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“My best guess is we will lose elimination status,” Pavia said. “The case for this not being continuous transmission is tenuous, and I think they are likely to err on the side of declaring it a loss of elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have confirmed the same measles strain in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, Canada, Mexico and several other North American countries, said Sebastian Oliel, a spokesperson for the Pan American Health Organization, which will make the final decision on U.S. measles elimination at an April 13 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliel said when there is a case of unknown origin in a country with ongoing local spread, “the most conservative approach is to consider the case part of the existing national transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Mexico also up for review&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO will review Mexico’s measles-free status alongside the U.S., Oliel said. That country’s largest outbreak has roots in Texas. It started when an 8-year-old boy from Chihuahua state got sick after visiting family in Seminole, Texas. Since last February, 6,000 people have gotten sick in Mexico, and 21 have died in Chihuahua state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under PAHO’s definition of elimination, borders matter. If, for example, the chain of measles that started in the U.S. spread to Mexico and then returned to the U.S. anew, it would be considered a new chain, experts said. Still, many experts call that standard outdated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that measles found ample fertile ground in the U.S. in 2025, infiltrating &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-school-attendance-absences-0384199ace95b4088f60864ce9ec8315"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and day cares, churches, hospital waiting rooms and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-new-mexico-detention-facility-migrants-outbreak-c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea"&gt;a detention center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. New Mexico logged 100 cases and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299"&gt;one adult died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Kansas officials spent seven months trying to control an outbreak that sickened nearly 90 people across 10 counties. Ohio confirmed 40 cases. Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin each had 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than 800 people have gotten sick across Utah, Arizona and South Carolina since late summer, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;with no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2025 was the year of measles,” Brewer said. “Will 2026 be the year of rising or falling measles cases? Does it get worse or does it get better? No one knows the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

across 27 U.S. states, including California, according to federal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus — called &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; — is considered an “&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25152-candida-auris"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emerging infectious disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” as health care providers have seen an increase in cases since 2019, Cleveland Clinic experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 20, California had reported 1, 524 cases of the fungal infection in 2025, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/251634"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt;

of 34%, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How do people get deadly fungal infection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. auris usually affects patients with severe underlying medical conditions and people with invasive medical devices such as breathing tubes, feeding tubes and catheters, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection spreads through surfaces and objects and can live on a patient’s skin or body sites even if they don’t have symptoms, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="12" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and visitors aren’t at risk of becoming infected, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What are symptoms of Candida auris?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While symptoms of &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called ticking biological clock has been framed largely as a concern for women. We talk about egg freezing, ovarian reserve, and the ticking timeline of maternal fertility. Meanwhile, the male timeline has often been treated as a flat line — men, the story goes, can father children well into their twilight years with little consequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is it that simple, though? For one, we know that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10909733/"&gt;children of older fathers face higher statistical risks&lt;/a&gt; for neurodevelopmental disorders, stillbirth, and metabolic issues. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the British Andrology Society, and the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society have advised that the upper limit for sperm donors for assisted conception should be 40 years old as a precautionary measure, “so that the potential hazards related to aging are diminished” on the basis of increased risk of genetic abnormalities in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mechanism, however, has remained a black box. Is it just about accumulating DNA mutations and epigenetics, or is there something else hitching a ride into the egg?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;suggests the answer lies in a hidden world of genetic instructions that science has largely missed. By peeling back the layers of sperm biology, researchers have discovered a molecular “aging cliff” — a dramatic, sudden shift in the RNA profile of sperm that occurs in mid-life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like finding a molecular clock that ticks with age in both mice and humans, suggesting a fundamental, conserved molecular signature of sperm aging,” says Qi Chen, MD, PhD, associate professor of urology and human genetics at U of U Health and one of the senior authors of the research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, though by no means definitive, represent a fundamental rethinking of what fathers pass down to their children, and how the aging process rewrites the code of life before conception even happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decoding-sperm-degradation"&gt;Decoding Sperm Degradation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand this discovery, you have to understand why we missed it for so long. For years, scientists focused on the DNA package inside the sperm head. We knew that, as men age, this DNA could become fragmented. But sperm also carry RNA, a molecule usually tasked with carrying out DNA’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem was that standard sequencing tools couldn’t see the whole picture. Sperm RNAs are often heavily modified chemically, which makes them invisible to traditional sequencing machines, almost like writing a message in invisible ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;

            &lt;div class="zme-signup-container" id="zme-main-container"&gt;
                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Thank you! One more thing...&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;To solve this, Chen’s team utilized a technique they developed called PANDORA-seq. This method treats the RNA with enzymes that remove those chemical disguises, allowing the sequencer to read previously “unsequencable” molecules. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was a massive, previously hidden population of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), specifically those derived from transfer RNA (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA (rsRNAs)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These aren’t junk; they are regulatory elements that can control gene expression in the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied this “night vision” goggles approach to mouse sperm, the results were startling. They didn’t see a slow, linear decline. Instead, they saw a precipitous drop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 50 and 70 weeks of age in mice — roughly equivalent to mid-life in humans — the sperm RNA profile underwent a radical transformation. The researchers call it an “aging cliff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maybe this progressive length shift accumulates quietly, until it triggers the ‘cliff’ change at mid-life,” Chen suggests&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-paradox-of-length"&gt;The Paradox of Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most surprising aspect of this new data contradicts almost everything we thought we knew about aging and cellular decay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, when biological molecules age, they break down. DNA fragments, proteins degrade, and so on. You would expect the RNA in older sperm to be shorter, chopped up by the wear and tear of time. But the molecular clock in sperm runs backward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as the mice aged, specific ribosomal RNAs (rsRNAs) in the sperm head actually became &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt;. The ratio shifted: the abundance of longer RNA fragments increased, while the shorter ones decreased. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At first glance, this finding seems counterintuitive,” Chen says. “For decades, we have known that as sperm age, their DNA becomes more fragmented and broken. One might expect RNA to follow this pattern. Instead, we found the opposite: specific sperm RNAs actually become longer with age”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? The study suggests that the machinery responsible for chopping these RNAs into precise, functional sizes might be getting “rusty.” The enzymes that process these molecules may lose efficiency due to oxidative stress, leaving the RNAs unprocessed and overly long.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a quirk of mouse biology. The team validated these findings in two human cohorts. They looked at sperm samples from the same donors collected years apart and found the exact same phenomenon: the rsRNAs in the sperm heads of older men were consistently longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Validating this finding from mice to humans was really exciting,” says Kenneth Aston, PhD, director of the Andrology &amp;amp; IVF Lab at the University of Utah and co-senior author on the paper. “Our sperm bank resources at the University of Utah made this cross-species validation possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-signal-in-the-noise"&gt;The Signal in the Noise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One reason this “aging cliff” remained elusive for so long is that sperm are complex structures. They have a head, which contains the genetic payload, and a long tail packed with mitochondria to power their swim to the egg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers sequenced whole sperm in the past, the RNA from the tail drowned out the signal from the head. Yet by physically separating the sperm heads and sequencing them in isolation, the team clarified the signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This rsRNA length shift was a unique signal, specific to the sperm heads. It was obscured by the ‘noisier’ profile of the whole sperm,” explains co-corresponding author Tong Zhou, PhD, associate professor of physiology and cell biology in the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. “Sequencing the sperm head sample is what made this discovery possible”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction is crucial because it is the sperm head that fuses with the egg and delivers the genetic material. The finding that these shifted RNAs are locked inside the nucleus suggests they are poised to influence the embryo immediately after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even though the sperm heads were stripped of their tails (and thus their main power plants), the researchers still found traces of mitochondrial RNA inside the head. These mitochondrial RNAs mirrored the aging patterns of the genomic RNAs, suggesting a coordinated system where the sperm nucleus and mitochondria communicate about the aging state of the cell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hacking-the-embryo"&gt;Hacking the Embryo&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question, of course, is: “So what?” Does it matter if a father’s sperm carries slightly longer bits of RNA?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers created a synthetic “cocktail” of RNAs that mimicked the profile of an older father — high in long rsRNAs, low in short ones. They injected this “old RNA” cocktail into mouse embryonic stem cells, which serve as a model for the early embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results provided a potential mechanism for the health issues seen in children of older fathers. The “old” RNA cocktail reprogrammed the stem cells. It triggered significant changes in gene expression, specifically ramping up pathways involved in metabolism and turning on genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies show that advanced paternal age is l&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443922000187"&gt;inked to metabolic disorders and behavioral anomalies&lt;/a&gt; in offspring. This study provides a molecular smoking gun: the “old” sperm RNA alone was enough to induce these changes in cellular programming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This discovery, made possible by PANDORA-seq, could lay the groundwork for future diagnostics to help guide informed reproductive decisions and improve fertility outcomes,” says James M. Hotaling, MD, Chief Innovation Officer at University of Utah Health and an author on the study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fertility testing for men is fairly rudimentary relative to the requirements mandated by the new findings. Clinics count sperm, check if they are swimming, and look at their shape. But at the moment, they rarely look under the hood at the molecular instructions they carry. This research suggests that in the future, men might screen their “sperm RNA age” to understand the risks they might pass on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is now hunting for the specific enzymes that control this RNA processing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can understand the enzymes driving this shift, they could become actionable targets for interventions to potentially improve sperm quality in aging males,” Chen says. “Stay tuned”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s plan to blame autism on women using acetaminophen (a.k.a. Tylenol) during pregnancy is getting more pushback from actual scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past weekend, researchers in Europe published a review of the scientific evidence on autism and acetaminophen. After accounting for known biases in past studies, they failed to find a connection between maternal acetaminophen use and a greater risk of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions in children. The findings indicate that women can continue to safely take the over-the-counter pain and fever medication as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Current evidence does not indicate a clinically important increase in the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or intellectual disability in children of pregnant individuals who use paracetamol as directed, supporting existing recommendations on its safety,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynecology, &amp;amp; Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No causative link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last September, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a supposed breakthrough: they found evidence of a potential link between autism and acetaminophen during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though RFK Jr. and other White House officials were somewhat more cautious in their tone, noting that further research would be needed to confirm a causative relationship, Trump was not. At the press conference announcing the findings, he repeatedly told women to immediately stop using acetaminophen. Despite the lack of a smoking gun, the administration also stated it would take regulatory action, such as adding a warning label to acetaminophen products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time, however, rebuffed the administration’s claims. While some studies have suggested a possible link, many others haven’t, including studies explicitly designed to address limitations of observational research. Following Trump’s announcement, the UK and many other countries have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000663086"&gt;continued to endorse&lt;/a&gt; the use of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol in much of the world) during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is the only widely recommended painkiller for pregnant women, since other drugs can have serious side effects, including a &lt;a href="https://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/September2022/Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory%20drugs-NSAIDs-avoid-use%20in-pregnancy.html#:~:text=NSAID%20use%20in%20early%20pregnancy,some%20cases%2C%20neonatal%20renal%20impairment."&gt;higher risk of miscarriages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and elsewhere analyzed data from 43 high-quality studies. Some of these studies compared the outcomes of siblings born to the same mother who reported using acetaminophen during one pregnancy but not the other. Since siblings share many genetic and environmental factors in common, these studies can better account for potential noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, when the researchers included sibling studies in their analysis, they found no significant link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and a greater risk of children developing autism, intellectual disability, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also failed to find a link when they only included studies judged to be at low risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself,” said study author Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at City St George’s, University of London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2026/january2/taking-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-does-not-increase-risk-of-autism-adhd-or-intellectual-disabilities"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings echo those of a similar review &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/science-keeps-dismantling-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000683647"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last November, which also failed to find convincing evidence of a causative link between acetaminophen and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The major takeaway&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though no drug should be used more than needed, the authors are unequivocal about the implications of their research: Pregnant women shouldn’t be overly stressed about using acetaminophen/paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The message is clear—paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,” Khalil said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that this study, or any other independent research, will deter the Trump administration from moving forward with its attempt to scapegoat Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-makes-bizarre-connection-between-circumcision-tylenol-and-autism-2000670971"&gt;White House Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; discussing the report in early October, RFK Jr. acknowledged that the government did not have proof that acetaminophen can cause autism. Immediately after, however, he stated, “We’re doing the studies to make the proof.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s gnasty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scourge of mosquitoes has been terrorizing residents of El Segundo for the past two months — and the situation is only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say they are covered in bites and welts despite trying to eliminate the infestation, &lt;a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/el-segundo-mosquito-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fox 11 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many describe the infestation as overwhelming, saying mosquitoes have overrun yards and made their way inside homes, disrupting sleep and daily routines. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Residents in El Segundo say they have been locked in a relentless fight against mosquitoes for nearly two months, swatting and spraying at all hours of the day and night, with little sign of improvement. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;FOX 11 LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Locals have been swatting and spraying for months, sometimes for hours at a time. But the mosquitoes continue to overrun their yards and homes, and are making it hard to carry out daily routines or even sleep at night, they said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sounds are constant,” resident Truman Hedding told Fox 11, referring to the repeated zap of electric mosquito swatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get them, it’s the best, most satisfying thing in the world — but it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents say the mosquito surge began nearly two months ago and has only intensified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are covered in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/health/ivermectin-could-be-the-key-to-curbing-malaria/"&gt;mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt; every night,” Samantha Hedding told Fox 11. “My kids have welts. We’re late to school because we’re up until 4 or 5 in the morning killing mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;She said the insects are getting inside homes despite residents taking extreme precautions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are in our house. Every door is locked, every window is sealed,” Hedding said. “If a door opens, we all freak out. The weather has been beautiful, but we can’t enjoy it. We can’t open our windows or doors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city said it has been working to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

Get tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what’s making you sick is the first step to getting better. If you have symptoms of a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-polymicrobial-respiratory-infection-that-pope-francis-is-battling-101739876996097.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="respiratory infection"&gt;respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt;, talk to your doctor and consider a quick test.

Monitor your condition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on your symptoms and their intensity. If your fever is rising or any symptoms are worsening, consult your doctor immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3.

Take care of yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get plenty of rest and sleep. Take it easy, stay well hydrated (such as with water, broths, coconut water, or fresh juice), and eat healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;5. Stay home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you are experiencing symptoms of illness, you should isolate yourself so you can take time to recuperate, while also ensuring the infection is not spread further to other people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;“With winter in full swing, it’s important to stay ahead and protect your health. If you’re feeling well, keep up simple preventive habits, like washing hands, wearing a mask in crowded places, and maintaining distance. Vaccines for flu and pneumonia are one of the best ways to stay protected. By taking these steps, you can enjoy the season safely and keep your loved ones healthy,” concludes Dr Sonu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
