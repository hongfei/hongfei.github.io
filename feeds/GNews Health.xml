            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; predicts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and the world is not prepared. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000b3b6madevfu4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00692-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 2.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000c3b6mjhfcv2ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/climate/2024-hottest-year-record"&gt;to a warming climate&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000e3b6mxjc9n0a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000f3b6mpvok5bm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000g3b6mzcvtqmyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002i3b6mghcwbyjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/world/zombie-fungus-ophiocordyceps-the-last-of-us-scn"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002j3b6mds1obbu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that are killing millions in reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000k3b6mlr03crll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000l3b6mtpo31ztq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000m3b6m8qsvu0ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000n3b6mutejajyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000o3b6m8g0c2e0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w3psi00263b6m31fma28r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000q3b6m5oea2g0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0v4x2j001i3b6m87ll1lwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w56hf00283b6mrvayn1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.

            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000v3b6mpwmmxgiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3620763/" target="_blank"&gt;as the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The new Aspergillus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00113b6mkf33h6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wexbn002n3b6mivne2o96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00143b6m9j3smscr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”

Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer among men behind skin cancer, with about 1 in 8 men diagnosed during their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every man’s risk is different, depending on their lifestyle, race/ethnicity, family history, and age.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2024/02/10/prostate-cancer-diagnoses-rising-exponentially-american-men-symptoms-prevention/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; is more likely to develop in older men, the ACS says.

That’s because of a phytochemical called sulforaphane found in these veggies, which is known to help prevent numerous types of cancer in addition to prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva adds that tomatoes and watermelon have one compound that has been found to be particularly protective against prostate cancer: lycopene. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306521" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that lycopene can not only slow the progression and growth of prostate cancer cells, but it also could provoke the death of prostate cancer cells. However, Brockton cautions that research is still limited on lycopene, and a strong link has not been established yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva recommends eating at least five servings of whole fruits and vegetables daily to reap their cancer-protective effects—but the more you can eat, the better, she says. She advises keeping frozen fruits and vegetables—which are just as nutritious as fresh—stocked in your freezer to add into smoothies, oatmeal, or dinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill up on fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another nutrient that fruits and vegetables have in common that has protective qualities against cancer: &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber can help prevent cancer in numerous ways, experts say. Eating high-fiber foods—like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds—can boost your gut health, which in turn strengthens your immune system, according to Brockton. A stronger immune system will give your body the tools to fight off potentially cancerous cells, he told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503404/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; also found that eating high-fiber whole grains was able to lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer via the production of the sex-hormone binding globulin, which helps regulate androgen levels that influence prostate cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that men consume about 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day, but Silva advises shooting for 35 grams. She recommends making easy swaps like brown rice for white rice or whole grain bread for white bread to boost your fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small changes like that can certainly help to move the needle,” Silva tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also reach for high-fiber foods like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, barley, quinoa, amaranth, bulgur, and millet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like kale, spinach, bok choy, and arugula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples and pears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popcorn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some research also indicates that foods rich in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/05/omega-3s-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; could also help slow the progression of prostate cancer.

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world suffer from chronic low back pain, often finding relief only through temporary solutions like painkillers or invasive surgeries. However, groundbreaking research from &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:McGill University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; offers new hope. Scientists have identified two promising drugs that tackle the underlying cause—senescent cells, also called "zombie cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Are Senescent Cells?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells accumulate naturally with age or due to stress-induced damage, such as DNA injury, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction. These cells refuse to die and instead release harmful substances known collectively as the &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/study-reveals-why-cells-more-180700939.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SASP factors include inflammatory proteins, enzymes, and reactive molecules, which damage healthy tissue and accelerate degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and notably, low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Representative images of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and CD11b immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of sparc−/− mice (delineated in a dashed line). (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way," explained Lisbet Haglund, senior author of the study and professor at McGill’s Department of Surgery. "By removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Targeting the Root of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their approach, the researchers conducted experiments using mice genetically engineered to develop symptoms similar to human &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gel-derived-from-cow-mucus-could-revolutionize-spinal-cord-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spinal degeneration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. These mice lack a gene called SPARC, causing early spinal deterioration, inflammation, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers administered two drugs to these mice: o-vanillin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved drug previously used in cancer treatments. Both drugs individually reduced pain, inflammation, and degeneration in spinal discs, but their combined use showed even more powerful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," Haglund remarked. This discovery highlights an exciting new possibility for effectively managing low back pain at its source, rather than simply addressing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do These Drugs Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs belong to a category known as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-new-drug-could-extend-human-life-span-by-30/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:senolytics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically target and eliminate senescent cells. RG-7112 works by inhibiting proteins involved in cell survival, making it easier for the body to clear away these harmful cells. On the other hand, o-vanillin, initially included almost by accident due to its known anti-inflammatory properties, surprisingly proved capable of removing senescent cells as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed improved quality in vertebral bones and significantly reduced expression of pain markers within the spinal cord. This comprehensive improvement underscores the drugs’ potential as transformative therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Treatment with senolytics resulted in increased IVD volume and improved bone quality. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why This Research Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low back pain remains the leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in substantial personal suffering and economic burden, exceeding $100 billion annually in the United States alone. Treatments addressing root causes rather than symptoms could dramatically shift how chronic pain conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is particularly promising because senescent cells not only worsen degeneration by releasing harmful substances but also trigger &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/researchers-develop-urine-test-early-160700895.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring healthy cells, creating a damaging cascade. Eliminating these cells early could interrupt this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of specific markers related to senescence, like the protein p16Ink4a, reduced cell accumulation and spinal degeneration. This evidence reinforces the strategy of using senolytics like RG-7112 and o-vanillin to prevent or even reverse damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Senolytics removed SnCs and improved IVD health. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future Prospects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, further studies are necessary to confirm these drugs’ effectiveness and safety in humans. Haglund and her team aim to modify o-vanillin chemically, making it more stable and effective over longer periods in the body. The potential applications extend beyond back pain, possibly benefiting patients suffering from arthritis, osteoporosis, and other age-related diseases driven by senescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans," Haglund said. If successful, this research could pave the way for a new class of treatments that improve quality of life by directly targeting cellular aging and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive Study Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Advances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; and authored by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif, Lisbet Haglund, and colleagues, provides detailed scientific evidence supporting the use of senolytic drugs for treating chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;IVDs (L3-S1) from sparc−/− mice treated with senolytics or vehicle were isolated, and the release of 15 SASP factors was evaluated. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the preclinical trial, mice showed reduced pain behaviors, improved spinal health, and diminished inflammatory markers after eight weeks of treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is often seen as an unavoidable part of getting older. But new research suggests that it may not be as permanent as we once believed. A team of scientists from Brazil has identified a molecule in the brain that appears to reverse brain aging and could even cancel out the effects of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecule is called hevin, and it is secreted by a type of brain cell known as an astrocyte. These star-shaped cells help maintain the connections between neurons. As we age, these connections tend to weaken, which contributes to memory loss and slower thinking. Hevin plays a key role in keeping these connections strong.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.14493"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that older mice, along with mice that showed signs of Alzheimer’s, had reduced levels of hevin in their brains. When scientists increased hevin production in these animals, their cognitive abilities improved. The mice performed better on memory tasks, and their brain activity indicated healthier synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="brain MRI" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-6000995" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82 2400w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;The X-ray of the human brain close-up image Image source: merydolla / Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, boosting hevin did not affect the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques. These plaques are commonly linked to Alzheimer’s, but their role in causing the disease is still debated. This new research suggests that there may be other ways to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/new-study-suggests-alzheimers-may-be-reversible/"&gt;target cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; without focusing solely on removing plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

Much of the focus in neuroscience has traditionally been on neurons alone. By highlighting the role of these helper cells, the research opens up new directions for understanding how to reverse brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings are still early and based on animal studies, they offer hope for future treatments. Scientists believe that medications mimicking the effects of hevin could eventually help people &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/cognitive-decline-de-age-the-brain-stanford-study/"&gt;maintain or regain cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the study adds to our growing understanding of how the brain changes with age and &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/disabling-internet-on-your-smartphone-may-actually-reverse-brain-aging/"&gt;how those changes might be slowed or even reversed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, groundbreaking research from &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; offers new hope. Scientists have identified two promising drugs that tackle the underlying cause—senescent cells, also called "zombie cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="what_are_senescent_cells_"&gt;What Are Senescent Cells?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells accumulate naturally with age or due to stress-induced damage, such as DNA injury, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction. These cells refuse to die and instead release harmful substances known collectively as the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-some-cells-are-more-susceptible-to-cancer-than-others/"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SASP factors include inflammatory proteins, enzymes, and reactive molecules, which damage healthy tissue and accelerate degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and notably, low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Representative images of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and CD11b immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of sparc−/− mice (delineated in a dashed line).

"By removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="targeting_the_root_of_pain"&gt;Targeting the Root of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their approach, the researchers conducted experiments using mice genetically engineered to develop symptoms similar to human &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gel-derived-from-cow-mucus-could-revolutionize-spinal-cord-treatment/"&gt;spinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. These mice lack a gene called SPARC, causing early spinal deterioration, inflammation, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers administered two drugs to these mice: o-vanillin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved drug previously used in cancer treatments. Both drugs individually reduced pain, inflammation, and degeneration in spinal discs, but their combined use showed even more powerful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," Haglund remarked. This discovery highlights an exciting new possibility for effectively managing low back pain at its source, rather than simply addressing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_do_these_drugs_work_"&gt;How Do These Drugs Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs belong to a category known as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-new-drug-could-extend-human-life-span-by-30/"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically target and eliminate senescent cells. RG-7112 works by inhibiting proteins involved in cell survival, making it easier for the body to clear away these harmful cells. On the other hand, o-vanillin, initially included almost by accident due to its known anti-inflammatory properties, surprisingly proved capable of removing senescent cells as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed improved quality in vertebral bones and significantly reduced expression of pain markers within the spinal cord. This comprehensive improvement underscores the drugs’ potential as transformative therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Treatment with senolytics resulted in increased IVD volume and improved bone quality.

Treatments addressing root causes rather than symptoms could dramatically shift how chronic pain conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is particularly promising because senescent cells not only worsen degeneration by releasing harmful substances but also trigger &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-develop-urine-test-for-early-detection-of-lung-cancer/"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring healthy cells, creating a damaging cascade. Eliminating these cells early could interrupt this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of specific markers related to senescence, like the protein p16Ink4a, reduced cell accumulation and spinal degeneration. This evidence reinforces the strategy of using senolytics like RG-7112 and o-vanillin to prevent or even reverse damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Senolytics removed SnCs and improved IVD health.

Haglund and her team aim to modify o-vanillin chemically, making it more stable and effective over longer periods in the body. The potential applications extend beyond back pain, possibly benefiting patients suffering from arthritis, osteoporosis, and other age-related diseases driven by senescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans," Haglund said. If successful, this research could pave the way for a new class of treatments that improve quality of life by directly targeting cellular aging and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="comprehensive_study_findings"&gt;Comprehensive Study Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; and authored by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif, Lisbet Haglund, and colleagues, provides detailed scientific evidence supporting the use of senolytic drugs for treating chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;IVDs (L3-S1) from sparc−/− mice treated with senolytics or vehicle were isolated, and the release of 15 SASP factors was evaluated.

      &lt;p&gt;“It is essential that individuals without immunity stay home and avoid contact with others for 21 days following exposure,” said Molly Howell, immunization director at North Dakota Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, most North Dakotans are vaccinated against measles, and the risk to the general public is low. People who were vaccinated as children and

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that can be fatal, particularly for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles spreads through the air and can remain in a room and on surfaces for up to two hours. The virus can sometimes travel between floors through ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms often include a fever, cough, runny nose or eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. There is no specific medical treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about measles, vaccination or local clinic availability, contact the Health and Human Services Immunization Unit at

                Our newsroom occasionally reports stories under a byline of "staff." Often, the "staff" byline is used when rewriting basic news briefs that originate from official sources, such as a city press release about a road closure, and which require little or no reporting. At times, this byline is used when a news story includes numerous authors or when the story is formed by aggregating previously reported news from various sources. If outside sources are used, it is noted within the story.

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The case came to light when two families independently contacted their fertility clinics after their children developed cancers that appeared to be linked to a rare genetic variant. The European Sperm Bank, which had supplied the sperm, confirmed that the variant in a gene called TP53 was present in some of the donor’s sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The rare variant was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008, would not have been detectable using standard screening techniques, and the donor is understood to be in good health. However, analysis by Kasper’s lab concluded that the mutation was likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kasper said: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Simultaneously, a number of genetics and paediatric departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested. The variant was found in 23 children, 10 of whom have been diagnosed with cancer, including cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children with the risk gene are advised to be monitored with regular whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, as adults, of the breast and ultrasound examination of the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The European Sperm Bank, which applies a worldwide limit of 75 families for each sperm donor, said more than 67 children had been conceived using the donor’s sperm, but that its policy was to not confirm exact numbers of children for a specific donor. It said all of the relevant clinics had been alerted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kasper said this remained a concern. “Is 67 the total? It’s a really good question that I’ve asked the sperm bank. They didn’t want to tell me the denominator of the births for this donor,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Nicky Hudson, of De Montfort University in Leicester, said the case highlighted the complexity of the challenges that could arise when human gametes were shipped between countries and used for large numbers of recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the very least we need better systems for tracking donor usage and of informing recipients of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, said: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNVWI4RktSNDktZjNOaXNhM2M5YS1LT0lzU0FnRGVXNjlILW5TTDVPR21RZ1VxUzBZNExCUHQ4a2QzTk9oNl9nMEFFbkR0dnNnNFYwOTlEMWY4U3p4eTVnYXRsMmJrLS16T0ZDRFR2dzNESUZneGMzWEJ0UFVmY0tmUFZNWHM4ZXhlR2ZueDI2YWw</guid></item><item><title>一种类型的乳房X光检查被证明对乳房密集的女性更好-西雅图时报 | One type of mammogram proves better for women with dense breasts - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;One type of mammogram proves better for women with dense breasts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2pjdDQzLURSRzNkcVhWOS1VLUhpZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 21:30:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA</guid></item><item><title>由认证培训师打造的最佳7天减肥步行计划- EatingWell | The Best 7-Day Walking Plan to Lose Visceral Fat, Created by Certified Trainers - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVkVZT2R0Qk1leDBmYXVIMHFYNllVTWVVZXdRbXR3OXJEOTBQdkhMelNjRV9XSkJuRDZEb2M1a3JWcDhMUHE0VktLSVlFRHgyUGtUTElzUGMzemdEWVB2aGFEWGEwZllVQWtwazlwUE1SZVhuNlpTOW5LRHpwQmZ3WDNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise, including walking, is a great way to reduce visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking helps burn more calories and uses your fat stores for energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with 15 minutes daily at your own pace and work your way up as you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having adipose (fat) tissue in the body is completely normal &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;needed for certain bodily functions, such as hormone production. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt;, mainly visceral fat, raises your risk for serious health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, one effective way to reduce this fat is through movement. And you don’t need a gym membership or equipment, all it takes is lacing up your shoes and heading out the door to go for a walk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we spoke to two certified personal trainers who helped us create the best 7-day walking plan to lose visceral fat. We also explain just how walking works to reduce visceral fat and answer one of your most burning questions: how much do I really need to walk to see an effect? Let’s dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-your-walking-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Your Walking Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one mistake to avoid when starting a new fitness routine, it's going too hard and too fast. To see results and make a new habit stick, consistency is key, and one of the best ways to stay consistent is by pacing yourself. Overdoing it in a single session can leave you sore, burn out or worse, injured. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A beginner-friendly walking plan designed to reduce visceral fat should focus on gradually increasing time and intensity to support consistency and motivation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eehealth.org/healthy-driven/fitness-centers/services/personal-training/trainers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Courtney Kuenn, M.S., CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For each walk, Kuenn recommends completing it at a brisk pace. She recommends once or twice a week, adding short bursts of 1 to 2 minutes of fast walking to help stimulate fat burning. To add variety and challenge, you can also include stair walking or light hills into your walks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And don’t skip light stretching and rest days too, they are just as important for recovery and injury prevention. “Each week, individuals can increase their total walking time by 5-10% or add more intervals to continue progressing toward their fat loss goals,” says Kuenn. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a 7-day walking plan to lose visceral fat: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday: &lt;/strong&gt;25-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday: &lt;/strong&gt;30-Minute Walk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walking-helps-you-lose-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walking Helps You Lose Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking is one of the most achievable forms of exercise, and the only real barrier is often our own motivation to get out the door. But the best part? You can walk almost anywhere (inside or outside), and at almost any time (though maybe not at 3 am, safety first!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
First, walking helps you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activities-that-burn-as-many-calories-30-minute-walk-11727184" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;burn calories&lt;/a&gt;, which creates a calorie deficit. Kuenn explains: “When you walk, your body burns energy, and over time, consistent walking increases your daily calorie expenditure enough to promote fat loss, even if your diet remains the same.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Second, your body uses your fat stores for energy to walk. “Moderate intensity exercise relies mostly on fat for fuel,” says &lt;a href="https://danawhitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC&lt;/a&gt;, a certified athletic trainer. She adds that walking is a great way to get cardiovascular exercise in the moderate-intensity zone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;And you don’t need to be speedy to see results. One study found that slow walking led to more significant fat loss in individuals with overweight than fast walking, likely because participants could stick with the activity longer at a slower pace.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Walking can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, helping your body use glucose more efficiently rather than storing it as fat, Kuenn explains. “This is important because poor insulin function can lead to increased fat accumulation in the abdominal area.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Yet, walking also helps reduce visceral fat by helping &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, your body’s stress hormone. “Elevated cortisol due to chronic stress is closely linked to visceral fat storage. Walking, especially in calming environments or as a mindfulness practice, can help lower cortisol levels,” says Kuenn. Research has shown that physical activity is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-when-you-wake-up-for-healthy-cortisol-levels-8784363" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;effective strategy for reducing cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and even helps you sleep better. Poor or insufficient sleep can also lead to more visceral fat storage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, one common question trainers often hear is: Can I &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spot train visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; away? White sets the record straight: “You can’t ‘spot train’ visceral fat with sit-ups and crunches, going for total body movement for calorie burn is how fat mass is truly lost.” Another win for walking!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-to-walk-to-reduce-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much to Walk to Reduce Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;White says you don’t need to walk for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; each day to see results. For beginners, the sweet spot to shoot is 30-60 minutes daily. But remember, this doesn’t have to be all in one stretch of time. Breaking up your daily goal of 30 minutes into 10-minute chunks can make it easier to hit. For example, try to do 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes during a mid-day break and your last 10 minutes in the evening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;And if the weather has other plans, you can still stay on track by walking on a treadmill, climbing a flight of stairs or simply taking a day to stretch. Slowly over time, you can work your way up to 150 to 300 minutes of walking per week, which aligns with public health recommendations, adds Ruenn. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pairing your walking plan with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy (non-restrictive) diet&lt;/a&gt; can help you achieve results in a more sustainable way. And it doesn't have to be a huge overhaul of your current diet. It's best to do it in a healthy, slow and progressive manner too. You might start by adding at least &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-you-should-start-to-lose-visceral-fat-11698263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;two veggies&lt;/a&gt; to lunch and another two to dinner. Or swap out a sugary soda or sweetened coffee drink for a no-sugar-added option. And add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-if-you-want-to-lose-visceral-fat-8785221" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;foods that can support visceral fat loss&lt;/a&gt; to your shopping cart the next time you hit the grocery store.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking is the perfect exercise to help reduce visceral fat. It can be done from almost anywhere and even at your own pace. When done consistently, walking can help reduce visceral fat by burning calories, using fat stores, improving insulin function, lowering cortisol levels, and even helping you sleep better. Certified personal trainers recommend aiming for 30-60 minutes of walking about five days a week. You can add an extra challenge by incorporating bursts of faster walking, hills or stairs. Pair your walking routine with a healthy diet, and you’ll feel your best!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen this in major media yet (except CBS), nor here, but this story is spreading on Facebook and in Europe today: (CBS) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-reports-cases-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-china/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;U.S. reports cases of new COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;'s airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see the CDC is still on the job (NO snark intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daily Express (US version) is also alarming: &lt;a href="https://www.the-express.com/news/health/172633/new-covid-19-variant-nb181-detected-china-us-airports" target="_blank" title=""&gt;New Covid variant lands in US after ripping through countries, killing some in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is yet to be evidence that this new variant is more severe, but authorities in Hong Kong say they have already begun urging locals to wear masks in crowded places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also reported a rise in emergency room visits, including severe cases and deaths, and the country's health authorities have said they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee unanimously recommended that the newest vaccines for Covid should be updated to target a variant of strains currently on the rise, including NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting on Thursday was the first the Administration has had since President Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (UK) Economic Times also has some details: &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-spreading-in-u-s-is-it-more-dangerous-do-vaccines-work-and-whats-the-fatality-rate/articleshow/121369143.cms" target="_blank" title=""&gt;COVID variant NB.1.8.1 spreading in U.S.: is it more dangerous, do vaccines work, and what's the fatality rate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers: It does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be more severe than previous variants, but it spreads more rapidly. Also, “Early data suggests that updated vaccines targeting related variants such as LP.8.1 may be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there is no sign that NB.1.8.1 causes more severe illness than previous strains. But what it lacks in evasiveness, it may make up for in speed. Early research from China suggests the variant binds more effectively to human cells, which could make it more contagious than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, during a routine exam last week my doctor suggested getting a COVID booster, which I did. Consult your doctor or other health care to consider doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., Rep. Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) and 22 of her House colleagues demanded the release of HIV funding allocated by Congress but withheld by the Trump administration. They cited estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, known as amfAR, that the cuts could lead to 143,000 additional HIV infections nationwide and 127,000 additional deaths from AIDS-related causes within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said the effects would be felt in communities small and large across the country but that California would be hit the hardest. She said L.A. County — which stands to lose nearly $20 million in annual federal HIV prevention funding — is being forced to terminate contracts with 39 providers and could see as many as 650 new cases per year as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to amfAR, that would mark a huge increase, pushing the total number of new infections per year in the county to roughly 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“South L.A. and communities across California are already feeling the devastating impacts of these withheld HIV prevention funds. These cuts aren’t just numbers — they’re shuttered clinics, canceled programs, and lives lost,” Friedman said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example, she said, the Los Angeles LGBT Center — which is headquartered in her district — would likely have to eliminate a range of services including HIV testing, STD screening, community education and assistance for patients using pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a medicine taken by pill or shot that can greatly reduce a person’s risk of becoming infected from sex or injection drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list reviewed by The Times of L.A. County providers facing funding cuts included large and small organizations and medical institutions in a diverse set of communities, from major hospitals and nonprofits to small clinics. The list was provided by a source on the condition of anonymity in order to be candid about the funding of organizations that have not all publicly announced the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected organizations serve a host of communities that already struggle with relatively high rates of HIV infection, including low-income, Spanish speaking, Black and brown and LGBTQ+ communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to L.A. County, the Trump administration’s budget blueprint eliminates or reduces a number of congressionally authorized public health programs, including funding cuts to the domestic HIV prevention program and the Ryan White program, which supports critical care and treatment services for uninsured and underinsured people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county said the cuts would have “an immediate and long-lasting impact” on community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of organizations and hospitals, such as Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, are bracing for the disruption and potential vacuum of preventative services they’ve been providing to the community since the 1980s, according to Claudia Borzutzky, the hospital’s Chief of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borzutzky said without the funding, programs that provide screening, education, patient navigation and community outreach — especially for at-risk adolescents and young adults — will evaporate. So, too, will free services that help patients enroll in insurance and access HIV prevention medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who “face a variety of health barriers” and are often stigmatized will bear the brunt, she said, losing the “role models [and] peer educators that they can relate to and help [them] build confidence to come into a doctor’s office and seek testing and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are having to sunset these programs really, really quickly, which impacts our patients and staff in really dramatic ways,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers to queries sent to other southern California health departments suggested they are trying to figure out how to cope with budget shortfalls, too. Health officials from Kern, San Bernardino and Riverside counties all said the situation is uncertain, and that they don’t yet know how they will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman and her colleagues — including fellow California representatives Nancy Pelosi, Judy Chu, Gilbert Cisneros Jr., Robert Garcia, Sam Liccardo, Kevin Mullin, Mark Takano, Derek Tran and George Whitesides — said they were concerned not only about funding for programs nationwide being cut, but also about the wholesale dismantling or defunding of important divisions working on HIV prevention within the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They questioned in their letter staffing cuts to the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as “the reported elimination” of the Division of HIV Prevention within that center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to demanding the release of funds already allocated by Congress, the representatives called on Kennedy — and Dr. Debra Houry, deputy director of the CDC — to better communicate the status of ongoing grant funding, and to release “a list of personnel within CDC who can provide timely responses” when those groups to whom Congress had already allocated funding have questions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Congress has appropriated funding for HIV prevention in Fiscal Year 2025, several grant recipients have failed to receive adequate communication from CDC regarding the status of their awards,” Friedman and her colleagues wrote. “This ambiguity has caused health departments across the country to pre-emptively terminate HIV and STD prevention contracts with local organizations due to an anticipated lack of funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter is just the latest challenge to the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts to federal agencies and to federal funding allocated by Congress to organizations around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a series of executive orders and with the help of his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” and other agency heads, Trump in the first months of his second term has radically altered the federal government’s footprint, laying off thousands of federal workers and attempting to claw back trillions of dollars in federal spending — to be reallocated to projects more aligned with his political agenda, or used to pay for tax cuts that Democrats and independent reviewers have said will disproportionately help wealthy Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta’s office has repeatedly sued the Trump administration over such moves, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-05/california-other-states-sue-to-block-trump-administration-cuts-to-health-department"&gt;including cuts and layoffs within Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; broadly and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-01/california-sues-over-cuts-to-cdc-infectious-disease-funding"&gt;cuts to grants intended to make states more resistant to infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; specifically — calling them unwise, legally unjustifiable and a threat to the health of average Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LGBTQ+ organizations also have sued the Trump administration over orders to preclude health and other organizations from spending federal funding on diversity, equity and inclusion programs geared toward LGBTQ+ populations, including programs designed to decrease new HIV infections and increase healthy management of the disease among transgender people and other vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The orders seek to erase transgender people from public life; dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives; and strip funding from nonprofits providing life-saving health care, housing, and support services,” said Jose Abrigo, the HIV Project Director of Lambda Legal, in a statement. The legal group has filed a number of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration cuts, including one on behalf of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and other nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has defended his cuts to the federal government as necessary to implement his agenda. He and his agency leaders have consistently said that the cuts target waste, fraud and abuse in the government, and that average Americans will be better served following the reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has consistently defended the changes within Health and Human Services, as well. Agency spokespeople have said the substantial cuts would help it focus on Kennedy’s priorities of “ending America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy has said. “This Department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has repeatedly spread misinformation about HIV and AIDS in the past, including by giving credence to the false claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as June 2023, Kennedy told a &lt;a class="link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank"&gt;reporter for New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt; that there “are much better candidates than H.I.V. for what causes AIDS,” and he has previously suggested that environmental toxins and “poppers” — an inhalant drug popular in the gay community — could be causes of AIDS instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of that is supported by science or medicine. Studies from around the world have proven the link between HIV and AIDS, and found it — not drug use or sexual behavior — to be the only common factor in AIDS cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in L.A. County said they remained hopeful that the Trump administration would reverse course after considering the effects of the cuts — and the “detrimental impacts on the health and well-being of residents and workers across” the county if they are allowed to stand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 20:47:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNSzZ1alBkbG8zVl9FejlDVG1PQzdqcFROczNBX2ZrRVJwa1UzbjEtNHhtZllZZEZwWWdrWDM2dDVZaC10YjdMU192aE53T3ozM2E4NzVqUmQxQ3dTaTh1YWpzU05Iek02NjI5V1FRbjNhN19Wb0Y3T2RYdmZtaFo3UENBdmV3ejJtRG1ITHI3LXRxenYzbU43X0FKajUxaVh1UThIVXEtc2E4WlAt</guid></item><item><title>科学家们终于证实了1958年关于维生素B1的“疯狂”假设- Earth.com | Scientists finally confirm the 'crazy' hypothesis about vitamin B1 from 1958 - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaEZzRllkUmU0cHV5T19YTEx6UXBIYlItdG9reUI0TnA4V2poaEdBQTBCaFQ2Ni1JUlo5ZkdOcG1maHY3cDlTTl92ak5qVzl4WTJtOFBNZFdaWXZ6Rk5zMm9JdzFtY1d3NTdRVlNxVVJQMHpGSTlSeFROcUZvdGtXMkRib0N3WFBGeGcxaVVQNlFjOUw3MmVjR0NlaEZoX1lYUWkwaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists once dismissed a 1958 hypothesis about vitamin B1, or thiamine, as unlikely. The idea was that this vitamin, vital for basic metabolic functions, might turn into a very reactive intermediate during certain biochemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have shown that the hunch was correct. &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/vincentl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof. Vincent Lavallo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Riverside (&lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;), led the investigation that confirms vitamin B1 can form a reactive species called a carbene, even in watery surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-vitamin-b1-and-carbenes"&gt;Understanding vitamin B1 and carbenes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00001a054"&gt;Carbenes&lt;/a&gt; have only six valence electrons on the carbon atom. They are known for being so reactive that they often vanish moments after forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water, which normally disrupts these molecules almost instantly, was never thought to be a friendly environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water. People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right,” said Lavallo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiamine is key to &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b16594/introduction-nutrition-metabolism-david-bender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fundamental tasks&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including the breakdown of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bumblebees-choose-immediate-rewards-over-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugars for energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-so-much-doubt-for-so-long"&gt;Why so much doubt for so long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes were long considered too unstable for water because of how quickly they react. Even trace moisture in the air could destroy them before scientists had a chance to study them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most early attempts to observe carbenes in water ended in failure. They either disappeared or broke apart into other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing the belief that they simply couldn’t last in water-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That skepticism ran deep. Researchers preferred to work with these molecules in dry, oxygen-free environments using special lab setups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made the idea of observing them in water, let alone storing them, sound like science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-fresh-approach-to-working-in-water"&gt;A fresh approach to working in water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carbene in water seemed &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400640e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;impossible&lt;/a&gt; because water usually attacks such electron-poor carbon centers right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were making these reactive molecules to explore their chemistry, not chasing a historical theory, but it turns out our work ended up confirming exactly what Breslow proposed all those years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Varun-Tej-Raviprolu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Varun Raviprolu&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues developed a special chemical covering – a molecular shield – to keep the carbene from making contact with water. This shield prevented immediate breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1958-theory-turned-out-to-be-true"&gt;1958 theory turned out to be true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemist &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01547a064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald Breslow&lt;/a&gt; suggested ages ago that thiamine might transform into a carbene during certain body reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one could prove it. The new findings show that under the right conditions, the carbene form of vitamin b1 is stable enough to observe with advanced tools like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-trace-forever-chemicals-back-to-their-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say this stability helps explain how crucial transformations occur in living cells. Their protective strategy shows that the body could be forming short-lived carbene intermediates during routine metabolic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eco-friendly-b1-manufacturing"&gt;Eco-friendly B1 manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carbenes can serve as ligands in metal-based catalysts, which are widely used to produce many substances. Carbenes in water may open a path to cleaner processes, thanks to reduced dependence on harmful solvents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water is the ideal solvent – it’s abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly. If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a big step toward greener chemistry,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These catalysts could transform how pharmaceuticals and everyday materials are produced. Some industry reactions are notorious for generating chemical waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing water-based techniques, the hope is to cut costs and avoid safety concerns linked to flammable liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mimicking-life-s-chemistry-in-the-lab"&gt;Mimicking life’s chemistry in the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living cells rely on complex, water-based reactions to keep the body running. Many of those reactions involve fast, reactive intermediates that are hard to detect or replicate in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Lavallo’s team managed to stabilize a molecule that mimics this behavior could help researchers recreate cellular chemistry more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a better grasp of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cruelty-free-foie-gras-made-with-enzymes-not-force-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how enzymes work&lt;/a&gt; and possibly new ways to repair or reprogram those functions in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes are often studied for their ability to mimic parts of enzyme action. Now that scientists can make them behave in watery environments, they might start finding ways to control them for specific biological tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could eventually change how we design &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spider-venom-has-hidden-biochemical-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enzyme-inspired&lt;/a&gt; drugs or materials that react only under the same conditions found inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-with-vitamin-b1"&gt;Next steps with vitamin B1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proving that carbene intermediates can survive in water solves a riddle about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tomatoes-could-become-an-important-source-of-vitamin-d/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; b1’s potential. It also raises new questions about other fleeting molecules that may exist in living systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavallo and his team hope that a similar method might reveal more hidden players involved in major biological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that seems impossible today might be possible tomorrow, if we continue to invest in science,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding suggests that nobody should dismiss theories, no matter how far-fetched, without thorough research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr9681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 20:45:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaEZzRllkUmU0cHV5T19YTEx6UXBIYlItdG9reUI0TnA4V2poaEdBQTBCaFQ2Ni1JUlo5ZkdOcG1maHY3cDlTTl92ak5qVzl4WTJtOFBNZFdaWXZ6Rk5zMm9JdzFtY1d3NTdRVlNxVVJQMHpGSTlSeFROcUZvdGtXMkRib0N3WFBGeGcxaVVQNlFjOUw3MmVjR0NlaEZoX1lYUWkwaQ</guid></item><item><title>平衡的肠道细菌可以提高免疫力和减缓衰老- Earth.com | Balanced gut bacteria can boost immunity and slow aging - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOQXhxYnIxZUR6Q3FEX2ZMWG1qS1piOHgteFhuamlMYkhQdzRfV01WNnRNNVk0NzlZU3JuUlJQRDV6emZYUmZMTE1yblFuT2NaUVBXTmhKU2dUMVE4R2NYV0t6Q0VMYVZjLTNkZVpkbEVZNUEyU0NGTUhLaUEzcW5WSWNrN24ta05kekxN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science has long know that the trillions of bacteria in the gut help digest food and ward off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review now shows the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-have-very-clever-ways-of-supporting-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; does far more: it orchestrates immune balance throughout the body, helps keep our DNA in good repair, and may act as a brake – or an accelerator – on the aging process itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-balance-vs-imbalance"&gt;Gut balance vs. imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In eubiosis, a balanced gut microbiome keeps the intestinal lining tight, blocks harmful invaders, and prevents &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reprogramming-the-immune-system-to-attack-cancer-cells/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when that balance is lost – because of antibiotics, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-protein-packed-diets-are-really-doing-to-your-gut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;poor diet&lt;/a&gt;, chronic stress, or illness – the intestinal barrier becomes “leaky.” This dysbiosis allows bacterial fragments and toxins to enter the bloodstream, triggering immune alarms far from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptors on immune cells detect those microbial signals. If they fire too often, the body shifts into a simmering inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review describes how that cascade reaches the lungs via the gut–lung axis. It also affects the brain via nerves, hormones, and SCFAs – anti-inflammatory molecules made when gut bacteria digest dietary fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case studies link an unhealthy microbiome to worse outcomes in COVID-19, asthma, autoimmune diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-health-may-be-the-key-to-anxiety-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and zoonotic infections. The message is clear: what happens in the gut seldom stays in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microbes-help-or-harm-dna"&gt;Microbes help or harm DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut residents also manufacture chemicals that contact the cells lining the colon. Some compounds, such as the SCFAs butyrate and propionate, promote accurate DNA repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others do the opposite. Certain strains of E&lt;em&gt;scherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; produce toxins – colibactin, typhoid toxin, and cytolethal distending toxin – that slice through DNA’s double helix or sabotage the p53 protein, a key tumor suppressor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated hits can seed mutations and foster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-plant-has-great-potential-to-fight-colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Epigenetic changes, in which chemical tags are added to DNA or histone proteins, further tilt the balance either toward stability or genomic chaos, depending on which microbes dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-meets-microbial-imbalance"&gt;Aging meets microbial imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, the immune system naturally loses vigor – a process known as immunosenescence. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue shrinks, the supply of naïve T cells that respond to new infections dwindles; dendritic cells and regulatory T cells lose finesse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dysbiosis is present, these losses accelerate. Helpful dendritic cells flip into a pro-inflammatory mode, and the resulting chronic inflammation – popularly called “inflammaging” – feeds back to damage the microbiome, forming a vicious circle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCFAs again show their value: adequate levels tighten the gut barrier, calm overactive immune cells, and keep inflammation in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leaky-gut-leaky-brain"&gt;Leaky gut, leaky brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barrier breakdown is not just an intestinal problem. Heightened permeability allows microbial products and inflammatory molecules to reach the liver, joints, blood vessels, and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research reviewed in the article links depleted SCFAs and elevated endotoxins to the neuroinflammation seen in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/targeting-the-gut-might-be-key-in-preventing-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and other neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s immune cells, called microglia, respond to gut-derived signals by releasing cytokines. This damages neurons and accelerates cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-damage-and-inflammation"&gt;DNA damage and inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation generates reactive oxygen species – damaging molecules that nick DNA and hamper repair enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA damage, in turn, activates cellular alarm systems such as NF-κB, which pump out more inflammatory cytokines. The review calls this reciprocal relationship a “DNA-damage–inflammation loop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking that loop might slow both cancer development and functional decline with age. SCFAs once more appear helpful: they loosen tight chromatin, allowing repair machinery access to broken strands, and they influence DNA methylation patterns that govern gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microbiome-gaps-remain"&gt;Microbiome gaps remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite many associations, the authors note most studies are snapshots, making it difficult to prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbiomes vary widely among individuals, shaped by genetics, diet, geography, and lifestyle. That diversity complicates the search for universal “good” or “bad” bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging instead is the idea of functional signatures – chemical outputs like high butyrate or low &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toxin-from-toilet-paper-production-found-in-killer-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;toxin&lt;/a&gt; levels that indicate a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-omics tools now allow researchers to catalog bacterial genes (metagenomics), the molecules they release (metabolomics), and the host’s own responses (transcriptomics and epigenomics) in the same samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining these layers promises to reveal markers that flag dangerous dysbiosis early and guide personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-targeted-gut-treatments-ahead"&gt;Targeted gut treatments ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future treatments may involve designer probiotics that crank up SCFA output, fiber-rich diets tailored to an individual’s microbial gaps, or small-molecule drugs that block microbial toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fecal microbiota transplantation – still experimental – has already shown success against recurrent &lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt; infections and may one day be refined for cancer prevention or healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-gut-balance-matters"&gt;Why gut balance matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review portrays the gut microbiome as a central hub linking immunity, DNA integrity, and the pace of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thriving microbial community helps maintain a strong barrier, trains the immune system to react appropriately, and keeps genetic caretakers on duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disturb that community, and the consequences ripple outward. Chronic inflammation rises, DNA repairs falter, and age-related diseases gain momentum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because every degree of microbial balance matters, the authors conclude, preserving or restoring that balance should join exercise, diet, and sleep as pillars of a long and healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2024-00046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 19:10:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOQXhxYnIxZUR6Q3FEX2ZMWG1qS1piOHgteFhuamlMYkhQdzRfV01WNnRNNVk0NzlZU3JuUlJQRDV6emZYUmZMTE1yblFuT2NaUVBXTmhKU2dUMVE4R2NYV0t6Q0VMYVZjLTNkZVpkbEVZNUEyU0NGTUhLaUEzcW5WSWNrN24ta05kekxN</guid></item><item><title>一名患有麻疹的国际旅行者在传染期间访问了爱达荷州的多个地点- KTVB | An international traveler with measles visited multiple Idaho locations during infectious period - KTVB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAJBVV95cUxQZlk4eS1oX2JOVnBMT3JHZkJtYmNXWTdrMXY3TGNFcEVybmhsNnRoYmMwREoxNVp3eTVtaklhanR6S3pmZEFnUGx0QnhuMzdOS3hWNnlMdW5lS0oxY2pEMzU3TDR4MVZYcWl2aXdhRXVjd1hKbW1Eall4c2w1ellSeFNXUS1jWndQdFZOWVh2VGdCMjdWS3l4bUM2Z1gzWEVyY0RBYWJ3R3BPRU9oa2VQd0QxaDhBRThicmprcko5MF8zVGhheXpRZy00c0NaemRRS2ttQVEwUndyMm5mcWRacFAwSFZNdXhURzdqaEI0czRrZFJJSEFHNDAxbGlwZGJ3eUNXYlZNVW1uMVZlZ3FYXzJOZ0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The visitor spent time at Burley establishments during their infectious period.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURLEY, Idaho — Health officials are investigating a measles case involving an international business traveler who visited several locations in south-central Idaho while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their infectious period, the out-of-state visitor spent time at three Burley establishments: EdgeWater Dining and Spirits on Monday evening, an urgent care clinic on Tuesday morning and Intermountain Health Cassia Regional Hospital on Tuesday morning and afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the South Central Public Health District, anyone exposed to measles at these locations could develop symptoms between Saturday and June 14. Officials are notifying identified contacts, though some brief exposures may not have been captured in the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveler visited EdgeWater Dining and Spirits at 530 Hampton Drive between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Monday. On Tuesday, they went to Urgent Care of Idaho's Burley Clinic at 382 Overland Ave. between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., then to Cassia Regional Hospital at 1501 Hiland Ave. between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urgent care clinic shares a waiting room with two other businesses, potentially expanding exposure risk. The hotel where the individual stayed has notified guests who were present during the relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings indicate the infected person received a childhood measles vaccination. While breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals are rare, emerging data suggest these cases tend to be less severe and less infectious than infections in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are focused on working with state and local health organizations in this ongoing investigation," said Tanis Maxwell, the health district's family and children's health director. "Our priority is to keep the public informed and to support anyone who may have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves. Patients remain contagious from four days before until four days after the characteristic rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough and rash. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, people who may have been exposed should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider. Those experiencing measles symptoms should call ahead before visiting medical facilities to allow staff to prepare isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, with one dose providing about 93% protection and two doses offering 97% effectiveness. Health officials encourage residents to verify their MMR vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

You’re sniffling. And it really feels like your springtime allergies are just so much worse this year. You’re not alone in feeling that way — nor is it all in your head. There are good reasons why allergies are hitting people harder this year, and experts say it has to do with the larger amount of pollen that’s in the air because of&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/climate-change-allergies-new-175334734.html" data-ylk="slk:climate change;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a condition that occurs when your immune system overreacts to allergens like pollen, dust or pet dander, and it &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.aaaai.org/about/news/for-media/allergy-statistics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:affects between 10% to 30% of people worldwide;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;affects between 10% to 30% of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. In the spring, pollen is the biggest culprit of allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As temperatures warm, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/got-allergies-trees-grasses-plants-101538100.html" data-ylk="slk:trees like oaks, maples, bayberries and pines;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;trees like oaks, maples, bayberries and pines&lt;/a&gt;, as well as different types of grasses and other plants, begin to release large amounts of pollen. This burst can overwhelm immune systems that are sensitive to pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Allergy specialist &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://ronsaff.com/our-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ron Saff;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Ron Saff&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Florida State University College of Medicine, told Yahoo News to “think of these pollen grains as little cannonballs.” The wind then takes these pollen cannonballs into the nasal cavities, the sinuses and the eyes. When these little pollen cannonballs explode, they cause the cells to “release histamine and all kinds of inflammatory mediators.” That’s what causes the classic symptoms of allergies, such as sneezing and itchy, watery eyes and a runny nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It depends on where you live, and every part of the country has different allergenic trees,” Saff said. “So what's making patients miserable with allergies in north Florida isn’t necessarily the same thing that's causing people to suffer in places like New York.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But no matter what part of the country you live in, things are getting worse, Saff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients are suffering from more allergy symptoms, and that's a reflection of global warming with global climate change,” he said. “The trees are tricked into thinking it’s an earlier spring because the temperatures are warmer, and that causes the trees to pollinate earlier. They also pollinate longer into the pollination season. So we're seeing a slow, gradual increase in the amount of allergies across the United States and in many parts of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Horticulturist and author &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/167207/thomas-leo-ogren/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Ogren;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Thomas Ogren&lt;/a&gt; told Yahoo that “climate change is making the seasons longer,” meaning that certain plants that are allergenic, such as juniper trees, are blooming more than once a year. Others are staying in bloom for an extended period of time, making allergy season “five, six or seven weeks longer,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s another factor making allergies worse too, Ogren said. In urban areas, pollen interacts with pollutant particulate, making the pollen grain “explode into little, tiny particles.” And because they’re so small, they can “be inhaled very deeply” in the lungs, which can cause asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-can-we-do-to-mitigate-our-allergies"&gt;What can we do to mitigate our allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While we don’t have direct control over the pollination cycles of the nature around us, experts previously told Yahoo that there are ways to mitigate our exposure. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://allergyasthmanyc.com/dr-purvi.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Purvi Parikh;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Purvi Parikh&lt;/a&gt;, an allergist and immunologist with the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Allergy and Asthma Network;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Allergy and Asthma Network&lt;/a&gt;, said it’s important to avoid going outside during peak allergy time, like the early morning. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.taniaelliottmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Tania Elliott;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Tania Elliott&lt;/a&gt;, allergist, immunologist and chief medical officer at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mynectar.com/products/at-home-allergy-test?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;amp;utm_campaign=byeallergies79&amp;amp;cid=byeallergies79&amp;amp;tw_source=google&amp;amp;tw_adid=665186409501&amp;amp;tw_campaign=19941992609&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw3JanBhCPARIsAJpXTx6sCPQ3hd10TiO88awd637TemZU1rYMw5A1o8jiU3Fo5uM15SOxhtUaArhyEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nectar Allergy;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Nectar Allergy&lt;/a&gt;, noted that changing your clothes as soon as you come home from a day outside can also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Don't wear shoes in the house and, if possible, shower in the evenings to wash off any pollen that's gotten in your hair,” she explained.

Most people are right-handed, but left- and mixed-handed individuals comprise a significant minority. Handedness is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors, and emerges early in development, even prenatally. It is also associated with brain lateralization, especially in regions involved in language. Because some mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are also linked to altered brain asymmetry, researchers have suspected that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/meta-analysis-suggests-psychopathy-may-be-an-adaptation-rather-than-a-mental-disorder/"&gt;handedness might reflect&lt;/a&gt; underlying neurocognitive differences relevant to these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Packheiser and colleagues examined this possibility more systematically by conducting a second-order meta-analysis: essentially, a meta-analysis of meta-analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first identified 10 relevant meta-analyses that examined conditions such as ADHD, autism, depression, dyslexia, dyscalculia, intellectual disability, PTSD, pedophilia, stuttering, and schizophrenia. Each meta-analysis included studies comparing individuals diagnosed with a given condition to healthy control groups, and provided data on whether participants were right-handed, left-handed, or mixed-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team updated each of these existing meta-analyses by searching for and incorporating newly published studies, adding 33 additional datasets to the original 369, for a total of 402 datasets spanning over 202,000 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final dataset encompassed a broad range of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders, and included detailed information about participant age, sex ratio, handedness classification methods, and geographical location of studies. Data were extracted and reanalyzed using a consistent statistical pipeline. Only studies with both clinical and control groups, clear handedness reporting, and no handedness-based participant selection were included. Key moderator variables were also coded, such as whether the disorder was neurodevelopmental, whether it involved language-related symptoms, and the typical age of onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all studies, individuals with mental or neurodevelopmental conditions were more likely to show atypical hand preferences, meaning they were either left-handed or mixed-handed, than healthy controls. The overall odds ratio indicated that people with these conditions were about 1.5 times more likely to be non-right-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking specifically at left-handedness and mixed-handedness, both were significantly more common in clinical groups, with mixed-handedness showing the strongest association. However, these trends varied substantially depending on the disorder. Schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability showed the most pronounced associations with atypical handedness, while conditions like depression and dyscalculia showed no significant differences compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers explored potential moderating factors, several patterns emerged. Disorders that are classified as neurodevelopmental—such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, intellectual disability, and stuttering—showed significantly higher rates of non-right-handedness compared to non-neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, conditions associated with language difficulties were more strongly linked to atypical handedness, supporting the idea that disruptions in brain asymmetry may affect both language and motor function. Among the non-neurodevelopmental conditions, those with an earlier average age of onset, such as schizophrenia and PTSD, also showed elevated rates of non-right-handedness. These patterns suggest that early brain development may play a key role in shaping both handedness and vulnerability to certain psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results reveal that handedness differences are not uniformly present across all mental health conditions, but instead appear to cluster in disorders with strong neurodevelopmental components or those that impact language processing and early brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation is that analyses relied solely on categorical measures of hand preference (i.e., right, left, or mixed), due to limited availability of continuous handedness measures. This may have constrained the sensitivity of some analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000471"&gt;Handedness in Mental and Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Systematic Review and Second-Order Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Julian Packheiser, Jette Borawski, Gesa Berretz, Sarah Alina Merklein, Marietta Papadatou-Pastou, and Sebastian Ocklenburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 18:04:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOSEVqUzdWVEtBRlUxV2oxb2FYaDJqNVhDaWF3OVRacmpFeXJES0NXYTRBaTFIcUJYTlVDR05ueF9rRWtQTDlHdjBLNGtacGlpeGdfZEQ0dEx6LUtCRnRVYTBVUVJoTHg2aDAxNVhnUEtEWWo5WGZnNFJsNC1JRU9jTGowbWsxT29fbE9NZC1FQ1RrcHYwalljdFUtVnlsYklHQlFR</guid></item><item><title>这正是您每天预防慢性病所需的纤维量- TODAY.com | This Is Exactly How Much Fiber You Need Daily To Prevent Chronic Disease - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaVBNWHJUQ25SWE9icHR2ajZJVEhRaFktb3p2aG9qNzYwbURwaUk4RldNUGV0cldiQTYzRWRPWWpuX3Q0Q1lmckFKNkp4Ujd2TzRsQ2l3TUYtbVA0WVlCWVZZYlJmUW9LMEV5OFBVa2pTYWRLQUZUUDZud1hIR3hXSU5OUVRFTmZwQlJqa2o0SFZQbkxCeVF5SGkwNNIBVEFVX3lxTE9LcDFsM3J0RFlZYmF1bl9mT2ZqSzE4UjlhdEV1dTFoSGdpaWFTUFVDNHJBZnM3b1VYY0tzX1J1OHNTeWxJNkd2OXB5a1c2VXlNYWtMYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;We all know that fiber is important, but how much fiber should we eat each day to protect our health? It may be more than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This superstar nutrient helps support a healthy gut microbiome, promotes heart health, helps control blood sugar and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A fiber-rich diet also can prevent common chronic diseases, especially as we age, according Dr. Eric Topol, a renowned cardiologist and longevity researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TODAY.com previously spoke with Topol about the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/aging/eric-topol-longevity-research-tips-rcna205115" target="_blank"&gt;habits he follows every day to age healthy&lt;/a&gt; from his book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668?asc_campaign=&amp;amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fhealth%2Faging%2Feric-topol-longevity-research-tips-rcna205115&amp;amp;asc_source=direct_desktop" target="_blank"&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When it comes to his diet, Topol emphasizes plant-based foods and getting more of one nutrient in particular — fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Longevity expert tip of the day: Aim for 25-30 grams of fiber daily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Healthy eating” generally translates into a varied diet full of plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, Topol told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What do these foods have in common? They’re all good sources of dietary fiber, which is something we all need more of. “Fiber is really big," Topol added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Fiber-rich whole foods are the foundation of the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which Topol follows. The Med diet is well-studied and ranked as one of the most best eating patterns to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Every day, Topol aims to get 25-30 grams of dietary fiber. Nuts and seeds are one of his favorite fiber-rich snacks. Plus, they’re high in protein and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; "I try to take in as much fiber a day as possible," Topol adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The recommended intake of fiber is about 14 grams per 1,000 calories of food, per the &lt;a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/How-much-dietary-fiber-should-I-eat" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Agricultur&lt;/a&gt;e, so you may need more depending on your body composition and caloric needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Fiber benefits our health in many ways. In addition to promoting regular bowel movements, fiber helps us feel full, slows absorption of glucose, helps lower cholesterol and supports a healthy heart and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eating enough fiber is a key part of aging healthy, and it also helps prevent chronic and age-related diseases, explained Topol. These include &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-rising-young-people-lynch-syndrome-rcna100443" target="_blank"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the rise in the United States, and heart disease, the No. 1 killer worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31809-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;2019 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 185 studies showed that people who ate a high-fiber diet had a 15–31% reduction in all-cause mortality, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, compared to individuals who ate a low-fiber diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite these science-backed benefits, most adults in the U.S. don't eat enough fiber. The typical American diet is low in whole foods and high in what Topol considers the "polar opposite" of fiber: ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Don't reach for a fiber supplement. First, emphasize eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, Topol advised. These foods are not only great sources of fiber but also rich in other important nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Try adding these &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-fiber-foods-rcna168629" target="_blank"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-fiber-foods-rcna168629" target="_blank"&gt;igh-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt; to your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Almonds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

"This longer-run tragedy continued to unfold in the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;US death rates waned slower starting in 1980&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investigators analyzed all-cause death data in the United States and 21 other high-income countries (HICs) in the Human Mortality Database from January 1980 to December 2023.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;They calculated annual age-specific death rates for the United States and the population-weighted average of other HICs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mortality rates decreased more slowly in the US than in other high-income countries (HICs) between 1980 and 2019, resulting in growing numbers of excess US deaths compared with other HICs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team counted the number of US deaths that would have been expected each year had the country experienced the age-specific death rates of other HICs, computed ratios of observed-to-expected US deaths, and estimated the number of excess deaths attributable to the US mortality disadvantage. They fit a linear regression model to determine whether the number of excess US deaths in 2023 differed from the 2014 to 2019 prepandemic trend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Mortality rates decreased more slowly in the US than in other high-income countries (HICs) between 1980 and 2019, resulting in growing numbers of excess US deaths compared with other HICs," the study authors noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rates more than double comparable nations in young adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From 1980 to 2023, 107.5 million people died in the United States, and 230.2 million people did so in other HICs. During this period, an estimated 14.7 million excess US deaths occurred, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet there were still more than 1.5 million excess deaths in 2022 and 2023, and rates remained substantially elevated compared with those from before the pandemic. Other HICs saw less-pronounced pandemic surges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaps between the United States and other HICs widened before and during the pandemic, especially among younger adults, before shrinking in 2022 and 2023. Age-standardized death rate ratios comparing the United States with other HIC averages were 1.20 in 2010 (20% higher), 1.28 in 2019, 1.46 in 2021, and 1.30 in 2023. Death rates among US adults aged 25 to 44 years were 2.6 times higher than in other HICs in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deep cuts to public health likely to widen disparity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excess deaths attributable to the US mortality disadvantage peaked in 2020 and 2021, at 1 million in 2020 and 1.1 million in 2021, before declining to 820,396 in 2022 and 705,331 in 2023. These numbers followed four decades of increasing excess deaths, reaching 631,247 in 2019. In 2023, excess US deaths made up 22.9% of all deaths and 46.0% of those among people younger than 65 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman in the U.S. has died from severe neurological symptoms that were caused by an abnormal protein — which she was unknowingly injected with nearly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having shown no neurological symptoms in the decades since the injection, the 58-year-old recently began experiencing tremors and changes in her ability to balance while walking. In the following weeks, she developed urinary incontinence, difficulty speaking and abnormal breathing. After being admitted to hospital, she entered a coma and later died, according to a&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;case report published May 14 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article#suggestedcitation" target="_blank" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article#suggestedcitation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up MRI scan while she was in hospital revealed damage to her brain, and further testing showed positive results for an abnormal protein called a prion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prions are found in cell membranes, the wall that surrounds every one of our cells, and are thought to be one of the molecules &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2653553/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2653553/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;involved in cellular communication and other interactions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though prions can exist safely in the body, when these proteins accumulate in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they can cause surrounding proteins to contort and "misfold," damaging nerve cells.

At the time, this was common practice — as well as being used to treat pituitary conditions,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6616070/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6616070/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;hormones from cadavers were also given to women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose ovaries were not producing eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in 1985 researchers identified the first U.S. outbreak of CJD related to treatments with cadaver-derived growth hormones. The treatment was quickly suspended, and later a synthetic&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/us/synthetic-growth-hormone-cleared.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/us/synthetic-growth-hormone-cleared.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;alternative hormone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, produced by genetic engineering, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/12-0116_article" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/12-0116_article" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;0.4% of those treated in the U.S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with growth hormones taken from the organs of deceased individuals have gone on to develop CJD. How these hormones were infected with prions is still unknown, and scientists cannot yet explain why there is such a long latency period between the infection and the symptoms arising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no treatment available to those with CJD, or any other form of prion disease. However, ongoing&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#toc-how-is-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-diagnosed-and-treated-:~:text=receive%20hospice%20services.-,What%20are%20the%20latest%20updates%20on%20Creutzfeldt%2DJakob%20disease%3F,-NINDS%2C%20part%20of" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#toc-how-is-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-diagnosed-and-treated-:~:text=receive%20hospice%20services.-,What%20are%20the%20latest%20updates%20on%20Creutzfeldt%2DJakob%20disease%3F,-NINDS%2C%20part%20of" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;research projects seek to uncover treatments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers involved in the recent case study said that while the number of people developing CJD as a result of growth hormone treatment has slowed over the years, it is still possible that new cases will arise.&lt;/p&gt;

But while the pandemic has officially ended, the elevated death toll has persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers blame the ongoing crisis on a combination of drug overdoses, gun violence, traffic accidents, and chronic diseases like heart failure and diabetes, all of which are hitting the US harder than other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cited the lack of a robust social safety net — common in many European countries — as a major factor worsening the toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said the uptick was linked to surging overdose deaths from drugs among other factors.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression and anxiety can spread between married couples through shared mouth bacteria — healthy spouses showed increased mental health symptoms after just six months of marriage to a depressed partner.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Women appear more susceptible to this bacterial transmission — female spouses experienced more pronounced changes in both their oral microbiome and mental health scores.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This research could change how we treat mental health in relationships — healthcare providers may need to consider treating both partners as a unit rather than focusing on individuals alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEHRAN —&lt;/strong&gt; Marriage means sharing your life with someone special. But new research out of Iran reveals couples might be sharing more than they bargained for: the bacteria in their mouths — and potentially their mental health struggles along with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study of newlywed couples in Iran found that when one spouse suffers from depression and anxiety, their partner’s oral bacteria actually changes to mirror theirs. As those microbes shift, so do the healthy partner’s mood and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After just six months of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;, previously healthy spouses showed significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, and sleep problems if their partner had what researchers called the “depression-anxiety phenotype” — essentially, someone dealing with both conditions simultaneously along with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transmission between individuals in close contact partially mediates symptoms of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” the researchers concluded in their paper published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The journal notes that exploratory research published by it “does not necessarily need to be comprehensive and conclusive, but the study design must be solid, the methodologies must be reliable, the results must be true, and the hypothesis must be rational and justifiable with evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-bacteria-jump-between-partners"&gt;How Bacteria Jump Between Partners&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every time you &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/kissing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kiss your spouse&lt;/a&gt;, share a meal, or breathe the same air in close quarters, you’re potentially swapping millions of bacteria. Most bacterial exchange is harmless or even beneficial. But this study points to a pathway for mental health conditions to spread between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by independent researcher Reza Rastmanesh, tracked couples married for an average of six months. They recruited 1,740 couples from two private sleep clinics in Tehran between February and October 2024, comparing 268 healthy spouses with 268 partners who had depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Both groups took standardized mental health tests, provided saliva samples to measure stress hormones, and had their mouth bacteria analyzed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the study’s start, healthy spouses scored normally on tests for depression, anxiety, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. After six months of living with an affected partner, their scores climbed significantly higher — not quite matching their troubled spouse, but moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Can depression or anxiety really be transmitted through a kiss? New research suggests the swapping of oral bacteria could make it possible (Photo by PeopleImages.com – Yuri A on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More revealing was what happened to their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/oral-health-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mouth bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. The oral microbiome—the community of microorganisms living in our mouths—of healthy spouses began resembling that of their depressed and anxious partners. Using a technique called linear discriminant analysis, researchers found that specific bacterial families like &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; became more abundant in both partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These bacteria aren’t random. Previous research has linked these same microorganisms to brain disorders, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Scientists believe these bacteria may affect the brain by compromising the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-brain-barrier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; or through what’s called the “oral microbiota-brain axis”—essentially, a pathway of communication between mouth bacteria and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-show-stronger-effects"&gt;Women Show Stronger Effects&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Female spouses appeared more susceptible to these changes than men, showing more pronounced increases in depression, anxiety, and sleep problems after six months, along with greater shifts in their oral bacteria composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also measured &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cortisol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, often called the “stress hormone,” in participants’ saliva. Healthy spouses married to depressed and anxious partners showed significant increases in their cortisol levels over six months, indicating their stress response systems were being activated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This bacterial transmission theory builds on existing research showing how couples synchronize biologically — their heart rates can align during conversations, sleep patterns often mirror each other, and they share similar daily cortisol rhythms. What’s new here is the suggestion that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; conditions might spread through bacterial exchange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What This Means for Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings could reshape how we think about treating depression and anxiety in relationships. Instead of focusing solely on the individual patient, healthcare providers might need to consider the couple as a unit, potentially treating both partners even when only one shows obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research builds on compelling evidence from animal studies where scientists successfully transferred depression-like behaviors to healthy mice by transplanting gut bacteria from depressed animals. Other studies show that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;—beneficial bacteria—can improve mood and reduce anxiety in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this study has limitations. Researchers only followed couples for six months and didn’t account for other factors like shared stress from major life events, similar diets, or lifestyle changes that come with marriage. Participants were also aware they were being studied, which could have influenced their responses to mental health questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in Iran with Persian-speaking couples, so findings might not apply universally. While the study found strong correlations between bacterial changes and mental health symptoms, it can’t definitively prove the bacteria caused the mood changes—just that they occurred together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For couples, the findings offer both concern and hope. While no one wants to think they might “catch” their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/hugs-help-ease-pain-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;partner’s depression&lt;/a&gt;, understanding this potential mechanism could lead to better treatments. If bacterial imbalances contribute to mental health problems, then targeted probiotics or other microbiome interventions might offer new therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also reinforces what marriage counselors and therapists have long observed—that mental health conditions affect entire families, not just individuals. This study provides biological evidence for that clinical experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/relationship-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;close relationships&lt;/a&gt;, couples may share more than they realize—including microscopic influences on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 536 Iranian couples (268 couples total) who had been married for an average of six months. They recruited participants from two private sleep clinics in Tehran between February and October 2024. One spouse in each couple had what researchers called the “depression-anxiety phenotype”—meaning they scored high on standardized tests for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II score of 14 or higher), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory score of 16-25), and sleep problems (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index indicating poor sleep). The other spouse was healthy at the study’s start. Participants completed mental health questionnaires, provided saliva samples for cortisol measurement, and had oral bacteria collected from their tonsils and throat. The bacterial samples were analyzed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques to identify and quantify different bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses showed significant increases in depression, anxiety, and sleep problem scores compared to their baseline measurements, though they remained lower than their affected partners’ scores. Their oral bacteria composition changed to become more similar to their depressed and anxious spouses, with specific bacterial families (Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae) becoming more abundant. Salivary cortisol levels also increased significantly in the healthy spouses. Female spouses showed more pronounced changes than male spouses across all measures. The researchers found that oral bacteria patterns could predict depression-anxiety status and that bacterial changes correlated with mood and stress hormone alterations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study followed couples for only six months, which may not capture long-term effects. Participants knew they were being studied, potentially influencing their questionnaire responses. The research didn’t control for confounding factors like shared diet, stress exposure, or frequency of intimacy between couples. The study used self-report questionnaires rather than clinical psychiatric diagnoses. Only morning saliva samples were collected for cortisol measurement, and bacterial sampling was limited to tonsils and throat due to budget constraints. The sample consisted entirely of Persian-speaking Iranian couples, limiting generalizability to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re at elevated risk for breast cancer, but mammograms often miss tumors buried in dense breasts — and insurers often resist paying for additional scans that may help find the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Now a large study comparing various types of scans has found that mammography enhanced with iodine-based dye can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And so-called contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors than standard mammograms, the study found, but are considerably more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The scans were given to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that hadn’t turned up any abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Contrast-enhanced mammography needs to become standard of care for women with dense breasts,” if they are at high risk of developing breast cancer, said Dr. Fiona J.

But does walking &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-actually-build-muscle-when-you-work-out-1" target="_blank"&gt;build muscle&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743516303838?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on global participation rates in sport, walking was found to be the most popular physical activity among adults in four of six global regions including the Americas. But are we accomplishing anything more than getting away from our desks for a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to our bodies when we walk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a physiological perspective, walking is a whole body activity,” says Professor &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson"}' href="https://pure.ul.ie/en/persons/brian-carson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Carson&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist at the University of Limerick and head of science at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://wholesupp.com/collections" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://wholesupp.com/collections"}' href="https://wholesupp.com/collections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Whole Supp&lt;/a&gt;. “When we walk we use our muscles to propel us, which increases our energy expenditure, thus increasing the metabolic demands placed on our muscles and the body as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any exercise, our &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/four-easy-breathwork-routines-for-a-calmer-day" target="_blank"&gt;breathing&lt;/a&gt; speeds up in order to deliver more oxygen to our muscles. But, because walking is relatively steady state—i.e. not too taxing—we’re unlikely to get out of breath unless there’s an added stressor, like going uphill or at a faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a neurological effect. “Our brain and nervous system become more active as we take in and process sensory information from the environment around us and from the movement itself, while at the same time providing stimulatory output to the muscles in a coordinated sequence to help us move fluently,” says Carson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://aaalab.stanford.edu/assets/papers/2014/Give_your_ideas_some_legs.pdf"&gt;2014 Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt; determined that walking provides a significant boost to creative thinking during and after the activity, with an 81% increase in creativity measured in a divergent thinking test compared to when sitting down. Walking outside promoted the highest levels of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while all of this is happening, our body is taking nutrients from our muscle, fat and liver tissues in order to convert them into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else does walking help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re dragging a petulant dog after you, walking is generally considered a good way to unwind. This is because when we walk at a comfortable pace, our parasympathetic nervous system is activated, triggering a reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-cortisol-levels"&gt;cortisol, the stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can also help our brains grow. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21282661/"&gt;A 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 older adults found that regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, increased the size of the hippocampus and raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. “This is like fertilizer for your brain, helping brain cells to grow, strengthen and communicate more effectively with each other,” explains Abigail Ireland, peak performance strategist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.understandingperformance.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.understandingperformance.com/"}' href="https://www.understandingperformance.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Understanding Performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key benefits of walking is to interrupt sedentary behaviors such as sitting, Carson’s colleagues found in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9325803/"&gt;meta analysis&lt;/a&gt; carried out at the University of Limerick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The speed at which we walk has an influence, with faster walking resulting in better health outcomes such as predictors of &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/761.long"&gt;all cause and cardiovascular mortality&lt;/a&gt;,” Carson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But does walking build muscle or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gym lore has it that &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/cardio-and-strength-training-1" target="_blank"&gt;cardio&lt;/a&gt; kills gains as our bodies metabolize our muscles for energy. And it turns out that walking doesn't really build size—although Carson points out that in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/98/6/2604/2537326?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; where step counts were reduced to below 1,500 steps per day, participants saw muscle protein synthesis reduced by 28%, even after a high protein meal, and significant reductions in leg lean mass.  &lt;a data-offer-url="http://www.apple.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.apple.com"}' href="http://www.apple.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found some walking was better than sitting all day. Ireland points to a third &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6240935/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found that walking combined with resistance training is much more effective in maintaining muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 15:18:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBCaDlyTTB1Qk9OUDcxUHhHbm9PWHFOTDFITmhVSXk5VkxPNkJyWXJqd1JhMDh2U3NKempMT042blBzMHJiN0RzZUZOZjU5aWd5UDgwdHRReVI1VFh2a2dJUWNJVWVMUXZFc2dPQmtqNA</guid></item><item><title>视频：养狗人与金毛猎犬玩饥饿河马- AOL.com | Video: Dog Owners Play Hungry Hippo With Golden Retriever - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBtNE1sUzA3aG9CbmxkbXhEYmNpWjFna3NnalN2VHNRdkFXdS1nQ21RRkgwakJQbTREOVR6NUNYRlMyNGtYVU1FdGF6UktiM3RCZmxwQlp5eWp6RHhVQmVDMzQ3cUhzc0RMVDJaZmxRQnh3RVRvX2gxVE0xWXB3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @sundaythegoldenretriever / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you grew up in the ’90s, you probably remember the chaos and fun of playing Hungry Hungry Hippos — slamming down plastic tails and watching marbles fly across the board. It was loud, fast-paced, and undeniably entertaining. Now, imagine swapping those marbles for dog kibble and replacing one of the players with a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;. That is exactly what played out in a viral video, where a clever pup turned family game night into a snack-fueled showdown the internet can’t stop watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever wins against owners at Hungry Hippo in viral video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI9Da6IOQhO/?igsh=MXRuNGM2ejlzd2t1Mw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; uploaded by Instagram user @sundaythegoldenretriever shows the beloved family pet, Sunday, joining her humans in a hilariously reimagined version of Hungry Hungry Hippos. In the reel, the Golden Retriever is seen seated at a table alongside three human family members, all ready to play. However, instead of using traditional marbles, the owners fill the game board with kibble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as one of her humans calls “Go!”, Sunday springs into action, quickly gobbling up the scattered dog food across the board. Meanwhile, the human players frantically tap the tails of their plastic hippos. At one point, the canine even plants her front paws on the table, fully focused on claiming victory. By the end, the pup clears all the food, leaving little for the others and emerging as the undeniable champion. As her owner aptly sums it up in the caption, “We brought our A-game; she brought her appetite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many viewers commented with laughter and praise for the dog’s spirited performance. One user wrote, “Who says Sunday isn’t athletic?” while another joked, “HAHA Sunday said there is no competition here.” Others were impressed with her efficiency, saying, “She cleaned it right up.” Even Hasbro, the official maker of the Hungry Hungry Hippos game, jumped into the comments, writing, “When the paws hit the table… game on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to bond with your dog, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/lifestyle/dog-activities/1092-games-every-dog" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interactive games;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interactive games&lt;/a&gt; you can enjoy together at home. Food puzzles, hide and seek with treats, snuffle mats, and obstacle courses are all great for mental and physical stimulation. You can also teach your dog new tricks, play tug-of-war, or create scent games that tap into their natural instincts. Some families even adapt human games — like Sunday’s Hungry Hippos version — just be it’s safe and fun for your furry companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/177538-golden-retriever-dog-owner-hungry-hippo-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Dog Owners Play Hungry Hippo With Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: Dog Owners Play Hungry Hippo With Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 15:16:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBtNE1sUzA3aG9CbmxkbXhEYmNpWjFna3NnalN2VHNRdkFXdS1nQ21RRkgwakJQbTREOVR6NUNYRlMyNGtYVU1FdGF6UktiM3RCZmxwQlp5eWp6RHhVQmVDMzQ3cUhzc0RMVDJaZmxRQnh3RVRvX2gxVE0xWXB3Zw</guid></item><item><title>眼科手术技术可以恢复黄斑变性的视力-神经科学新闻 | Eye Surgery Technique Could Restore Vision in Macular Degeneration - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE94YlJEYkIwSDNwMF9ZaWVIRmlhY2NOTmQyWjJRclhSOVYyUzMyYUJHQ3p6bE1XbUdJVzdndlItR2M1YnhwSmYtSmZfXzU4Tm96RXZiQU83NWFGbzRUYmNWZ3lMeTY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have developed a novel surgical method allowing two retinal tissue grafts to be implanted in a single eye, advancing treatment strategies for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This new approach enables side-by-side testing of grafts—one with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and one without—within the same lesion, using a specially designed clamp to maintain eye pressure and reduce damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal models, the RPE grafts significantly preserved light-sensing photoreceptors and regenerated the choriocapillaris, the blood vessel layer essential for retinal health.

Scientists are testing therapies for restoring damaged retinas with grafts of tissue grown in the lab from patient-derived stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, surgeons have only been able to place one graft in the retina, limiting the area that can be treated in patients, and as well as the ability to conduct side-by-side comparisons in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such comparisons are crucial for confirming that the tissue grafts are integrating with the retina and the underlying blood supply from a network of tiny blood vessels known as the choriocapillaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the technique, investigators designed a new surgical clamp that maintains eye pressure during the insertion of two tissue patches in immediate succession while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal models, the scientists used their newly designed surgical technique to compare two different grafts placed sequentially in the same experimentally induced AMD-like lesion. One graft consisted of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown on a biodegradable scaffold. RPE cells support and nourish the retina’s light-sensing photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AMD, vision loss occurs alongside the loss of RPE cells and photoreceptors. In the lab, RPE cells are grown from human blood cells after they’ve been converted into stem cells. The second graft consisted of just the biodegradable scaffold to serve as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post surgery, scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze retinal images and compare the effects of each graft. They observed that the RPE grafts promoted the survival of photoreceptors, while photoreceptors near scaffold-only grafts died at a much higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they were able to confirm for the first time that the RPE graft also regenerated the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings expand on the capability demonstrated in an ongoing, NIH-led first-in-human clinical trial of patient-derived RPE grafts for the dry form of AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AMD and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dd3d4d5cdeff8eeeeddf3f4f5b3faf2eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH Office of Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH Office of Communications – NIH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.179246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iPSC-RPE patch preserves photoreceptors and regenerates choriocapillaris in a pig outer regina degeneration model&lt;/a&gt;” by Kapil Bharti et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPSC-RPE patch preserves photoreceptors and regenerates choriocapillaris in a pig outer regina degeneration model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of untreatable vision loss. In advanced cases, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell loss occurs alongside photoreceptor and choriocapillaris degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that an RPE-patch would mitigate photoreceptor and choriocapillaris degeneration to restore vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE (iRPE) patch was developed using a clinically compatible manufacturing process by maturing iRPE cells on a biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare outcomes, we developed a surgical procedure for immediate sequential delivery of PLGA-iRPE and/or PLGA-only patches in the subretinal space of a pig model of laser-induced outer retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep learning algorithm-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) image segmentation verified preservation of the photoreceptors over the areas of PLGA-iRPE–transplanted retina and not in laser-injured or PLGA-only–transplanted retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive optics imaging of individual cone photoreceptors further supported this finding. OCT-angiography revealed choriocapillaris regeneration in PLGA-iRPE– and not in PLGA-only–transplanted retinas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data, obtained using clinically relevant techniques, verified that PLGA-iRPE supports photoreceptor survival and regenerates choriocapillaris in a laser-injured pig retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequential delivery of two 8 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; transplants allows for testing of surgical feasibility and safety of the double dose. This work allows one surgery to treat larger and noncontiguous retinal degeneration areas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 14:59:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE94YlJEYkIwSDNwMF9ZaWVIRmlhY2NOTmQyWjJRclhSOVYyUzMyYUJHQ3p6bE1XbUdJVzdndlItR2M1YnhwSmYtSmZfXzU4Tm96RXZiQU83NWFGbzRUYmNWZ3lMeTY</guid></item><item><title>Delmarva的医院有多安全？最新分数对当地医疗保健的评价- CoastTV | How safe are Delmarva's hospitals?

                                &lt;p&gt;DELMARVA - Whether you're heading in for surgery or rushing a family member to the emergency room, the hospital you choose can affect more than your insurance bill; it can shape how safely you leave. Twice a year, a national nonprofit tries to answer a crucial question: How safe are the hospitals you rely on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade report shows where Delmarva's hospitals excel at preventing harm and where room remains to improve. Behind each letter, however, is a deeper story about surgical complications, infection risks, communication and how growing communities are shaping the quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five Delmarva hospitals received A's, one received a B and three received C's when it comes to safety, according to Leapfrog's spring 2025 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an improvement from fall 2023, when &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/hospital-safety-concerns-no-delaware-facilities-receive-as-in-recent-assessment/article_b8e31004-7f44-11ee-882e-77870f0b1bca.html" target="_blank"&gt;no Delaware hospital received an A&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, TidalHealth Peninsula Regional in Salisbury was the only hospital on Delmarva with an A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leapfrog's twice-yearly scorecard aggregates more than 30 measures of infections, safety, preventative practices, surgical outcomes, staffing and communication to rate hospitals across the country from A to F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scroll to the end of this article for a hospital-by-hospital breakdown of scores and what they mean for patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the nine hospitals that serve Delaware and the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland— TidalHealth Peninsula Regional, TidalHealth Nanticoke, Atlantic General and ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals— earned A's in the spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade.

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOW SCORES ARE DETERMINED&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leapfroggroup.org/about" target="_blank"&gt;The Leapfrog Group&lt;/a&gt;, a Washington-based national nonprofit that collects, analyzes and publishes data on healthcare safety and quality, conducts programs like the safety grade, which evaluates nearly 3,000 hospitals nationwide on how well they keep patients safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These safety grades, issued every spring and fall, are determined by using performance measures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, surveys submitted by hospitals and supplemental data sources. Measures are then weighted based on evidence, opportunity for improvement and impact. Hospitals missing too many measures do not receive a safety grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring 2025 grades reflect data from between 2021 and 2024, depending on the category. &lt;a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/your-hospitals-safety-grade/about-the-grade" target="_blank"&gt;Because of Leapfrog's scoring methodology&lt;/a&gt;, Hospitals missing too much data aren't graded. For those that are, each measure is weighted based on its impact on patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart below is comprised of data for different measures that are &lt;a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/your-hospitals-safety-grade" target="_blank"&gt;compiled by the Leapfrog Group&lt;/a&gt; to determine a hospital's letter grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOW LOCAL HOSPITALS COMPARE NATIONALLY&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of serving largely rural areas and growing coastal populations, Delmarva's hospitals performed well on several key national safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, these nine facilities have physicians with advanced training in intensive or critical care working in their ICUs, which even some larger urban hospitals did not. Six local hospitals met Leapfrog's standard for electronic prescribing, a practice that helps prevent errors. Three others saw considerable achievement in this area, according to the Leapfrog data. All of Delmarva's hospitals reported zero cases of "never events" like air embolisms, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wins suggest that, despite smaller labor pools, core systems to prevent many potentially catastrophic errors have been implemented. Yet, these same hospitals sometimes stumble on equally critical metrics that hinge on day-to-day bedside care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/beebe-healthcare-faces-growing-strain-as-sussex-county-expands/article_74164ebe-a9b7-4548-999d-2a55ac9e35b1.html" target="_blank"&gt;serving southern Delaware's explosive growth&lt;/a&gt; like Beebe, Bayhealth Sussex and Bayhealth Kent reported bed sore rates worse than the U.S. average. Bayhealth Kent ranked among the nation's poorest performers in patient fall fractures and collapsed lungs after procedures. Even the area's only straight-A hospital, TidalHealth Peninsula Regional, reported a surgical complication death rate closer to the nation's poorest performers than to its best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenges aside, there are some bright spots. For the first time, Leapfrog is recognizing &lt;a href="https://www.leapfroggroup.org/news-events/leapfrog%E2%80%99s-spring-2025-safety-grades-are-%E2%80%94-new-trend-data-shows-one-eight-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;straight-A hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, or those that have earned an A for five or more consecutive reporting periods. TidalHealth Peninsula Regional is the only hospital on Delmarva to achieve this status, joining just 12 percent of eligible hospitals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-Atlantic neighbor New Jersey is one of the top five states in the country with the highest share of straight-A hospitals, with 27 percent of its eligible facilities receiving this status. It is also one of six states with the highest percentage of A grades this spring. Though an influx of out-of-state license plates shows that New Jerseyans love moving to Delaware, it may not be for healthcare. The first state is, by contrast, one of 12 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with no straight-A hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looked at together, the data paint a nuanced picture; Delmarva's hospitals can meet or exceed high-standard structural requirements, but patient care issues still appear in bedside-level harms that technology and checklists alone can't yet erase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY THIS SPRING&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all of the measures Leapfrog evaluates, one in particular stands out as a potential regional red flag: deaths from serious, treatable complications after surgery. Four Delmarva hospitals scored worse than the national average in this category. Two others were slightly above average. The remaining three did not receive a score in this category, meaning they did not have enough data to report for this measure, not that they withheld information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth Peninsula Regional had the lowest available local score despite its straight-A status. ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals reported the best numbers for Delmarva in this spring's report and were the only ones on the peninsula slightly above the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-07aed8cb-909b-44f9-8ece-9ce3b2e254cb" data-instance="#gallery-items-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;After surgery, patients can sometimes develop serious complications while still in the hospital, such as pneumonia, have a heart attack or lose function in their kidneys or liver. These numbers represent the number of surgical patients who died for every 1,000 people who had a serious treatable complication after surgery, according to Leapfrog. &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to infections, most hospitals in Delaware and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland performed better than expected when it came to infections like C. diff and MRSA, two potentially dangerous bacteria commonly spread in healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. diff can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, often after antibiotic use. The University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton scored very well when it came to C. diff, while it performed worse than expected for MRSA, which is a type of staph infection that resists many antibiotics and can be spread through contaminated equipment or unwashed hands. Preventing these infections comes down to hygiene, from handwashing to proper equipment sterilization, and the data suggests most local facilities are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-6cf6625e-4dc3-4b9e-9476-132b47c90b05" data-instance="#gallery-items-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;The plotted numbers represent comparisons made during Leapfrog's scoring process when it comes to infections. The comparison looks at the number of infections that actually happened at a hospital compared to the number expected for it, given the number of patients cared for on a daily basis and how widespread these bacteria are in the local community. A number lower than one means fewer infections occurred than were expected, while a number greater than one means more infections than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOSPITAL-BY-HOSPITAL&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letter grades can offer a quick snapshot, but they don't tell the full story. Each grade is a weighted blend of more than 30 performance measures. Some measures scores are drawn from fresh data, while others are from years ago; some reflect hospital-reported surveys, others come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means a hospital can excel in one area, like infection control, but fall short in another, like preventing surgical complications.

&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TidalHealth – A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth, including both the Peninsula Regional facility in Salisbury and the Nanticoke facility in Seaford, received A's through the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade this spring. The Nanticoke facility maintained the A rating it achieved in the fall, which was preceded by a B in spring 2024 and C's in 2023 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Achieving an A grade for a second consecutive period reflects the deep commitment of our entire team in Seaford to uphold the highest standards in clinical excellence, safety practices and compassionate care," said Penny Short, president of TidalHealth Nanticoke. "We're proud to serve our community with the safest and most reliable healthcare in downstate Delaware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peninsula Regional has maintained A's straight back through 2023, with B's in 2022. That being said, even as the only straight A hospital on Delmarva, it had the worst score for the measure which looked at patient death from serious treatable complications when compared to others locally. Complications in this measure include pneumonia, heart attack or losing function in an organ. Leapfrog says these types of complications are serious but can be treated by a good hospital team. It is worth noting, as mentioned above, that three of the nine Delmarva hospitals included in this article did not report scores for this measure, and of those that did, they remained below or around average when compared nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth Peninsula Regional and TidalHealth Nanticoke scored below average when it came to patient falls; however, when looking directly at the data and not just comparisons to other hospitals, the picture may change. In this case, below-average means that, at TidalHealth Nanticoke, which received the worst score between the two, less than one person out of 1,000 patients who were eventually discharged experienced a fall or similar trauma, according to Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanticoke's communication with doctors, nurses and staff received high marks from patients. Scores for this measure represent a zero-to-100 scale based on patients' perspectives of how effectively doctors and nurses explained things and listened to them. Nanticoke also scored well for the speed of response of hospital staff when patients request help for pain, new symptoms or cannot reach the bathroom alone. Nanticoke received the highest scores for nurse communication and hospital staff response on the Peninsula, with a 93 and 85, respectively. In these three staff-patient communication categories, Nanticoke was joined by Atlantic General in receiving above-average scores; in fact, Atlantic General had the highest peninsula score for doctor communication with a 93.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overall hospital, Atlantic General also received an A alongside the two TidalHealth facilities, a good sign given the &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/joining-forces-atlantic-general-hospital-now-under-the-tidalhealth-umbrella/article_1236b8b6-a14a-4c28-9a44-a7a05bb73a9c.html" target="_blank"&gt;new partnership between these healthcare systems that began May 1&lt;/a&gt;, which brings Atlantic General under the TidalHealth umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Safety is foremost for all healthcare providers. Our team at Atlantic General Hospital worked extremely hard over the past year to improve to an A, which is an outstanding achievement in support of their patient safety mission," said Steve Leonard, president and CEO of TidalHealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its doctor communication score, Atlantic General also had the best score on Delmarva when it came to communication about discharge, but the worst score for C. diff infections. According to the Leapfrog safety grade results, Atlantic General received a 1.23 for C. diff infection. This number represents a comparison of the number of infections that actually happened to the number expected for this hospital based on its number of patients and how widespread C. diff is in the local community. A number higher than one means more infections than expected, according to Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="bay"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayhealth – C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayhealth's Kent and Sussex facilities have had different trends in recent years. While the Kent campus has received a C for the past six Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades dating back through spring 2022, the Sussex campus has shown a downward trend. In 2022, the Sussex campus received an A in both the spring and fall. In 2023 and spring of 2024, the hospital received B's. Starting in the fall of 2024, Bayhealth Hospital's Sussex campus received a C, which it got again this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At Bayhealth, we are deeply committed to delivering exceptional care and the best possible experience for all the patients we serve across our facilities," Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Kyle Benoit tells CoastTV. "We are disappointed that our recent Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades of C this year do not fully reflect the outstanding dedication and high-quality care our clinicians provide daily."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at specific measures, the Sussex Bayhealth campus had the worst score of Delmarva's hospitals for surgical site infection after colon surgery. This score, a 2.124, is below the national average and represents the number of infections after colon surgery that actually happened compared to the expected number for this hospital. Numbers above one mean more infections occurred than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Kent campus in Dover, scores were not good for patient falls. In particular, this facility's Leapfrog score was equal to the worst score received by all hospitals across the nation for collapsed lungs, at 0.65 for every 1,000 people, and falls that cause broken hips, at 0.56 per 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sepsis, Bayhealth Kent was also a bit below the national average and the lowest scoring on Delmarva. According to the spring 2025 Leapfrog safety grade, 5.63 surgical patients per 1,000 experience sepsis across the country. At Bayhealth, that number is 6.69 patients per 1,000, followed next by Bayhealth Sussex at 5.29, which is actually slightly better than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these reports from post-surgery care, the Bayhealth Kent campus received above-average scores when compared to hospitals across the nation for not having problems with surgery, including surgical wounds splitting open, blood leakage, kidney injuries and accidental cuts and tears. Both Bayhealth facilities also received top marks for effective leadership structures that increase awareness of patient safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These scores are not where we aim to be, and we have multiple teams actively developing detailed action plans to enhance our quality metrics and address areas needing improvement," Benoit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="beebe"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beebe – C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beebe has generally remained steady, receiving C's in five out of the last six Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade reports, including this spring. Beebe received a D in spring 2024. Beebe's last A was given in the spring of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for comment, Beebe Healthcare President and CEO Dr. David Tam told CoastTV that, while Beebe recognizes the value of independent surveys and takes every opportunity for improvement seriously, the organization does not feel the recent Leapfrog score reflects the quality of care that Beebe clinicians and staff members provide to patients and the community each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tam also pointed out that this spring's scores rely on historical data, not the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Beebe consistently meets or exceeds several other quality and safety standards, as is reflected in our ranking as the &lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/de" target="_blank"&gt;number two hospital in Delaware, according to U.S. News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;," Tam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Delmarva, Beebe scored worst for kidney injuries after surgery and harmful events. Beebe received a 2.12 in the spring 2025 Leapfrog safety score, a number that represents the estimated number of times patients experienced kidney failure after major surgery for every 1,000 people who had surgery. It's worth noting that patients who are older or have other pre-existing health problems are at a greater risk of experiencing kidney failure, and Beebe is in the heart of coastal Sussex County, which has seen an influx of retirees in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Beebe scored by far the worst when compared to other local hospitals when it came to bed sores. The hospital's score of 7.16 patients with dangerous bed sores for every 1,000 people discharged was closer to the national worst of 7.5 than it was to the next closest Delmarva facility, which was the Bayhealth Sussex campus with a score of 1.83. Bed sores are wounds on the skin that form when a patient remains in the same position for too long without being moved. Advanced bed sores can become large and deep, potentially reaching muscle or bone and leading to pain or serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Beebe reported improvements in areas such as handwashing, receiving a 100 this spring compared to a 40 in the fall of 2023, and beating the national average number of patients that experienced a sepsis infection, which was also below average a year-and-a-half ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Beebe received a positive score for central line-associated blood infections. Scores in this category represent a comparison of the number of blood infections that actually happened at Beebe compared to the number expected there based on the number of central lines used and other factors like facility type and size. According to Leapfrog, Beebe had fewer infections that would have been expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Beebe spokesperson shared with CoastTV that the hospital celebrated several quality and safety achievements in 2024 and continued success into this year, including zero central line-associated bloodstream infections and four years in a row without one of these types of infections in the ICU. The hospital also achieved more than a 50 percent reduction in patient falls through its fall prevention task force, according to Beebe, which evaluates the causes of patient falls and identifies opportunities to improve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beebe also received positive Leapfrog scores from patients when it came to communicating information about home care and the help they would need during recovery, including written information about symptoms or issues to watch for during recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Quality and safety efforts are never complete for any health system. Day after day at Beebe, we evaluate and apply evidence-based improvement methods to identify, define, measure, analyze and improve processes, systems and structures to achieve the highest standards for patient safety and secure the best patient outcomes," Tam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="christ"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChristianaCare – A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals have been on the upswing in recent years when looking at their Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade reports. The Christiana hospital received an A this spring, the highest score received in recent years. ChristianaCare's Christiana hospital received B's in 2024 and C's in 2023. This spring, the Wilmington hospital maintained its A rating from the fall, which was an improvement from a B in spring 2024 and a C's in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington hospital's MRSA infection score was the best on the peninsula, determined by Leapfrog as being better than expected for a facility like it. In fact, this hospital was the only one on Delmarva that reported above-average scores when compared nationally in all measures related to infection, including for C. diff infections, infections in the blood or urinary tract, surgical site infections after colon surgery and sepsis after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Wilmington and Christiana facilities are slightly above average when it comes to deaths from serious treatable complications after surgery and had the best scores on Delmarva with both reporting 170.41 surgical patient deaths for every 1,000 people who had a serious treatable complication after surgery, down from the 177.45 national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ChristianaCare hospitals also had above average scores in a variety of safety categories like avoiding falls, collapsed lungs, dangerous blood clots and potentially harmful events after a surgery, procedure or childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="um"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UM Shore Medical Center – B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shore Medical Center in Easton has remained generally consistent over the past three years in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. It received a B this spring, the same score received in 2024. Before that, it received A's in 2023 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring, the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center did worse than a hospital like it was expected to when it comes to MRSA infections, receiving a below-average score nationally and the worst score on Delmarva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it had the best Delmarva score of 5.3 per 1,000 surgical patients who experienced serious breathing problems. This score was well below the national average of 10.53, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that deleting this four–amino acid segment from a synapse-building protein, PTPδ, disrupted neural activity and led to anxiety-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mini-exon enables PTPδ to bind with another protein, IL1RAP, forming a complex critical for excitatory synapse development. This discovery helps explain how subtle changes in genetic splicing may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, ADHD, and OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini-Exon B Function:&lt;/strong&gt; A 4–amino acid segment in PTPδ enables essential synaptic protein interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing mini-exon B caused reduced survival, synaptic dysfunction, and anxiety-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The disrupted signaling pathway mirrors patterns seen in autism, ADHD, and OCD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have identified a remarkably small but critical piece of genetic code that helps determine how brain cells connect, communicate, and function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery not only deepens our understanding of how the brain’s wiring is built but may also explain the origins of several neurological and psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110324"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg" alt="This shows genes and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings are especially relevant given the growing evidence that disruptions in microexon splicing may underlie several neuropsychiatric conditions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by the Center for Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions at IBS and led by Director KIM Eunjoon (Distinguished Professor at KAIST), focuses on a protein called PTPδ—a key molecule that helps neurons form synapses, the connections that allow brain cells to pass signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While PTPδ has already been linked to disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, OCD, and restless leg syndrome, the researchers have now zoomed in on a previously unstudied detail: a tiny segment known as mini-exon B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mini-exon is created through a process called alternative splicing, in which cells include or exclude specific snippets of genetic material to slightly alter the structure—and function—of a protein. Mini-exon B is just four amino acids long, yet the team found it plays a surprisingly powerful role in brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Closer Look at the Brain’s Synaptic “Glue”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he brain’s ability to think, feel, and move depends on a delicate balance of electrical and chemical signals. These signals travel across synapses, where one neuron passes a message to the next. Proteins like PTPδ help these synapses form properly by acting like molecular Velcro—linking neurons together with precise alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers genetically engineered mice to delete mini-exon B from the PTPδ gene. The results were dramatic: Mice missing mini-exon B entirely had a survival rate of less than 30% after birth, highlighting its essential role in early brain development and viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, mice with one copy of the gene altered survived into adulthood but displayed clear behavioral changes, including anxiety-like behavior and reduced movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain recordings in these mice also showed a misbalance in synaptic activity. Granule cells—neurons responsible for processing information—received weaker excitatory input, while interneurons, which help keep brain activity in check, received stronger excitatory signals. This excitation-inhibition imbalance is a hallmark feature of various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Clues: A Lock-and-Key Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover how this tiny segment affects brain signaling, the researchers examined the proteins interacting with PTPδ. They discovered that PTPδ forms a molecular complex with another protein called IL1RAP—but only when mini-exon B is present. Without this mini-exon, PTPδ loses its ability to engage IL1RAP, disrupting a critical pathway for forming excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interaction turned out to be cell-type specific, meaning it behaves differently depending on which neurons are involved. This level of specificity explains why the deletion of mini-exon B affects some parts of the brain more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director KIM Eunjoon remarked, “This study illustrates how even the tiniest genetic element can tip the balance of neural circuits. It’s a compelling reminder that errors in alternative splicing could have profound consequences in brain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Human Brain Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate the function of PTPδ’s mini-exon B. The findings are especially relevant given the growing evidence that disruptions in microexon splicing may underlie several neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions like autism and ADHD have been increasingly linked to impaired synaptic development, and this study helps explain one mechanism by which that might happen. It also highlights the need to study not just genes themselves but the tiny variations in how they’re assembled by the cell’s machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, these insights could inform the development of therapies that target splicing regulation or help restore normal synaptic balance in affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with KAIST, KBSI, KISTI, Kyungpook National University, and Yonsei University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eunjoon Kim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eunjoon Kim – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59685-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alternatively spliced mini-exon B in PTPδ regulates excitatory synapses through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic PTPδ-IL1RAP interaction&lt;/a&gt;” by Seoyeong Kim et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternatively spliced mini-exon B in PTPδ regulates excitatory synapses through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic PTPδ-IL1RAP interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTPδ, encoded by &lt;em&gt;PTPRD&lt;/em&gt;, is implicated in various neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTPδ trans-synaptically interacts with multiple postsynaptic adhesion molecules, which involves its extracellular alternatively spliced mini-exons, meA and meB. While PTPδ-meA functions have been studied in vivo, PTPδ-meB has not been studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that, unlike homozygous PTPδ-meA-mutant mice, homozygous PTPδ-meB-mutant (&lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;–/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) mice show markedly reduced early postnatal survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterozygous &lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice show behavioral abnormalities and decreased excitatory synaptic density and transmission in dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs). Proteomic analyses identify decreased postsynaptic density levels of IL1RAP, a known trans-synaptic partner of meB-containing PTPδ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, IL1RAP-mutant mice show decreased excitatory synaptic transmission in DG-GCs. &lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DG interneurons with minimal IL1RAP expression show increased excitatory synaptic density and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, PTPδ-meB is important for survival, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes and regulates excitatory synapses in cell-type-specific and IL1RAP-dependent manners.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 14:16:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5xSmlGR0V6ZHd4QXpGNnVDSS1QRnZjRlMwX1kwUXJJTjB1NHFZOEJQcHdnRjJQUnFVMDZ5amFhWndTdVFhNUF5anBKRHFZR29aS1dLcGhWLVdsQWs2UWs0Zk53Zk0ydDRidUtyYl92UQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，焦虑依恋与浪漫关系中的抑郁溢出有关- PsyPost | Anxious attachment linked to depression spillover in romantic relationships, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNWmtISmZJYnRySDV1M1hFSTF5WDloWF9LbGhpWGRTc1NUWnA5MWcyYnBPcERZV0FXeFR2YjNFSWxwQUJDRjJ1NlZkTmEzWTdZQk9RNDZzN0xfbHNfckl5MnRpS1pySlBDTXRJOF9nLXo5WkdCUFgySm1VOFIxclo5a0tna0N2aFRwNmdJM1QwSHY5ZmItUDJIN1ZmZ094cjZIUWc4VVB4LU5nS2ZJMFladk5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from Germany has found that women with anxious attachment styles face a slightly elevated risk of depressive symptom spillover from their partners. In other words, when their partners reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiously attached women were slightly more likely to experience increases in their own depressive symptoms compared to securely attached women. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pere.12584"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms include persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep, and difficulty concentrating. While major depressive disorder is a common mental health diagnosis, many individuals experience depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms often do not remain isolated. In romantic relationships, one partner’s depressive symptoms can influence the other partner, potentially leading to increased symptoms over time. This phenomenon is referred to as spillover or crossover of depressive symptoms. However, because both partners are often exposed to similar external stressors, it is sometimes unclear whether such changes are due to true spillover or shared environmental influences affecting both individuals simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Preston C. Morgan and his colleagues sought to examine the extent to which a partner’s anxious attachment moderates the spillover of depressive symptoms over time in romantic relationships. Specifically, they wanted to determine whether men’s or women’s initial depressive symptoms could predict changes in their partner’s symptoms over a four-year period—and whether this effect was influenced by anxious attachment. Anxious attachment is a relational style characterized by a heightened fear of abandonment, increased sensitivity to rejection, and a strong need for closeness and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (Pairfam), using five waves of data collected between 2010 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final sample included 1,179 heterosexual couples who remained together throughout the study period. At the start of the study, the average age was approximately 36 for men and 33 for women, and 72% of the couples were married. Participants completed validated assessments of depressive symptoms and anxious attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants’ initial levels of depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with changes in their partners’ depressive symptoms across the four-year period. However, women’s anxious attachment significantly moderated this association. In particular, women with higher levels of anxious attachment were slightly more likely to experience increases in their own depressive symptoms when their male partners had elevated depressive symptoms at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, depressive symptoms in one partner seem to be at least partially transferrable to the other romantic partner. This depressive symptom spillover seems to occur at the same time point, but men’s and women’s initial depressive symptoms were not associated with changes in their partner’s depressive symptom trajectories—limiting the spillover effect. However, this long-term spillover effect may occur in one context. Specifically, women who are more anxiously attached—seeking increased reassurance—are at an even higher risk for depressive symptom spillover within their romantic relationships,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the depressive symptom spillover effect within couples. However, it should be noted that the mean depression level of study participants was low and that these were not clinically depressed individuals. This may have limited the magnitude of detected spillover effects. Furthermore, the study sample was limited to couples who remained together during the study period. Results on other categories of individuals may differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pere.12584"&gt;Depressive symptoms spillover between romantic partners partially explained by anxious attachment&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Preston C.

We think a single proteomic test can increase that diagnostic yield to 50-70% of suspected patients,” said Prof David Thorburn, another author of the research from the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the study focuses on using the test for mitochondrial diseases, Stroud said it was already applicable to about half of the 7,000 known rare diseases, although more work was needed to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stroud added that for mitochondrial diseases as little as 1ml of blood from a newborn was required for the procedure, whereas current techniques involved a muscle biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Furthermore, while a mitochondria-focused version of the test has a similar cost to current techniques, it is not specific to one kind of rare disease. That not only makes it more cost-effective but, as Stroud noted, it also means patients could avoid having to take other unnecessary tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This has obvious benefits to both the patient and healthcare system,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A diagnosis not only sheds light on the disease, and – in some cases – possible treatments. It also helps parents who are considering having further children by raising the possibility of pre-natal genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Michal Minczuk, a professor of mitochondrial genetics, at the&lt;br&gt;
 University of Cambridge, and who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research. “Overall, the paper marks a very significant step forward in diagnostic practices by introducing a robust, rapid, and minimally invasive method for confirming and characterising genetic disorders,” he said. “This could greatly enhance patient care by expanding the tools available for clinicians and researchers in genomic medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Robert Pitceathly, a professor of clinical neurology and mitochondrial medicine at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, agreed. “The next step is broader validation and integrating this technology into NHS diagnostic services to improve patient outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 14:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQUHF1SVdKZWc1NHZjRjdpWmhXTVpqRXdSbk41T2VQclh5RXpoX091c0ZwN0JDbnBoVEt2Z2dSN0w0bHFFRlJSZy1oM1ZOTEViRndZUW85VVpQeFhUOXdISXI3SGZDOTZMNHVDZkgzTW5kUER0S2JYM1I5akZhQ0xLZm1nRk1iREJPM1lqajdSaW1hQ3EtSjlKWFpUQUlJME44Ri1J</guid></item><item><title>医生透露“经常被忽视”的身体部位，您必须每天清洁，否则将面临严重的健康问题-每日邮报 | Doctor reveals 'often overlooked' body part that you MUST clean everyday, or risk serious health issue - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQdEhKSHNtZUIzOXg4TlRqS0ZsQVhpak54OXZKN0xsQWcweEg2R0gwem1sWTAxTFBMX1RLV3p5c2owOVNabTVrbEs3YV9hU2xLVEFNcEd3VVJUSUxJLXRiVTlpQXQtdjV4QkQ2aERJbTZJSWpIOEJGRXRWS19QMTFXZDlETnlhQTFhU0U2WGJMd0FuS0phWk9pU2YyZkw4eXV2Q2oyYzFmWnVNQdIBrwFBVV95cUxPWEhienhVcllxYXVLQUJzU3RjMUZDWFRpOTNLUlh2MDE4RW9nUkw2N3RoSDQxcGZkSG1tVlFCQU1lazNyM0xVY2Jkbkt2TEp1MWFVVVV6SXdseC1hS2xaLUZQSGdvN2NjUTdYaU9NXzNNdlhHTUNGZ0dIeXRxMGdFeFdZMk1nLW5rWGtvWTh1RVdSZ0Vlb3JPbnY3NWt1QVY0NTh2b3BXZkVzTG4zYmtN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

And while many migraine sufferers find relief by working with a physician to identify what may be causing their condition, narrowing down the exact cause isn’t always an easy process. Ask five people what triggers their migraines, and you’ll probably get five different answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people get quick and easy answers – finding that things like avoiding chocolate or keeping hydrated can help. Others have a more difficult journey to identifying their triggers, especially if they are lesser known. We talked to real life migraine sufferers and experts who treat them to hear about 8 things you may not know that can cause migraine to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scented garbage bags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some migraine sufferers, certain scents can bring on a migraine attack. A common trigger is perfume, with some studies showing that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15546266/#:~:text=Conclusions:%20Osmophobia%20and%20taste%20abnormality,in%20females%20than%20in%20males." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:odors like perfume;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;odors like perfume&lt;/a&gt; can trigger migraines in 50% of people who get them. You can take proactive measures like avoiding using scented lotions and body washes but sometimes smells can sneak up on you. For Christina Sees, a 40-year-old resident of New Jersey, it was scented garbage bags that were an unexpected trigger for her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Typically at home we use unscented trash bags,” she shares. “We always have and I never really noticed or realized that they even sold scented ones. Then one day I accidentally bought scented ones at the store and that was the end of it.” Sees felt the effects instantly and experienced her usual dose of migraine symptoms. “In general, fragrances such as plug-in air fresheners, flowers or perfumes, will instantly get me sick,” she says. “It starts with nausea and blurry vision or clamminess first, then the headache comes on.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After realizing the bags made her head pound, she threw the whole box out. “I forgot about it for a while until it happened again,” says Sees. “I generally learn about my migraine triggers through patterns and repetition.” She also has to avoid using the trash cans at work since those trash bags are also scented. Her company, she says, is working on switching them to unscented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trigger that Sees has learned to watch out for is the sun. “If I'm out in 73-degree weather or hotter with bright sunlight, I get frantic and am desperate to get out of the sun within five minutes because after 15 minutes the nausea begins and then I'm down for one to two days,” she reveals. Sees was working outdoors last week for what she thought would be a brief session, but it ended up being a warm day and she felt sick after 20 minutes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I can't go to the beach or pool,” she says. “Finding shade or wearing a hat can help extend my ability to sit outside, but not by much.” The American Migraine Foundation recommends taking the following steps to make time out in the sun more manageable for migraine sufferers: stay hydrated, seek out shade, cool yourself off with a spray bottle of water or a cold bandana around your neck, exercise in air conditioning if possible and stick to your meal and sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Periods of calm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people recognize the onset of stress as a common migraine trigger, I discovered that I get migraines with stress release,” says Desola Awofeso, a 41-year-old in Houston, Texas. “I’ve worked in high-stress roles for years and could never understand why the end of the workday or the weekend would usher in strong auras, followed immediately by severe migraines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finding an app to track her symptoms and describing them to her neurologist over time, her doctor was finally able to figure out the cause: the flood of stress being released all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines happening at the conclusion stressful incidents is more common than people think, says Dr. Danielle Wilhour, a neurologist at UCHealth. “I often see patients experience a let-down migraine, not during a big event, but right after it’s over, when your body finally relaxes,” she says. “Intense physical exertion, such as a tough workout, hot yoga, or even sexual activity, can also spark an attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Awofeso’s doctor explained that her migraines were likely triggering because of the sudden drops in cortisol and adrenaline after work, she was able to put together a plan to help herself cope. “I learned that if I gradually released stress throughout the day — instead of all at once — I could reduce those sudden drops in hormone levels and potentially reduce the migraines. So, with that in mind I started taking short 'brain breaks' throughout the workday to gradually decompress. It was a small shift but has been super effective in preventing my stress-release migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giving birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines have been linked to changes in hormones, making them something that can appear in women &lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/postpartum-headache/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:postpartum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;postpartum&lt;/a&gt;. Statistics show that one in four of women will experience a migraine within two weeks of delivery and almost half will experience migraines within the first month of giving birth. Laura Haver, a 46-year-old in Chicago, Illinois, was one of those women whose migraines were triggered after childbirth. “I believe it was from exhaustion post emergency c-section and as a new mom,” she says. “Yet it continued on for years well past the birth of my second child.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors could not figure out what was wrong. “I went to different doctors, neurologists, naturopaths, chiropractors and more. No one could do anything useful, and I regularly found myself in bed for days at a time,” Haver recalls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, Haver hired a coach to assist with her writing, coaching, and speaking career, who introduced her to the healing power of energy work. “It was a game changer! It made such a big impact on my life and health, and I got trained myself to help others."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her health in mind, Haver created her own daily energy practice. “It's a unique fusion of energy clearing, meditation, mindfulness, and more,” she says. “It helps me release the stresses and pressures of everyday life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Traveling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Werner, a 43-year-old resident of Prattville, Alabama who has battled migraines for the past 30 years, has found that traveling can trigger her headaches. “My husband actually noticed it before I did, just saying that I always get a migraine during our vacations,” she says. She’s not alone. Others have found travel to be a situation that sets off a migraine. This can be for a variety of reasons that include flying at high altitudes, dehydration, stress, skipped meals, changing routines and different diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately now that she knows that travel is a trigger, Werner has found a way to make taking trips more comfortable. “I keep a really regular sleep schedule, eat my usual foods, stay well hydrated, avoid alcohol, and may even schedule a massage while we're on vacation,” she says. “It takes a little planning, and honestly, I usually still get a migraine, but it's much less intense and disruptive with those strategies.” She also has her doctor prescribe her medication when a migraine sets in. “It helps get me back to normal within a few hours, which is so much better than it was before!” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fluorescent lighting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2017, I have suffered from sudden, disorienting ocular migraines that blur my vision, distort my sight, and leave me exhausted. It wasn’t until I noticed a pattern—episodes following exposure to bright LED headlights, harsh fluorescent office lights, or losing focus while staring at screens—that I realized light sensitivity and overstimulation were significant triggers,” says Bernard Charles, a 34-year-old digital project manager in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors confirmed Charles was experiencing ocular migraines, often triggered by visual and social stress coupled with neurological overstimulation. To navigate his diagnosis, he’s tried all sorts of things and eventually found ways to bring himself some relief. “I wear blue-light-filtering prescription glasses, use dark mode across devices, and reduce screen brightness,” he says. He’s also shifted his lifestyle by cutting caffeine and sugar, leaning into plant-based foods, and adopting a diet centered around reducing inflammation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When a migraine happens, you immediately go into fear, anger, and depression,” says Charles. He finds meditating or sleeping are ways to help things calm down. “I now know that light pollution — from the television to the checkout station at the store — has also triggered my migraines, so I take extra precautions to reduce eye strain and keep my internal voice positive when exposed to these elements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Poor oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your oral health is important to help maintain your teeth and gums, but poor oral health and habits could be contributing to migraines. “The jaw joint, when under stress from misalignment or clenching, can trigger pain that radiates into the head and mimics migraine symptoms,” says Nicole Khalife, a general dentist, and a dental practice owner at&lt;a href="https://www.luxsmilesnyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lux Smiles NYC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Lux Smiles NYC&lt;/a&gt;. Treating these symptoms can help. “One patient’s migraines had been so persistent that they were considering more invasive procedures—until we discovered the problem stemmed from jaw tension caused by grinding at night,” says Khalife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dental trigger that can contribute to headaches is misalignment or missing teeth. “When the bite is uneven, the muscles of the face and jaw compensate, and that extra work can trigger headaches that feel like migraines,” says Khalife. “Replacing missing teeth or correcting bite issues with simple dental adjustments can bring real relief.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even inflammation from gum disease or untreated tooth decay can be a hidden contributor. “Chronic oral infections or swelling can radiate pain into the head and neck,” adds Khalife. “Many people don’t connect the dots right away because the pain doesn’t always feel like it’s coming from the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re a big gum chewer with migraines, listen up. “Excessive chewing—especially gum—can overstimulate jaw muscles and trigger headaches, especially in people prone to migraines,” says Dr. Joseph Goodman, CEO of &lt;a href="https://topbeverlyhillsdentist.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TopBeverlyHillsDentist.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TopBeverlyHillsDentist.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tech neck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself staring down at your phone more times throughout the day than you can count? Some reports say we (gulp) look at our phones upwards of &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/19/how-to-cut-back-screen-time/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:144 times a day!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;144 times a day!&lt;/a&gt; All that can add up to chronic neck and shoulder pain, known as &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tech-neck-is-a-pain-in-more-than-just-the-neck/#:~:text=Tech%20neck%20is%20any%20form,the%20shoulders%20to%20slump%20forward." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tech neck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt;. “Posture and jaw position are connected,” says Goodman. “Constant phone or screen use can lead to forward head posture, straining the neck and jaw, and potentially leading to migraines.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning signs that your tech habits could be contributing to migraine tension include headaches after long hours on the phone or computer, stiffness in the neck or upper back and jaw clenching while concentrating, adds Goodman. To reduce your risk, he recommends adjusting your screen to eye level, taking frequent stretch breaks, sitting upright in your chair versus bending forward and straining your spine. And one position you should definitely avoid when making a call? “Holding the phone between shoulder and ear,” says Goodman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/migraine-sufferers-talk-8-surprising-migraine-causes-11740086" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:36:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFAzWVpwb2p2M1F5bW02V20xUUE4Tmhhb3J0a0VwWkFtOFZRT2J5TGd6cHhqYTg1ek5Kd0Uxb3U2OC1NZG5STWlQd25ER3VjU0ZwZGZYTXJnLTgwM2ctLXJEUWVjQmZmQkZsVl9rMmFsWE5RSUVyMl9GTzdfRQ</guid></item><item><title>您应该始终与鸡蛋一起吃的令人惊讶的水果- AOL.com | The Surprising Fruit You Should Always Eat With Your Eggs - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE52ZVU1NXdjQlhBTjkxQVg2MXA3cFJnMnBKNmtOVkZWYzJWR285Wktyc05NVmZ2OEtybndneXRFUUJuOFR5RlJ4ZTB4d1Bza3M5MThIR0pvN2RSSU80MEFmck9HNFNQXzBoNXNtdjQzSElra1U1UXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;10 Nutritious Food Combos You Need to Be Eating&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;NataBene - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to unlocking the full health benefits of your food, sometimes one plus one equals three. This is the power of “nutrition synergy” — a concept doctors and dietitians agree everyone should know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To put it simply, certain food pairings work better as a duet than as a solo,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dietitianjess.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopDyM3U6XLj7slPeMKWXdxifUhtvHtBLe5D_Q8Fz-YnuV6Sb3j-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jess DeGore, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jess DeGore, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt; “When combined, they boost the body’s ability to absorb and use specific nutrients, helping you get the maximum benefits. This helps support improved immunity, energy, digestion and beyond.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging this concept is a powerful way to be more intentional about healthy meals. “People often ask which nutrient is the most important for their health, but the real key is eating a variety of whole foods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.frugalnutrition.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the blog Frugal Nutrition. “The fun part is that there are tons of synergistic dynamic duos to incorporate into your diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, experts share the best food combinations to add to your meal planning rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinach and Lemon Juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of lemon juice on your spinach does more than just add flavor. Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of iron, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Iron is an important nutrient, especially for healthy blood. Because the iron in plant-based iron foods like spinach is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not as bioavailable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;not as bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; as animal-based iron foods, it needs a little boost from sources of vitamin C,” says &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/normalizing-your-nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Normalizing Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Normalizing Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “Also, cooking your spinach increases the availability of iron.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other smart pairings include citrus fruits, cantaloupe or strawberries (which all have plenty of vitamin C) with iron-rich foods like lentils, quinoa or tofu. Using citrus marinades on meats is another great way to boost iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking carrots, especially with olive oil, can make them even more nutritious, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S146685640700046X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because beta-carotene — an antioxidant found in carrots — is fat-soluble. That means your body absorbs it better when eaten with healthy fats. Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:converts beta-carotene into vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;converts beta-carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which is crucial for your vision, immune function, cell growth and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad Greens and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots aren’t the only veggie that benefit from a drizzle of olive oil. Fats aid your body in absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K — which makes olive oil a nourishing dressing for all kinds of salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the easiest things you can do is add an olive oil-based dressing to your next salad,” says Caravella. “There are often many fat-soluble vitamins found in a diverse salad, and the salad dressing provides the fat to assist the body in better absorbing their nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless for this synergistic duo: You can find vitamin A in tomatoes and red bell peppers, D in mushrooms, E in nuts and seeds and K in leafy greens, broccoli and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs + Berries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know there are heart-health benefits to pairing fiber with cholesterol-rich foods? “Soluble fiber transforms into a gel-like substance in the digestive system, which traps cholesterol and prevents it from entering your bloodstream,” explains Self. “In other words, the body does a better job at digesting cholesterol when fiber is there to help take out the excess. That’s why eggs, which contain cholesterol, and berries, which are rich in fiber, make a wonderful duo.” Other beneficial fiber-rich sides for your eggs include apples, pears, beans, avocado and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs and Raw Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a nutrition boost from eating your eggs with raw vegetables. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5086793/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating 3 whole eggs with a salad increased the absorption of carotenoids — a type of phytonutrient with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects — up to eight-fold more than eating the salad on its own. Keep hard-boiled eggs on hand to embrace this powerhouse combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salmon and Broccoli &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/calcium-and-vitamin-d-important-bone-health#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20promotes%20bone%20health,our%20muscles%20and%20immune%20system." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plays a crucial role;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in helping your body absorb calcium. That makes salmon (which contains the vitamin) and broccoli (a good source of calcium) an ideal pairing to help keep your bones strong, says Caravella. Tuna, egg yolks and tofu are other great sources of vitamin D that can be paired with calcium-rich foods like kale, collard greens and fortified dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric and Black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is packed with antioxidants that help protect your cells, but its benefits are amplified when paired with black pepper. Pepper enhances turmeric’s bioavailability, which helps your body absorb its health-promoting properties, explains DeGore. So next time you make a golden latte or stir-fry, don’t forget to add a dash of pepper!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raspberries and Dark Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re craving a sweet treat, consider raspberries and dark chocolate. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S088915751500071X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, combining cocoa with raspberries can significantly enhance the antioxidant effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice and Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans are great source of protein, but they’re a bit limited because they don’t contain all nine amino acids that our bodies need to function. Eating a variety of proteins helps you get the essential amino acids it needs. Likewise, you can make a protein-packed plate by pairing a plant protein and a grain — like beans and rice. “On their own, they’re missing some essential amino acids, but together they deliver all nine that your body needs but cannot produce on their own,” says Carvella. “This duo is especially beneficial for those who primarily eat a plant-based diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Wheat Bread and Peanut Butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole wheat bread and peanut butter are another powerful plant-based protein duo. Each one contains the amino acids that the other lacks so when you eat them together you can get all the amino acids you need. Ideally, look for bread that has whole-grain flour or whole-wheat flour listed as the first ingredient. You can also add sliced bananas to your sandwich for added fiber and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:21:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE52ZVU1NXdjQlhBTjkxQVg2MXA3cFJnMnBKNmtOVkZWYzJWR285Wktyc05NVmZ2OEtybndneXRFUUJuOFR5RlJ4ZTB4d1Bza3M5MThIR0pvN2RSSU80MEFmck9HNFNQXzBoNXNtdjQzSElra1U1UXc</guid></item><item><title>金毛小狗坚持自己走回家，我们痴迷于他的自信-雅虎 | Golden Retriever Puppy Insists on Walking Himself Home and We’re Obsessed with His Confidence - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNblQtcm51OHlZWUVYMjRuME00dGF1OXc0eXhNMjRFWUFadndyVzdWNUF6SzVpTFNjNktSc0U1RHpTUS1qS3V1T2JyRXdoak1zX1NrcENvcU9QYnViVE03bE85Qkl1QnhBOF9kNW83UWVHbTlvNk8yQkNHUXF1NUk0Q1pBZURiWnVtZFVpcXRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Puppies are always eager to explore the world, but some, right from the start, take their independence very seriously and want to prove to the world they can do anything they set their mind do. In a dog, when confidence meets cuteness, it's game over for our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an adorable video, we meet a Golden Retriever puppy who decides he’s more than capable of taking the reins after their evening walk. He’s got the confidence of someone who’s been on this planet for far longer than just a few weeks, and we’re in love. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On May 14, 2025, Reddit user Exact_Rate_6661 posted a video in r/goldenretrievers of their tiny Golden Retriever puppy and it might be one of the cutest clips we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the video we meet a small pup who is very much in charge of his life, and his parents. He doesn’t care that he’s been on the planet for a short amount of time because when he wants something, he knows how to get it and doesn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s dark outside and he’s probably getting very sleepy, given how much energy we’re watching him expel in this video. He grabs his blue lead from his parent’s hands and decides to walk himself home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With his tail wagging and his mouth proudly holding his own lead, he trots along like a seasoned pro. It’s equal parts adorable and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-dead-stare-meeting-sibling-wins-internet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever's Dead Stare Upon Meeting New Puppy Sibling Wins the Internet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Golden Retriever's Dead Stare Upon Meeting New Puppy Sibling Wins the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the comments, many Reddit users chimed in with some thoughts on this adorable Golden Retriever, and had only the most kind words to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One person wrote, “Many puppies do this. He's very young. I predict this behaviour will change. You won't be able to get him home in a few weeks when he's a bit older and more interested in the outside world and abundant smells. Cheers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another shared, “He thinks he's walking &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Someone else added, “They are all the same haha my 8mo old will still try to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One joked, “Look at me - I am the leash owner now!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other comments included, “Aww, I miss when my girl was that little and did that,” “He’s a strong independent floof that doesn’t need no hooman to lead him,” “C’mon hooman,” “Just a big boi doing big boi things,” and “My guy did this too when he was little. I use a belt leash, so I imagine in his mind this was him walking me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One user offered some advice, writing, “They may grow out of it, and they may not.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meal plans are meant to be enjoyed, so definitely mix and match meals or choose a substitution if there is one you don’t like. We set this plan at 1,800 calories and aimed to spread protein and fiber throughout the day. If you’re making a substitute, it might be helpful to choose a meal that contains a similar amount of protein and fiber to the meal you’re replacing to help mitigate blood sugar spikes. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8037919/high-fiber-high-protein-mediterranean-diet-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;15+ High-Fiber, High-Protein Mediterranean Recipes&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely. Each breakfast is about 400 calories, while each lunch is between roughly 350 to 400 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so choosing one option to have for the whole week shouldn’t disrupt the total numbers significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
