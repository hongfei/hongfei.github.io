							&lt;p data-start="320" data-end="370"&gt;Getting older doesn’t have to mean slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="372" data-end="638"&gt;In fact, I’ve met people in their seventies and eighties who are more active and full of life than some folks in their forties. The difference? They don’t sit still for long. They’ve built movement into their everyday routines through hobbies they genuinely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="640" data-end="744"&gt;Here are seven that come up again and again when you ask energetic people over 65 how they keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="751" data-end="781"&gt;1. Walking with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="783" data-end="923"&gt;You might think walking is too simple to count, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s accessible, low-impact, and can be done almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="925" data-end="1137"&gt;The people I’ve seen turn walking into a hobby don’t just stroll aimlessly. They walk with intention—whether that’s exploring a new neighborhood, hiking a trail, or joining a walking group that makes it social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1139" data-end="1420"&gt;One man I know in his late seventies wakes up every morning, grabs his headphones, and sets out for a three-mile loop around his town. He treats it almost like meditation, syncing his steps with music or podcasts. It’s movement, yes, but also a daily ritual that keeps him sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1422" data-end="1688"&gt;As noted by the American Heart Association, regular walking &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/walking/every-step-counts?.com"&gt;improves cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, boosts mood, and even sharpens memory. And when older adults treat it as something to look forward to, not just “exercise,” it becomes the backbone of their energy routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1690" data-end="1830"&gt;Even small variations—changing routes, adding inclines, or walking with friends—turn this simple act into something surprisingly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1837" data-end="1852"&gt;2. Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1854" data-end="2001"&gt;I once stumbled into a salsa class while traveling in Mexico City. Half the class was over sixty, and they were outdancing the twenty-somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2003" data-end="2180"&gt;That’s the thing about dancing—it works because it blends fun with movement. There’s rhythm, community, and a sense of play that makes people forget they’re exercising at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2182" data-end="2506"&gt;And it’s not just about cardio. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020748921001723?.com"&gt;Dancing challenges coordination&lt;/a&gt; and balance, keeping the brain sharp with every step and turn. Studies back this up: dance improves memory, coordination, and neuroplasticity—and is even linked to lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2508" data-end="2770"&gt;I’ve also noticed that older adults who keep dancing tend to be more socially connected. Whether it’s ballroom, line dancing, or just grooving in the living room, it’s hard not to smile when you’re moving to music. And that joy is part of why it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2777" data-end="2794"&gt;3. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2796" data-end="2919"&gt;There’s something powerful about tending to plants. You bend, squat, lift, dig, and carry without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2921" data-end="3098"&gt;My grandmother used to say her roses kept her young. Looking back, I think she was right. Gardening gave her a daily reason to move, stretch, and stay outside in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3100" data-end="3359"&gt;What fascinates me is how holistic gardening really is. Physically, it’s like a light workout spread across hours. Psychologically, it reduces stress and provides a sense of purpose. And spiritually—if you want to go there—it’s grounding in a literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3361" data-end="3643"&gt;A growing body of research backs this up. A 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1142456/full?.com"&gt;horticultural therapy&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces depressive symptoms in older adults, especially when activities are participatory and conducted in care-providing settings over 4 to 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3645" data-end="3765"&gt;It’s not about having a perfect lawn. Even container gardens on a balcony or indoor plants can bring similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3772" data-end="3788"&gt;4. Swimming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3790" data-end="3888"&gt;If there’s a single activity that almost every energetic older person recommends, it’s swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3890" data-end="4007"&gt;Why? Because water takes the pressure off joints while still giving you resistance. It’s exercise without the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4009" data-end="4297"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another post, but I learned the value of swimming when I injured my knee a few years ago. It was the only thing that kept me moving pain-free. That same principle applies to people over 65—it allows them to stay active without worrying about wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4299" data-end="4462"&gt;One retired teacher I know swears by his morning laps. “The pool is the only place I feel completely free,” he told me. “It’s like the weight of age disappears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4464" data-end="4711"&gt;Many community centers offer senior swim hours or aqua aerobics, making it a social outlet as well. And let’s not forget: swimming works almost every muscle in the body while building cardiovascular endurance. It’s hard to beat that combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4718" data-end="4752"&gt;5. Practicing yoga or tai chi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4754" data-end="4899"&gt;“Stillness in movement, and movement in stillness.” That’s how a tai chi teacher once described it to me when I was visiting Beijing years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4901" data-end="5084"&gt;For older adults, practices like yoga and tai chi offer more than just flexibility. Tai chi, for instance, has been shown to significantly &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tai-chi-the-winner-at-warding-off-falls?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 58%&lt;/a&gt; compared to stretching—and improve balance, stability, and muscle reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5086" data-end="5285"&gt;Yoga, meanwhile, strengthens posture, flexibility, and mobility. A review of 33 randomized controlled studies found that &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/03/strong-evidence-that-yoga-protects-against-frailty-in-older-adults/?.com"&gt;yoga improves walking speed&lt;/a&gt;, leg strength, and other markers of frailty—hallmarks of sustained independence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5287" data-end="5537"&gt;I’ve seen seniors who’ve practiced yoga for decades hold poses with more grace and strength than younger people who only dabble in it. And they often say the mental benefits—reduced anxiety, clearer focus—are just as important as the physical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5539" data-end="5662"&gt;These practices prove that energy isn’t always about speed or intensity. Sometimes it’s about sustainability and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5669" data-end="5684"&gt;6. Cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5686" data-end="5840"&gt;Cycling isn’t just for young commuters in Lycra shorts. I’ve seen retirees in California cruising on e-bikes or pedaling along coastal trails with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5842" data-end="6068"&gt;What makes cycling powerful is that it gets the heart rate up while being relatively gentle on the joints. Traditional bikes build endurance, while e-bikes allow older riders to scale their effort depending on how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6070" data-end="6303"&gt;This combination of flexibility and freedom makes cycling an energy-boosting hobby that can be adapted as people age. And there’s something freeing about moving quickly under your own power—even if it’s with a little electric help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6305" data-end="6534"&gt;One couple in their seventies I met while traveling through Portugal told me cycling is what keeps their relationship strong. “We’ve ridden thousands of miles together,” the wife said. “It keeps us talking, keeps us exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6536" data-end="6639"&gt;That social and exploratory element makes cycling more than just exercise. It’s adventure at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6646" data-end="6668"&gt;7. Playing sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6670" data-end="6779"&gt;Pickleball, tennis, golf, even ping-pong—the specific sport doesn’t matter as much as the spirit behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6781" data-end="6982"&gt;Sports get people competing, laughing, and connecting. They provide structure (weekly games, friendly matches) that keep people accountable, and they engage muscles that don’t get used in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6984" data-end="7267"&gt;Pickleball in particular has exploded in popularity among retirees. It’s less demanding than tennis but still offers a fast-paced game that keeps reflexes sharp. And it’s accessible—many community centers have converted tennis courts to pickleball courts because demand is so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7269" data-end="7483"&gt;I’ve seen whole communities of retirees built around these games. They aren’t just exercising—they’re belonging to something bigger. And that sense of play might be the most underrated energy booster of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7485" data-end="7642"&gt;As psychologist Stuart Brown has said, “Play is not just an activity; it’s a state of mind that helps us stay resilient.” That’s doubly true in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7649" data-end="7669"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7671" data-end="7783"&gt;Staying full of energy after 65 isn’t about grinding away on a treadmill or following strict fitness regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7785" data-end="7920"&gt;It’s about choosing hobbies that feel joyful, that bring movement naturally into the day, and that connect body, mind, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7922" data-end="8028"&gt;The people who stay active later in life don’t think of it as “working out.” They think of it as living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8030" data-end="8137"&gt;So maybe the better question isn’t &lt;em data-start="8065" data-end="8093"&gt;which hobby should I pick?&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em data-start="8098" data-end="8135"&gt;which one makes me feel most alive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Several people were exposed to and infected with measles after attending an event at Soldier Hollow, the &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Utah Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt; confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 16, the Utah DHHS reported that approximately 2,000 people attended a Utah High School Cycling League event at Soldier Hollow. The department said it “has confirmed that several people were exposed to and infected with measles,” but did not disclose how many people, or the origin of the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events,” Dr. Leisha Nolen, epidemiologist for the State of Utah, said in a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nolen advised that attendees and participants of upcoming cycling league events check their MMR vaccination status to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said it is working to inform people of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah public health is working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of race participants who attended the Soldier Hollow event on August 16, 2025. We are also working collaboratively to help prevent spread at ongoing practices and upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah HHS said symptoms usually begin within one or two weeks after initial exposure. Those symptoms can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mild to moderate fever with a cough that later spikes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runny nose,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;red, watery eyes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blotchy rash appearing first along the hairline and behind the ears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department advised that if you develop symptoms, it’s important to protect others from exposure by staying away from other people and calling your healthcare provider before going to a clinic or hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="25e52957-7aa0-4399-9a1c-5603f3713521"&gt;COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 7 million people across the world, to date, including over 1 million people in the U.S., &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank" data-url="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

How relatively able are they to transmit? And [two], how lethal are they? How serious is the illness that they create, and the number of deaths?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on both SARS and MERS before COVID came along. [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SARS and MERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are severe coronavirus infections that predate COVID-19.] Those were two viruses that basically had the ability to kill 15% to 35% of the people that it infected, but they weren't nearly as infectious because they didn't have the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACE receptor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capacity. [SARS-CoV-2, in comparison, plugs into the ACE2 receptor on human cells.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then along comes COVID, which basically has this highly infectious characteristic but fortunately, the case-fatality rate and serious illness was substantially lower than what we saw with MERS and SARS. Just in the last six months, there's actually been the isolation of new coronaviruses from bats in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that actually have both [high infectiousness and high lethality] now. They actually have the ACE receptor capacity as well as that segment of the virus that was responsible for causing such severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So imagine a next pandemic where it's as infectious as COVID was, but instead of killing 1% to 2% of the people [it infected], it killed 15% to 35% of the people. That's exactly the example we're talking about with The Big One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true with influenza. You know, we've not seen a really severe influenza pandemic &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dating back to 1918&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, relative to what it could be. And clearly there are influenza pandemics there, in a sense, waiting to happen. In the future, someday, that could easily be similar to or worse than what we saw with 1918 flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we're trying to give people a sense that nobody's dismissing how severe COVID was, or what it did. It was devastating. But devastating with a "small d," not a "capital D," when you compare it to what could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="5ff90948-f751-478e-a622-4ef88c19f6ac"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Michael Osterholm, author of the book "The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics," warns that America is not prepared for the next pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of the University of Minnesota)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="db3e9cbf-b45a-4576-82c8-f14f12f71ef4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You mentioned both coronaviruses and influenza. Do you think the pathogen that sparks the next pandemic will belong to one of those groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;We refer to these as "viruses with wings" in our book — you have to have a "virus with wings" to really make it into the pandemic category. I don't think there's a bacteria right now that would fit that characteristic; it really is in the virus family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest likelihood is going to be an influenza [virus] or coronavirus. Sure, there could be a surprise infection that comes up, but it'll have to have characteristics like flu and coronavirus in the sense of respiratory transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Could you clarify what you mean by "virus with wings?" What gives a virus pandemic potential?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the things that made, for example, SARS and MERS easier to contain was for many of the [infected] individuals, they did not become highly infectious until after they're already clinically ill. But with COVID, we saw clearly a number of people who were actually infecting others when they were still asymptomatic, or they remained asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It [a "virus with wings"] has to have the airborne transmission capability, and that's the key one right there. … It would also be a virus that is novel to the society and that wouldn't have pre-existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You make the case in the book that you can't necessarily prevent a pandemic pathogen from taking off, but you can mitigate its harm. Why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think exactly why we give the reader the scenario, because you can see the conditions on the ground in Somalia. [&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Throughout "The Big One," the authors return to a thought experiment in which a pandemic virus emerges in Somalia and then spreads around the world, despite efforts by health officials to contain it.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every city, every camp, every clinic, every health care-related event is actually real. But you can see very quickly how a virus that emerged from an animal population — in this case camels — got into humans and how fast it moved around the world before anybody recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="71969cc9-4482-4ba6-80db-dfe5b554d5a4"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough [vaccine] for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e0ff69d0-f797-42db-b93a-b4f02b6eab39"&gt;These viruses are by nature highly infectious, and in a very mobile society, they are going to move. It just again illustrates that once that leaks out, it's out, it's gone. You can't unring a bell. Whereas other diseases that may be much slower to emerge and less likely to cause widespread transmission, you might be able to get to, but not easily with the pandemic. It's just gone. That's "wings," right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: And when you talk about mitigating pandemics, you make the point that governments must be involved, that industry can't do it alone. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Let me just say: I regret we didn't have six more months on this book. So many things have changed even from the time that the last manuscript went in at the end of last year and now, just because of what's happened in the Trump administration. We have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic. The office that normally did this work in the White House has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been totally disbanded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [that being the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy]. And there's no expertise there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if we had a major influenza pandemic and we needed vaccine, we'd be using the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embryonated chicken egg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only means we have for any large-volume production of vaccine. Novavax has a cell-based one, but it's very limited how much can be produced. Even with all the global capacity, we could only make enough vaccine in the first 12 to 18 months for about one-fourth of the world. So three-quarters of the world in the first year of the pandemic wouldn't even see a vaccine, and it would take several years more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House. HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] said no more, $500 million is down. The money had been given to Moderna to actually develop prototypes ready to go so that if we needed them, we wouldn't have to go through the long laborious process of getting them approved. We get them approved now with the strain change issue [left for when a pandemic virus emerges].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, that is like losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet [9,100 meters] — it's a devastating situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'These decisions were completely reckless': Funding cuts to mRNA vaccines will make America more vulnerable to pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="1206135f-df01-4c28-af6f-cf512132018d"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Government funding cuts to mRNA vaccine technology are like "losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet," Osterholm said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: SOPA Images via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c2b7ca87-15a3-4a31-a755-10dba3a1fd3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: To push the point on mRNA: Do you see its main advantage being the speed of vaccine production?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;What's important here with mRNA technology is in fact the speed, and you nailed that. Both in terms of not only designing the vaccine, but making it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing about it, though, is because of the way you can insert specific antigens into these vaccines [proteins that look foreign to the immune system]. You can take any one piece or several pieces, and actually now there's work going on on multiple antigens into mRNA vaccine, and that would be even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's much easier [than conventional vaccine manufacturing]. It's like a plug-and-play. Before, we didn't have anything like that. And clearly, we've demonstrated the mRNA approach does cause the human immune system to respond just as we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You also spend a lot of time in the book on the topic of communications — namely, how to better communicate key information in an unfolding pandemic. What do you think is a central takeaway for communicators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Science is not truth; science is the pursuit of truth. So expect that we're going to learn a lot over the course of time. And I wish I could say to you today what I'll know three years from now, but I'm not. So the best I can do is keep you informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I wrote an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;op-ed piece in the Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic response before lockdowns even got going and I urged not to do lockdowns. "They won't work, don't do them. When are you going to release the lockdown, because this is going to last for months to years?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I suggested was something more akin to a snow day. The most important thing we could do to minimize the number of severe illnesses and deaths was to keep our health care system functioning and to be able to provide that care. Well, we didn't do that well because we have these big bursts of cases. What if we had really had the data on hospital capacity in every community, and we put those numbers up every day? And when we approached, you know, 95% of beds full: "Please, just like we do for snow days, for the next week, if you can back off public interaction, we can get those bed numbers back down." We were in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should have done a much better job of communicating that and not just jumping to "lockdowns" because when they ended, then what the hell do you do? We didn't paint this as, "This is going to be a battle for potentially three or four years." We were approaching this far too much like a hurricane situation. "It's going to blow through, it's going to be horrible, but in six hours, 12 hours, we'll be able to get to recovery mode." This wasn't going to happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of things I find, throughout my 50 years in the business, is that people want truth. Don't sugarcoat things. At the same time, don't exaggerate; give people the reason as to how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Given how complicated our information ecosystem is now, I'm not sure if you have an impression of where most people got their updates? Or if it was highly mixed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that's a very important point. And I would say that no one's talking about having one single unified voice, because there's going to be differences when you're pursuing [solutions] and they'll change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where we needed more humility. I keep coming back to that word humility — to say what we know and what we don't know and how it could change. I think had we done that, we'd be in much better shape in terms of public credibility. When you don't know, say you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You close the book noting that you're often asked what the average person can do. Is there anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Actually this has come into sharper focus with regard to the vaccine issue right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our website, for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;when I do the podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we in the show notes list organizations that are working in the community on vaccines and to help support availability, education, etc. Get engaged with them. One of the things we didn't do is use our citizen public health army during the pandemic that we could have. There were some limited outreaches, for example, to the religious, to pastors and so forth, but I think we could do much, much more. Information will not stop the pandemic, but information may minimize the horrible impact that it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="05c9bcae-ba28-4f0d-bb2e-10eb96132bb8"&gt;When I talk about citizen involvement, they can't go and make vaccines, but they can surely reach out to their elected officials. They can make sure that [harmful] policies are not being made at school boards, or at city councils or in state legislatures. We just had a bill introduced in Minnesota that's starting to get some legs to it, that would &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outlaw mRNA technology as a criminal activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Literally, if you gave a vaccine, you could go to prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having citizens be able to track this, maintain contact and be able to testify I think is really important. … We have to do more and more, to have citizen watch groups that are alerting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIP [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative aimed at safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S.] is a good example of this. One of the individuals who presented yesterday at our big meeting is a woman with three kids, who is a mother, a department chief, all these different things — I don't know which 29 hours a day she works, but she's amazing. I said to her, "You know, you've got to take some time off." And she said, "This is too important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what's giving me hope, you know. That's what we have to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5a8b052e-90a8-4b73-9824-3af034c4c713" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2eis0042t1ktjno3svcg@published"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/rfk-robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-bill-cassidy.html"&gt;U.S. senators spent three hours in a hearing room&lt;/a&gt; grappling with an urgent problem. The problem is that even though most Americans trust vaccines and feel safer when they and their families have access to them, the Trump appointee in charge of distributing America’s shots has his doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2rsk000o3b7a899l0dvz@published"&gt;This hearing was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be about the president’s plan to “make America healthy again.” But for Democrats, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s actions as the secretary of Health and Human Services changed the agenda. We’ve known from the beginning, of course, how Robert F. Kennedy &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; about vaccines. But it’s worth talking about what he’s &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. So far, he has fired members of a crucial vaccine advisory committee—something he promised senators he would not do. His Food and Drug Administration has tried to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html"&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt; who can get COVID shots this fall. The secretary booted the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after a disagreement over immunization practices. Then, more than 1,000 government scientists demanded Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2rxa000p3b7axu14l6z2@published"&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/WNTranscript982025"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of What Next, Mary Harris spoke to Apoorva Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter at the New York Times, about how RFK Jr. put himself between Americans and their vaccines. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3b3o00193b7axy5d7gbg@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Harris: Some of the former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices who were fired talked to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/04/cdc-vaccine-policy-acip-covid-choice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and they said Americans are losing the ability to choose vaccination. I thought that was an interesting way of phrasing things, because it’s not like your vaccine is being taken away. It’s your choice to have a vaccine. Can you just lay out how this is working? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv38xa000z3b7axlkmpv57@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apoorva Mandavilli: &lt;/strong&gt;Their word choice, “choose to,” is also very important because that’s what RFK Jr. has always said. He wants to give Americans a choice, and he believes they should be able to choose whether they want a vaccine or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3cvt001j3b7aic5luyjv@published"&gt;But the FDA said from the start, as soon as the new leaders came on board, that they were not going to approve vaccines for anybody under 65 without new evidence. And sure enough, that is what has happened. They have approved the vaccine only for people who are older than 65 or for some people who have other health conditions that may put them at high risk. They’re not approving them for healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3fv7001t3b7avv9re3nn@published"&gt;RFK Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc#:~:text=All%20Things%20Considered-,CDC%20to%20stop%20recommending%20COVID%20vaccine%20for%20kids%2C%20pregnant%20women,pregnant%20women%20and%20healthy%20children."&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; in May that the CDC would no longer recommend the vaccines also means that insurance companies won’t cover them. So now you have a situation where, let’s say, there is a 50-year-old person who does not have any health conditions but wants to get the vaccine because they believe in it, and maybe they don’t want to expose anyone else to it. Maybe they want it because the vaccine does provide benefits, and they don’t want to get sick, or they don’t want to end up in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3l8n00233b7aa2ow7vw1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we look at the example of the COVID vaccine, how is policy trickling down to actual access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These people will not be able to get the vaccine without finding a doctor who is willing to do that for them off-label, and they might have to pay for it out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4s2e002d3b7anawztfhy@published"&gt;Some pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, give out tons of shots for adults. They’re actually now saying that they won’t carry the COVID vaccine at all in certain states because of what’s going on. Even in states where you are, in theory, able to get it, the reality is that when you have these kinds of rules, pharmacies are just reluctant to carry the vaccine. They don’t want to get involved in this kind of thing because it’s just too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4tpg002n3b7ad5og6b46@published"&gt;RFK Jr. has also threatened doctors who go against the guidelines, saying that they will not be protected from liability if they don’t follow ACIP recommendations. That’s a real deterrent for any doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4vif002x3b7avfdffbds@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it compare to policies worldwide? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4wy400373b7ak3w13rse@published"&gt;One thing that a lot of the COVID vaccine skeptics point to is that the guidelines now are closer to what they are in other countries. Of course, they very conveniently leave out the fact that in those countries, the vaccine is still approved for everyone. So they do actually have a real choice. They can still get it if they want. And many of these countries have national health care. So they’re not worried about the cost for themselves if they want the vaccine. The circumstances are very different, partly because they have a safety net. They have a health care network that takes care of them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4yqp003h3b7apfpvb15u@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week, Florida came out and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/search?q=florida+rids+vaccine+mandate&amp;amp;oq=florida+rids+vaccine+mandate&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIHCAQQIRiPAtIBCDMzNDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it will no longer require vaccines to participate in public life, whether that means going to school or whatever else. This is striking because vaccine mandates have been around for a long time and have been controversial for a long time. But they’re definitely a tool of public health to keep all kinds of people safe. So when you heard about what was happening in Florida, what was your reaction? And can you tell that story a little bit? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv51jr003r3b7a7ooso5h6@published"&gt;Florida has a surgeon general who has been very anti-vaccine for quite a while now. He has said many, many things about COVID vaccines that are not true. Even when there was a measles outbreak, he said that kids could come into school without being vaccinated. It’s not surprising that states are starting to go their own way. States have always decided for themselves what to do with various health policies. But what has been important for them is to have this central voice, the CDC, saying, “This is what we think is right,” and then they can just follow that. Maybe they make minor tweaks here and there, but they essentially follow that.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcvtb1d0007357bhacxymmn@published"&gt;But when you have a situation where they can no longer trust what’s coming from the federal government, then they are sort of forced to make their own decisions at a whole other level, where they have to actually review the evidence themselves or entrust their own judgment in a way that they haven’t had to. That’s when you see Florida saying, “Well, I’m trusting my judgment and I don’t think anybody needs to be vaccinated to come to school.” But you’re also seeing West Coast states—Washington, Oregon, and California—saying they’re going to review the evidence on their own. We’re hearing about Northeast states doing that. New York is apparently going to follow its own thing. So this mishmash was predictable when the CDC stops being the central voice that they all listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5cw700413b7ark9l421t@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next week, when ACIP meets, are they going to give further guidance? And how do you think their guidance is going to be viewed, given the fact that RFK Jr. just showed up on the Hill and got beaten about the head by senators? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5f34004b3b7aass7a1pq@published"&gt;Insurance companies are still going to cover what ACIP recommends. And there are many states whose state-level recommendations are very tied up with ACIP. Their laws will say that they follow the ACIP guidelines pretty much as they are. So for anybody to break with those recommendations, it would require some work.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5h5o004l3b7acy6vtilw@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wonder if we’re going to see a future where people travel to get vaccines, where one state looks very different than another state, and what that will mean, because of course, we’re all interconnected. States border each other. And so an outbreak in one place doesn’t necessarily stay in one place, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5j6k004v3b7awnsjdms3@published"&gt;It doesn’t at all. It doesn’t stay in one state, in one country. The thing to remember also is that a lot of the money that state health departments have comes from the CDC. So when that budget is cut, which it has been, they have less money. And they have had to lay people off. So at the same time that they’re being asked to make more decisions on their own, or they’re having to make decisions on their own, they have fewer people to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5kjm00553b7av146xm20@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines are all about prevention, and you don’t see the benefit of them for a really long time. You’re preventing a negative. So when an outbreak does happen, it may happen years after the vaccines are no longer available. Would it then be harder to draw the connection of why it happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5m3r005f3b7akkluc786@published"&gt;Yeah. Something public health people say a lot is, “When we’re doing our job right, you don’t see us.” So when we start to see more measles outbreaks, or polio, that’s when it’ll become clear what was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5nj3005p3b7ali31wz9t@published"&gt;It’ll also become clearer how intricate this network is. Things go across states, across countries. So you can’t dismantle global health, and you can’t dismantle federal health structures, and still expect things to function OK at the local level. That’s just not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5otw005z3b7aeopzhwxe@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’ve spoken to people about what happens now, is there anyone who has a vision for how to get out of the mess that we’re in with vaccines at this moment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5qxc00693b7afevqipke@published"&gt;One hard solution that I think has some hope of working, at least to some extent, is that there are medical organizations that are banding together. They are forming a coalition, of sorts, to issue guidance. Essentially, they’re forming a shadow ACIP. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are two of the organizations that are really important here. They have both said that they don’t agree with the ACIP recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5soa006j3b7amtu6wqi0@published"&gt;One hope is that there are enough of these organizations that are respected, that they will band together and that states will be able to look to them for guidance. Of course, it still won’t solve the issue of insurance coverage. But that’s the best we can look at, at this point. And there are many efforts along those &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The suspension was effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Through his attorney, Kealy denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Kealy worked at an Austin location of Lone Star Circle of Care, which is a federally qualified health center.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckmaja001u26qc1qvhccbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children ages 6 to 12 are experiencing a dramatic increase in instances of self-harm –– and they are using common items available around the house, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a00083b6n5q2w5rc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rate of instances reported to poison control centers of children being exposed to substances has risen by more than 50% since 2000, said study coauthor Dr. Hannah Hays, chief of toxicology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and medical director of the Central Ohio Poison Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a00093b6npkrfu3k9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the number of those cases with suspected suicide or self-harm intent increased up to fourfold, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000a3b6nbjgt5om3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These cases were far more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization for these children,” Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000b3b6nbdy368bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hays said she noticed seeing more and younger kids experiencing self-harm and suicidality, and she wanted to understand whether there was a real trend borne out in the data. To investigate, researchers analyzed more than 1.5 million reports of substance exposures to US poison control centers across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000c3b6nfv449lyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reports to poison control with suspected self-harm intent among 11-year-olds increased by 398% since 2000. The increase was 343% in 12-year-olds, according to the study &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-069753/203713/Poison-Center-Calls-About-Self-Harm-or-Suicidal" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday by Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000d3b6npxpuvi5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The substances in the reports included common household products such as pain relievers, antihistamines, cold medicines and vitamins, the study said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000e3b6ny1j7v1zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have analyzed data about toddlers accidentally ingesting medications and teenagers taking them for harm or recreational purposes, but this study offers important data on the ages in between, said Dr. Jennifer Hoffmann, assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University and attending physician in pediatric emergency medicine at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000f3b6n8zt1ufnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And although the data is stronger because of the large number of reports researchers analyzed, instances of ingestion are likely underreported to poison control centers — because families have to think to make the report after something bad happens, Hays said. That means the rates are likely even higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000g3b6ngbykpd83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The increases of ingestions with harmful intent are concerning, but they make sense given the rise in reports of suicidal feelings in younger kids, said psychologist Dr. Christopher Willard, a lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000h3b6n7z7q2xlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With younger kids, it’s always hard to know if they fully understand the consequences of their behaviors, and what their true intentions are,” he said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000i3b6nystx2moa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The other problem is that many homes have more poisonous substances easily available than in the past, Willard said. Those include medication, cleaning products, supplements and recreational marijuana products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000j3b6ngsfbqq81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the most important lessons to come out of the data is that families should lock away over-the-counter and prescription medications and dispose of old products safely, Hoffmann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000k3b6naatj8thk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With increased access comes increased exposures to all things,” Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000l3b6nbq46et01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision-making and planning part of the brain doesn’t develop until a person is in their mid-20s, so if kids can access potentially harmful medications, they may make an impulsive choice without fully thinking it through, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000m3b6nnonp1wq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Policymakers can have an impact on access by limiting package sizes for high-risk drugs and expanding the use of blister packages that require a person to pop out each pill individually, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000n3b6npaf4bpmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just those few minutes to pop the pills out of the blister pack can be enough to make a child think about what they’re doing, stop, and it can therefore save their life,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000o3b6nxjqkpjqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health care providers can also make a difference by screening for suicide risk and doing routine mental health checks, Hoffmann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000p3b6n02gxu78n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And families need to know what to look for, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000q3b6n81s2u55f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children don’t always look at you and say, ‘I’m feeling depressed. I’m feeling like I want to harm myself,’” she said. “Parents can look for changes in their children.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000r3b6nm5awdp1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signs that something is wrong can include changes in mood, like increased irritability, hopelessness or tearfulness. Changes in behavior such as refusing to go to school and body cues like headaches, sleep or appetite changes can also be a signal to investigate, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000s3b6nzwu9q55u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If your gut says something’s off, the next best step would be to ask kids directly,” she said. “Then go from there by looping in your safety nets, your school, your counselors, your pediatrician, to make safety plans and get concrete directions on next best steps.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000t3b6nuoa8utjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suicide in children is often an impulsive act precipitated by a stressful event, yet many reports show cases of children without a known mental health condition, Hoffmann said. That means there needs to be more universal prevention efforts, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000u3b6ns4c0rvy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

This exacerbates nerve cell death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron levels are typically measured in the brain post-mortem by analyzing brain tissue samples, but QSM allows scientists to measure the mineral non-invasively while a patient is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers looked at QSM MRI data from 158 cognitively unimpaired patients and established baseline readings for iron for each subject. Then, the scientists followed participants for 7.7 years, collecting updated readings throughout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Findings revealed that higher levels of brain iron in the initial readings, especially in the brain regions important to memory and other cognitive function, were linked to an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 7million Americans, is caused by the abnormal build-up of proteins in and around brain cells. And previous research has linked abnormally high levels of iron in the brain (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a transitional stage preceding Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say that their findings provide further evidence of QSM being a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's Disease, detecting abnormal iron accumulation in the brain linked to disease progression before people start to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will allow for earlier detection and targeted intervention for the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There isn't a single 'normal' brain iron level, as iron distribution varies across brain regions and increases with age, but typical ranges exist for specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there is no cure for dementia or Alzheimer's but the team behind the new study say that&lt;span&gt; clinical trials could test iron-targeted therapies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, the study's senior author and associate professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University Dr Xu Li said: 'QSM can detect small differences in iron levels across different brain regions, providing a reliable and non-invasive way to map and quantify iron in patients, which is not possible with conventional MR approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Using QSM, we found higher brain iron in some memory related regions that are linked to a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and faster cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We can use this kind of tool to help identify patients at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and potentially guide early interventions as new treatments become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Also, besides serving as a biomarker, brain iron may become a future therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, we hope to make the QSM technology more standardized, faster and more widely accessible in clinical practice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in Radiology, a journal of the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.rsna.org/journal/radiology"&gt;Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High levels of iron were first reported in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease in 1953 in a postmortem study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Natalie Ive (pictured) was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a type of frontotemporal dementia, in 2021 at age 48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gemma Illingworth, from Manchester, was 28-years-old when she was diagnosed with a rare form of dementia called posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). She died three years later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is a prevalent element in the human body and is needed for major biochemical processes such as oxygen transport and DNA synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The human body obtains iron through various foods, with red meat being one of the best sources, and it is absorbed through the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important to maintain a delicate balance of iron in the brain; both deficiency and overload can be detrimental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abnormal iron accumulation has been reported in numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, but it's unclear if increased iron deposition contributes to the development of these diseases or is a secondary effect or by-product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have identified that iron accumulation correlates with amyloid beta – the protein that clumps together in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These clumps form 'plaques' that collect between neurons, otherwise known as nerve cells, and disrupt cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Associations have also been found between iron and neurofibrillary tangles – abnormal accumulations of a protein called tau that collect inside neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tangles block the neuron's transport system, which harms the communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brain maps of healthy control participants and participants with Alzheimer disease. Iron accumulation was associated with cognitive deterioration independently of brain volume loss. (Alzheimer's disease is associated with higher rates of brain tissue loss than normal ageing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is known that deep grey matter structures of patients with Alzheimer's disease contain higher brain iron concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grey matter of the brain is high in neural cell bodies and plays a major part in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But less is known about the neocortex, the deeply grooved outer layer of the brain that is involved with language, conscious thought and other important functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Impaired iron stability for people with Alzheimer's disease indicates that iron chelation therapy, giving patients drugs that rid the body of iron via urine, in clinical trials might be a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpcv0d00bb9bm7lwu7jsqk@published"&gt;Shana used to love training for triathlons. As a nurse working in the ICU of the University of Chicago Medical Center, she’d often finish a night shift at 7 a.m. and then squeeze in a run on the lake before heading to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphari001r3b79c5e52dvd@published"&gt;She even completed the infamous Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon—a 1.5-mile swim from Alcatraz Island to the shoreline, an 18-mile hilly bike ride, and an 8-mile run. She’d had asthma since she was a child, but it rarely interfered with her training, usually only flaring up once a year when she had a cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphari001s3b79et42jtff@published"&gt;Then her asthma suddenly worsened. One night on the ward, she had a bad attack. She recovered, but had another the next day. And the next. Soon she was nebulizing her medication throughout the day and struggling to walk up stairs. Her doctor put her on heavy doses of steroids to try to calm her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001t3b79peu9edfj@published"&gt;She finally found relief, but it was short-lived. She gained so much weight from the steroids so rapidly—almost 60 pounds in a month—that she had a hard time moving. “Imagine going to the gym, picking up a barbell, and stacking on 60 pounds of plates, then carrying that around with you all day. In the shower, walking down the street, lying in bed. It was horrible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001u3b79penjo9hl@published"&gt;As a nurse, she understood the physiology behind what was happening to her. She knew her throbbing knees and elbows meant fluid was leaking out of her joints. She understood that the pain in her chest was her diaphragm muscle being stretched away from the bone underneath as fluid filled her abdominal wall. And as her face started to swell, she looked in the mirror and recognized the moon face that is a hallmark of Cushing’s syndrome, a condition that happens when your body has too much cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001v3b79swm1bdjs@published"&gt;Shana and I met in an online support group. We both have severe asthma, which 8 percent to 10 percent of asthmatics develop: The condition suddenly worsens without a clear reason and stops responding to most medications. Like many patients with severe asthma, we both developed adrenal diseases after having to take huge doses of steroids to manage our frequent attacks. Unlike Shana, I never developed Cushing’s syndrome, which is when your cortisol is too high. Instead, I developed adrenal insufficiency, which is when your cortisol is too low. I can no longer make cortisol on my own and must now take a synthetic form called hydrocortisone several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphark001w3b797gt57420@published"&gt;Fortunately, true disorders of cortisol like Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal insufficiency are incredibly rare: According to the Cleveland Clinic, 40–70 people in 1 million have cortisol that is too high and 100–140 people in 1 million have cortisol that is too low. This rarity is why Shana and I, and many members of our support group, are baffled by the “high cortisol” posts flooding social media, and TikTok in particular, which has more than &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/round-face-viral-terms-real-diagnostic-implications-2024a1000kia?form=fpf"&gt;800 million views&lt;/a&gt; of videos tagged #CortisolTok. According to these posts, high cortisol is to blame for a slew of health issues including fatigue, a puffy face, waking up at night, and weight gain (commonly called “cortisol belly”). Many of the influencers posting about cortisol call themselves hormone or weight loss coaches, though they typically don’t have medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001x3b79hz63yd4u@published"&gt;It’s hard to overstate how essential cortisol is to our bodies. Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, was a fatal condition until hydrocortisone was invented in the 1930s. Nowadays, people with adrenal insufficiency have mostly normal lifespans. But it is still a dangerous disease that can quickly flare into an adrenal crisis, which is when your body doesn’t have enough cortisol, and your organ systems begin to fail. Some studies show that up to 1 in 4 people &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23948-adrenal-crisis"&gt;die from an adrenal crisis&lt;/a&gt;, a tragic reality Shana and I see all too often in our support group.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001y3b79wuc8o9no@published"&gt;You wouldn’t know that sad truth from the posts that tend to prescribe the standard wellness remedies of the moment: matcha tea, bone broth, celery juice, and cold plunges. Some are even pricier, like a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNp4XWrOzrT/"&gt;$184 weighted pillow&lt;/a&gt; that promises to help you “say goodbye to cortisol” and a $1,000 &lt;a href="https://yourhealthcoachbiz.com/3-month-cortisol-recovery-program-rachel-feldman/"&gt;three-month online “cortisol recovery” program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001z3b79ok2nyexk@published"&gt;Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, two tiny organs, each the size of half a walnut, that sit on top of the kidneys. It regulates our blood pressure, helps us digest food, keeps our blood sugar stable, and controls our circadian rhythm. Cortisol is also critical to our immune system. It repairs tissues and acts as our body’s most powerful anti-inflammatory, which is why Shana’s doctor gave her such high doses of steroids—synthetic cortisol—to treat her asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00203b79jq7vh4g3@published"&gt;Perhaps the biggest danger of this trend is that people are panicking about their cortisol for no reason. Dr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, an endocrinologist at the NYU School of Medicine, has seen a surge in patients requesting cortisol tests in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00213b794xf4fc0p@published"&gt;One of her first priorities is to help her patients understand that cortisol not only fluctuates throughout the day, but is different on a day-to-day basis. Our cortisol peaks around 8 a.m. and then falls throughout the rest of the day, increasing in little bumps when we eat, drink coffee, or feel stress. It increases with bad stress like a difficult meeting or a stomach bug, as well as good stress like a family reunion or a birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="16" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00223b79mevq8bsv@published"&gt;“But those bumps are almost always transient and quickly go back to a baseline,” Pessah-Pollack says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00233b79hrzvzdsm@published"&gt;That is why she emphasizes to her patients that cortisol testing needs to be handled and interpreted by specialists. Otherwise, if they use saliva tests at home, as is commonly encouraged on TikTok, they might be unnecessarily spooked when they see their cortisol is all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00243b79fuqy7lqs@published"&gt;Pessah-Pollack is deeply empathetic to her patients’ concerns and tries to get to the root cause of why they’re worried their cortisol is too high. Many of her patients say it’s because they are exhausted or have gained weight. These are two common features of an underactive thyroid, a condition that is thousands of times more common than cortisol disorders, which is why one of her first steps is typically to order blood work to check their thyroid function.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00253b79s8pd8x74@published"&gt;If they’re waking up at night, she considers other factors like whether they may have undiagnosed sleep apnea or are drinking alcohol shortly before bedtime. And if they’re worried about weight gain, she helps them analyze their activity level and how their exercise and nutrition needs may be changing with age. Unless she sees the telltale signs of Cushing’s, like stretchmarks on a patient’s thighs and stomach, central obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar, she doesn’t worry that their cortisol is too high.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00263b79v5mh6epk@published"&gt;So, how did cortisol get so misunderstood?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00273b79d2x8w5ct@published"&gt;Cortisol took off as a buzzword associated with stress after the publication of naturopath James Lee Wilson’s 2001 book, &lt;em&gt;Adrenal Fatigue: The 21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; Century Stress Syndrome&lt;/em&gt;. In the book, Wilson argued chronic stress damages the adrenal glands, which means a lot of people don’t have enough cortisol and feel exhausted and foggy as a result. He coined this condition “adrenal fatigue,” and although it is not a recognized medical diagnosis, it became popular in wellness communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp00283b79nbcg3mzf@published"&gt;For years, Google search trends show about equal interest in low and high cortisol. Then, in 2022, searches for “high cortisol” skyrocketed. Around that time, several studies came out linking stress about the COVID-19 pandemic with increased levels of cortisol in health care workers and the general population. Perhaps this contributed to the sudden spike of interest in high cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp00293b79xjpw67lt@published"&gt;It makes sense that this interest has endured. Who &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; need a word to describe the constant panic many of us feel in today’s world, where we are constantly bombarded with anxiety-provoking headlines about climate change, A.I. taking over jobs, and unstable democracies? How could we not be seduced by the hope that an allegedly cortisol-lowering matcha tea or magnesium footbath might quiet our inner turmoil?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002a3b79vsc7duzw@published"&gt;But cortisol is not a synonym for stress. It is a hormone we need to survive. And this misunderstanding is deeply frustrating to people with adrenal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002b3b79cspf1p99@published"&gt;When I asked my support group what they wished people knew about cortisol, one woman said she wished people knew how similar Addison’s disease is to Type 1 diabetes, and that if she doesn’t take medication daily, she will die. Another said she wished her friends and family would stop telling her how lucky she is that she can’t make cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002c3b79lszfem65@published"&gt;Shana recently switched to a lower dose of a gentler steroid, and her doctor says her Cushing’s should be gone within the year. Her face is still swollen, however, and she is growing weary of posts about “cortisol face.” She’s seen many reasons people have puffy faces in her line of work: too much salt in their diet, alcohol, allergies, even sleeping face down. She hopes that by sharing her story, she can encourage people who are experiencing any unusual symptoms and are worried about their cortisol to seek medical care instead of trying remedies they find online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharq002d3b79acwpi8w9@published"&gt;She’s already dreaming of her next triathlon, perhaps the Alpe d’Huez in the French Alps. Yesterday she ran 200 yards. She hopes to run a little farther &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

recommends that adults should be active everyday and undertake at least 150 minutes of moderately intense activity or 75 minutes if vigorous activity a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as we age, muscle mass gradually deteriorates, and joints become stiffer and weaker over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat this, the health service also recommends strengthening exercises that work all major muscle groups including the legs, back and abdomen at least two days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now Fikri Fikriev, a physiotherapist at Physiotherapy Matters has shared four simple exercises to implement in midlife to make ageing easier, reducing back pain and supporting muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As we age, naturally the joints can become stiffer and our muscles lose strength,' he told the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/people-aged-30s-40s-should-35863189"&gt;Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The rate of muscle mass loss depends on age and lifestyle, but we gradually begin to lose muscle mass from around our 30-40s.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have previously shown that vigorous activity — such as running, swimming or tennis — at least once a week is needed to ward off musculoskeletal pain in the long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From around 65-years-old, this process can speed up––in some cases reaching around 8 per cent muscle mass per decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Fikriev added: 'This can have an effect on your mobility and energy levels, hence why it is essential to have a balanced routine that helps to preserve strength and mobility as we age.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To do this and ease the effects of ageing, Mr Fikriev shared four simple exercises to perform around three to four times a week in midlife for maximum health benefits, stressing that 'consistency is key'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Two leg bridge &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This straightforward exercise is an easy way to ease back pain, whilst building core stability which helps with everything from posture to bladder control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To perform the exercise simply lie on your back with your knees bent and feet firmly planted on the ground, hip-width apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Push your hips towards the sky to form a bridge shape with your body, making sure to push down through your heels and being careful to keep your tailbone tucked in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bridge exercises and hip thrusts can improve back pain, as well as hip, hamstring and glute strength,' Mr Fikriev explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, bridge exercises can help strengthen the core and pelvic floor. This is very important, especially in women who struggle with bladder control, such as older adults, after pregnancy, or due to stress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This exercise can also be modified for more of a challenge, with the option to incorporate weights, add pulses or lift one leg as you thrust upwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glute bridges can help ease back pain and improve posture, as well as strengthening the core&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Wall push-ups &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Push up exercises are a great way to improve posture and upper body strength, such as in your back, chest and core,' the physiotherapist explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people who are just starting out on their fitness journey, a wall-push up is a great alternative to the classic exercise. Place your hands against the wall, shoulder-width apart, and bring your chest towards the wall and then push it away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For more of a burn, try and keep your elbows tucked in close to your body. As you build strength, try adding more reps or position yourself further away from the wall to build resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Push-ups also help to improve heart health, lose body weight and fat, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol', Mr Fikriev added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has long been proven that exercise strengthens the heart and lowers blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By minimising metabolic risk factors, exercising in midlife can have a preventative effect preserving muscle mass and slowing down biological ageing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These simple exercises can then be modified once you have built a good base level of core strength and mobility  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Sit to stand &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst it might sound overly simple, moving from a sitting position to standing can help strengthen muscles we rely on for everyday movement. This functional conditioning helps to keep joints flexible, reducing risk of inflammation and joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As you progress, you can also start adding in squats and lunges to increase your range of motion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Calf raises &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Calf raises offer several benefits, including improved balanced, improved ankle stability and mobility, and enhanced strength,' Mr Fikriev explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simple movement involves alternating between a tip-toe stance and being flat footed on the ground. Again, this exercise can be modified with the addition of weights, or by performing the exercise on one leg and then the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The physiotherapist added: 'This exercise can also improve lower limb blood circulation, which reduces sprains and helps prevent falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also help reduce the risk of tendonitis––where a tendon becomes inflamed causing pain and joint stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 14:35:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您应该吃的6种降低血压的方便食品- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/6-convenience-foods-eat-lower-000000368.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Katey Davidson, M.Sc.FN, RD, CPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design elements: Getty Images.

After all, it often brings to mind greasy takeout, salty snacks or sugary treats. But here’s the truth: convenience doesn’t always mean unhealthy. In fact, supporting your heart health doesn’t require hours in the kitchen—many quick and easy foods can be part of a heart-healthy diet. “Convenience foods get a bad rap, but we often underestimate how many options actually fall into this category beyond chips or doughnut holes,” says &lt;a href="https://www.artofappetite.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bree Phillips, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bree Phillips, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is choosing foods rich in nutrients that support healthy blood pressure—like fiber, potassium and magnesium—while &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:limiting sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;limiting sodium&lt;/a&gt;, which can increase blood pressure. The good news? Grocery stores are full of simple, convenient, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy options;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-healthy options&lt;/a&gt;. Here are six dietitian-approved convenience foods to add to your list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Canned Black Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great convenience food for better blood pressure is canned no-salt-added black beans,” says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re quick and ready to use, packed with potassium and magnesium—two minerals that help relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. They’re also high in fiber, which supports heart health.” If you can’t find a sodium-free version, she recommends giving them a rinse before eating to reduce any excess sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re short on time, having these in your pantry means you can have a nourishing meal in just minutes. Try tossing them into a salad for a satisfying lunch, mashing them with spices for a quick bean dip, or adding them to soups and tacos for an easy dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Steamed &amp;amp; Peeled Beets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beets are nutritional powerhouses, but preparing them from scratch can be a messy and time-consuming process. That’s why canned beets are an excellent choice. “This convenient option lets you enjoy all the benefits without any of the purple-stained fingers, making it simple to add a vibrant, earthy and healthy component to any meal. They’re such a time-saver and spare the mess of preparing fresh beets,” says &lt;a href="https://www.rachellemallik.com/meetrachelle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rachelle Mallik, M.A., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rachelle Mallik, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinaychu.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christina Chu, M.S., RD, CSSD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christina Chu, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports dietitian, points to their added nutritional benefits. “Beets contain nitrates, which convert to nitric oxide, a natural vasodilator that opens up your blood vessels, thus improving blood flow and improving blood pressure,” she explains. Steamed beets are also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11369/healthy-recipes-for-potassium-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good source of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good source of potassium&lt;/a&gt; and folate, both of which contribute to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them into a salad with goat cheese and walnuts, blend them into a smoothie for a nutrient boost, or simply enjoy them as a side dish drizzled with a little balsamic glaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Canned Tuna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Canned tuna with no salt added can be a great choice for someone looking to regulate their blood pressure,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Not only is it low in sodium, but it is a lean source of protein and high in omega-3s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omega-3 fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; are celebrated for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support overall heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;support overall heart health&lt;/a&gt;, including managing healthy blood pressure. Studies suggest that they help blood vessels relax and improve how they function, which reduces strain on the heart and arteries. Tuna also contains selenium, a trace mineral linked with better blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try adding canned tuna on top of a salad, in a sandwich or in a delicious pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Frozen Cooked Edamame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found in the freezer aisle, edamame is one of the most underrated convenience foods. These green soybeans are “loaded with plant protein, potassium, isoflavones (plant compounds) and fiber; all components that support healthy blood pressure levels,” explains &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com/contact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, studies have found that eating soybeans and soy products is associated with lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a bag in your freezer and steam them for a simple side dish, toss them into stir-fries or salads for extra protein, or puree them with garlic and lemon juice to make a nutritious dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Plain Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping a container of plain strained (Greek-style) yogurt in your fridge is a convenient way to boost nutrition at any meal. It’s thicker and higher in protein than regular yogurt, providing a satisfying base for countless creations. It’s also linked with better blood pressure, thanks to its quality protein and nutrients like potassium, magnesium and calcium that help support healthy blood vessels and flush out excess sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high protein content can also aid in weight management, which is another key factor in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:maintaining healthy blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;maintaining healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it as a base for a heart-healthy parfait with berries and nuts, as a healthier substitute for sour cream on baked potatoes, or as a creamy foundation for sauces and dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Prewashed Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating more vegetables rich in natural nitrates, like leafy greens, is linked to lower blood pressure. They’re also rich in potassium, magnesium and an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:array of antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;array of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; like lutein that support heart health. In fact, one study found that a greater intake of leafy greens is associated with lower blood pressure and a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduced risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While salad kits can sometimes come with high-sodium dressings, a simple bag of prewashed spinach, kale or arugula offers pure convenience. These greens are ready to use right out of the bag, cutting down on prep time and making it incredibly easy to add to any meal. Use these greens in salads, soups, sauces, smoothies or sandwiches to easily boost your nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting a diet that supports healthy blood pressure doesn’t have to mean an expensive grocery list or a complicated meal plan. Simple changes and smart choices can make a big difference. By including &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-and-ultra-processed-foods-dietitian-approved-11770154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrient-rich convenience foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;nutrient-rich convenience foods&lt;/a&gt; like the ones on this list, you can build &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; without adding stress to your busy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that you don’t have to buy everything at once or completely overhaul your diet. Start by adding one or two items to your weekly routine—swap a salty snack for edamame, or replace a complicated side dish with some steamed beets. Small, easy adjustments like these let you take control of your health one delicious meal at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-convenience-foods-to-lower-blood-pressure-11801985" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 14:19:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBjRjdpUE9kd0hyTmJ5TkpIZ0wxekV4dE9UWXQ5VUJQMGpOUnZ1X1c1Z0ZPTEdRNXl2T29kdmFCNDI4WmVYb0doVTI4MzlIU0k2U09LSkV1R2xKZXA2QU9vUW9odmVIRGEzbjJ4MVV5d2pVdw</guid></item><item><title>Parkview遗传学项目现已向公众开放- WINE 15</title><link>https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/parkview-genetics-program-now-open-to-the-public/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) – A program that until now has only been available for Parkview Health patients and staff is opening to anyone interested in knowing their genetic health risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DNA Insights, a free community health research program, is now available to anyone ages 18 and older with a Parkview MyChart account. Created in partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.parkview.com/news/results/01152025-parkview-health-joins-helix-research-network-to-advance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Helix Research Network&lt;/a&gt;, the program aims to help participants understand how their ancestry has impacted their traits and risk of certain diseases, according to a press release from Parkview. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who enroll will take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="hfzyf2ay" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete an online informed consent form&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Visit a Parkview laboratory for a simple blood draw&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Receive no-cost genetic screening to learn about their inherited risk for:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain hereditary cancers, including breast, ovarian and colorectal.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A hereditary form of high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia) that increases risk for heart attack and stroke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gain insights into regional ancestry and selected genetic traits, such as caffeine sensitivity and sleep patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1-2% of program participants are expected to have a genetic variant that may put them at risk for one of the above conditions. According to the press release, those with positive results are offered a no-cost genetic counseling session with a Parkview counselor to understand their results and discuss proactive, preventative care planning. Results may also help guide testing for other family members who could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="hfzyf2ay" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Integrating genetic information into everyday care is the future of medicine,” said Dr. Michael Mirro, chief academic research officer for Parkview Health. “Our goal is to make precision health accessible to more people, which in turn will help us design smarter, more effective programs for prevention and treatment across our region.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over the next several years, Parkview aims to enroll 100,000 participants in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you’re at a routine checkup and you’re wondering if you should ask your doctor for the shots; maybe the pediatric clinic is running a vaccine clinic and you’re considering stopping by with the whole family. Either way, it has become a routine part of every autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this year, it’s different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Any parent who reads the news or logs onto social media has probably heard that the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted"&gt;US government has changed its vaccine guidance&lt;/a&gt;. They may also have learned that some of the leading doctor organizations in the country &lt;a href="/health/459226/rfk-jr-trump-covid-vaccine-ban"&gt;are &lt;em&gt;opposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to those changes, as are a growing number of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I am lucky to have three healthy children under age 7, but I have still found myself wondering particularly about the value of Covid-19 shots for them the past few years. Like many parents, I have a lot of questions: &lt;em&gt;Is the government going to change what vaccines we can get? Are Covid and flu shots going to be accessible anymore? Will they be covered by health insurance? How do I even know anymore which vaccines are safe for my child?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It used to be simple: The federal government, professional medical societies, your personal physician would all tell you the same thing about which vaccines you should get. And then your health insurance company — following that guidance — would usually cover the cost. But perhaps not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the US health secretary, is making a lot of changes to the government’s vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He has unilaterally &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/27/covid-vaccine-2025-fda-recommendation-rfk"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that healthy children and healthy pregnant women should not receive a dose of the Covid vaccines — a move that has spurred uproar among staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and &lt;a href="/health/459768/trump-cdc-director-monarez-robert-kennedy-jr"&gt;led to an exodus of its leaders&lt;/a&gt;, including director Susan Monarez. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-and-robert-f-kennedy-junior-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-within-months/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration may pull the Covid vaccines from the market entirely. He has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5445254/cdc-review-vaccine-schedule-children"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; a review of all of the vaccines that children receive when they’re growing up, and Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/03/kennedy-prepares-to-name-new-acip-members-00542750"&gt;put vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt; in important positions in the administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, the medical establishment has started pushing back forcefully. In the past few weeks, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/leading-pediatrics-group-recommends-covid-19-shots-for-young-children-differing-from-cdc-5ed971a6?mod=djemHL_t"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/ob-gyns-clash-with-rfk-jr-to-back-covid-shots-during-pregnancy?cmpid=BBD082525_prognosis&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=250825&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prognosis&amp;amp;embedded-checkout=true"&gt;American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; have said that children and pregnant women should receive the Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is a group of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;infectious disease experts at the University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; who are working on alternative vaccine recommendations, in consultation with a range of medical organizations. Groups of states &lt;a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/09/03/vaccines-oregon-washington-california-cdc/"&gt;on the West Coast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/metro/vaccine-public-health-massachusetts-pennsylvania-rhode-island-vermont-connecticut-maine-kennedy-trump/"&gt;across New England&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up with their neighbors to potentially issue their own vaccine recommendations. &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/04/metro/covid-vaccines-kennedy-cdc-healey/"&gt;Massachusetts will require health insurers&lt;/a&gt; to cover state-endorsed vaccines, and more states may follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are some essential things to know about where vaccine access stands right now: The Trump administration has granted more limited approval for the latest update of the Covid shots. Healthy adults under 65 and children are not technically covered by the new Food and Drug Administration approval, and it’s not clear how widely available the vaccines will be at pharmacies and doctors offices in the fall. And the CDC will release its own recommendations for the Covid vaccines later in September, which could match the FDA approval — but could not. We’re in uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So far, other vaccines have not yet been affected, but we have already seen Kennedy make changes to the vaccine guidance outside of the normal process. The government could still make changes to who is recommended to get flu shots and RSV shots, and, in the long term, they could change the recommendations around measles shots, hepatitis shots, and all of the other vaccines that make up the childhood immunization schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And in this new normal, where the government and medical establishment are at odds, whenever Kennedy walks back a recommendation for a specific vaccine, professional medical organizations may recommend the exact opposite. So, what are parents, trying to do the best for their children, supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, know which sources can help you find your bearings. Even though many experts in the public health establishment are pushing back on the federal government right now, it’s still worth understanding what the CDC recommends. You can find this &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html"&gt;on the CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;. After that, you want to get the bigger picture: Understand what the relevant professional medical societies recommend. Some of the big ones are: the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/AAP-Immunization-Schedule?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/special-topics/immunization/"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But you’re not on your own in the labyrinth of the internet, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your family physician, primary care doctor, and pharmacist will also be able to walk you through the best available information. They may also be able to tell you about any recent changes to the federal policy and what’s being communicated to the public about why they were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If both the CDC and the doctors’ groups agree on their vaccine guidance — as they might for, for example, the flu shot — then you can feel good about which shots to get, and you can be confident that your health insurance will cover it. Federal law mandates that most insurers cover the vaccines that are recommended by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But what if the CDC and the doctor groups disagree, as they seem to on the value of Covid shots at the moment? This is a situation where it is valuable to have a doctor you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unfortunately, finding a primary care doctor is &lt;a href="/23817170/family-doctor-primary-care-physician-general-practitioner-shortage"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt; than it should be in the United States. But something most families can do is pose these questions even to a nurse at a pharmacy or health care worker at a vaccine clinic, for your own knowledge and peace of mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the benefits of receiving the vaccine? What are the potential risks? How common are serious side effects?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, in their opinion, &lt;em&gt;Do the benefits outweigh the risks or vice versa? Is one vaccine preferable over the other?&lt;/em&gt; The Pfizer vaccine, for example, is approved for children ages 6 and older, while the Moderna shot is approved for kids 6 &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The next major question we’re all going to have to face is: &lt;em&gt;If I want to get a vaccine for myself or my child, will it cost me any money?&lt;/em&gt; This largely depends on your health insurance, if you have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As of today, none of the major health insurers have made significant changes to their vaccine coverage policies. But that could change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your doctor likely deals with insurance coverage in these situations all the time. Use them as an ally when trying to figure out if you can get your health insurance to cover a vaccine in a scenario where it is not federally required. They should also know about any state-level mandates that could require a health plan to cover you or your child’s shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Doctors may even be able to help you file a claim with your health insurer, and they might be aware of other public and private programs that are available to help cover the cost of vaccines. The &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-with-some-restrictions-for-kids-and-adults"&gt;new FDA approvals&lt;/a&gt; do allow for kids with underlying health conditions to receive the vaccine in consultation with a doctor, which could ensure insurance coverage. Adults may also want to ask if any of their preexisting medical conditions allow them to qualify under the new criteria. In general, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;the list of qualifying conditions&lt;/a&gt; is quite long, but it includes things like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, mental health conditions, and immunodeficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Making health care decisions might not be as easy as it used to be. But your best allies are your health care provider — and yourself. Learn as much information as you can, try to find a doctor you trust, and you can be more confident in your health care decisions for yourself and your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOZFo5REVDWHBwc2hSQVpoVnF5VFBxcGJET2VIT2NFVHpfVGRBTWdpdTZ6MFZ6RjdkNkJKNXh6WF9DN1ltRnBEbk9EQV8xd3ZDZFoxV0lzLUQyZjdWZ1RoXzk3RmV4RFVyMlRieTVxSGg0NjRBb1dXV0VqSjV5MlZ5TFNkZktzUnpCa1VXZg</guid></item><item><title>每日服用欧米茄-3补充剂对女性有什么好处- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/omega-3-benefits-for-women-11802684</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study shows that omega-3 deficiency could put women at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are important for everyone's health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize eating omega-3-rich foods whenever possible, and talk with your doctor about taking a supplement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, a family of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11686761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential fats found in foods&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds, are critical for many aspects of health. Now, a new study has found that omega-3 deficiency could put women at greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's and Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, found that women with Alzheimer’s showed a notable decrease in unsaturated lipids—especially those containing omega fatty acids—compared to healthy women and men with Alzheimer's.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This suggests there may be sex-specific differences between how Alzheimer's develops and progresses in women versus men, which may help explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with the disease, said &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/doha-ayish/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Doha Ayish, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Houston Methodist West Hospital.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also suggests that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-omega-3-than-sardines-11745099" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet rich in omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; could help protect against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Women make up almost two-thirds of people with Alzheimer’s in America, so this could be a potential breakthrough in prevention and treatment that is much needed, as Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death for Americans," said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vanessa King, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While King said more research is needed before any firm recommendations can be made about Alzheimer's specifically, research shows that there are health benefits to an omega-3-rich diet — especially for women.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning, and happy tenth anniversary to STAT! That’s a decade of incredible, award-winning journalism, wonderful colleagues, and delicious snacks shared at the office.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-next-maha-commission-report-will-publish-today"&gt;The next MAHA Commission report will publish today&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, the MAHA Commission, led by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will release its report on how to reduce chronic disease among children. It’s a long-awaited follow-up to a controversial May &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/rfk-jr-maha-commission-report-key-takeaways-ultraprocessed-foods-environmental-toxins-overmedicalization/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that contained &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/29/white-house-acknowledges-problems-rfk-jr-maha-report/"&gt;citations&lt;/a&gt; to nonexistent studies and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/20/maha-children-health-report-citations-errors-sloppy/"&gt;mis-cited&lt;/a&gt; others. We’ll have more details on the new report later today, but here’s a recap of what we know so far: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT reporters reviewed a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/15/maha-report-rfk-tiptoes-on-pesticides-ultraprocessed-foods/"&gt;leaked draft&lt;/a&gt; of the report in mid-August, which the White House referred to as “speculative literature.” That draft called for more research on familiar topics like childhood vaccine schedule reform and nutrition, largely steering clear of explicit policy recommendations. There were some surprises, including a call to look into the “potential benefits of select high-quality supplements,” as well as for research on electromagnetic radiation, which is more of a fringe concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fda-greenlights-trial-of-gene-edited-pig-kidneys"&gt;FDA greenlights trial of gene-edited pig kidneys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost three months since Bill Stewart received a kidney transplant from a pig. He’s back at home, at work, and has even been able to go e-biking on a lakeside trail with his wife, untethered to the grueling schedules of dialysis for the first time in years. He’s the latest of a small number of people who’ve gotten a kidney from a donor pig that’s been CRISPR’d to make its organs more human-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My pig kidney and I had a little conversation while I was laying there,” Stewart told STAT. “I just basically said, ‘I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that you stay healthy, and I appreciate you doing everything you can to keep me upright and breathing.’” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These experiments and others like them have proceeded through an expanded access program at the FDA that’s focused on patients with life-threatening conditions. But that’s about to change. Yesterday, eGenesis, a Cambridge-based biotechnology company, announced that it had been cleared by the FDA to begin a broader trial of kidneys from the CRISPR’d pigs. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/pig-organ-transplant-egenesis-revivicor-human-trials-fda/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from STAT’s Eric Boodman and Megan Molteni on what’s ahead.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-florida-vs-trump-vs-rfk-jr"&gt;Florida vs. Trump vs. RFK Jr.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, Florida became the first state in the country to plan to eliminate school vaccination requirements. Kennedy has a long history of opposing such mandates, and both NIH director Jay Bhattacharya and CMS administrator Mehmet Oz praised the decision out of Florida. But President Trump offered a different view. “I think we have to be very careful,” he told reporters in the White House on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s another example of the growing public divide between Trump and his health secretary over vaccines, which could threaten Kennedy’s plan to upend business as usual at the federal health agencies, especially for vaccines, STAT’s Chelsea Cirruzzo and Daniel Payne report. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/vaccine-policy-cracks-showing-between-trump-kennedy/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; on what’s at stake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, two local public health officials — one from Texas, another from Ohio — write  in a new &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/school-vaccine-requirements-florida-red-states-public-health/"&gt;First Opinion&lt;/a&gt; essay that they’re worried their states could be next to drop the mandates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seen firsthand in our communities how viruses do not respect borders,” the authors write. During the last school year, state laws exempted 3.6% of children nationwide from vaccine requirements. But in parts of Texas and Ohio, that rate is often even higher. Some Texas schools at the epicenter of the state’s measles outbreak had MMR vaccination rates under 50%. In Ohio, only 85% of kindergartners received MMR vaccines last year. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/school-vaccine-requirements-florida-red-states-public-health/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; on what public health authorities are bracing for if more states follow Florida’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-men-die-so-much-earlier-than-women"&gt;Why do men die so much earlier than women?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two principal reasons that often get cited when it comes to lower life expectancies for men are Covid-19 and “deaths of despair” such as suicide and drug overdoses. But this isn’t a new problem — government data shows that in 1921, the life expectancy at birth was 1.8 years longer for women than men. The disparity ballooned to nearly 8 years by 1979, then began falling, reaching under 5 years in 2010. By 2023, it had shot up again, at just over 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gap has myriad causes, including men’s higher smoking rates and reluctance to go to the doctor. You might notice the element of personal responsibility in those two examples. “We think about men’s health as a problem of men’s misbehavior,” population health professor Derek Griffith told STAT’s Olivia Goldhill. “We haven’t looked at the social and structural drivers, and commercial and political drivers. We have to broaden the way we think about it.” In her latest story, Olivia digs into these societal influences. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/how-research-ignores-men-dying-younger" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-promising-new-treatment-for-a-tough-cancer"&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type="bold"&gt;A promising new treatment for a tough cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Small cell lung cancer is a bleak diagnosis with a dismal survival rate. But finally, researchers might be making some progress. On Monday, BioNTech &lt;a data-stringify-link="https://cattendee.abstractsonline.com/meeting/21151/Session/243" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://cattendee.abstractsonline.com/meeting/21151/Session/243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at the World Conference on Lung Cancer some promising Phase 2 data on a novel immunotherapy that targets two key proteins, PDL1 and VEGF.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the tumors of all 43 patients either shrank or did not progress, and 76.3% of patients saw significant tumor reduction. The average amount that tumors shrank was 56.7% in the trial. “These are impressive but small numbers,” said Roy Herbst, deputy director of the Yale Cancer Center, who did not work on the study, adding that it will be key to see whether the benefits persist. “But good forward progress so far.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BioNTech presented data showing that the same treatment was also effective in treating &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/10/triple-negative-breast-cancer-biontech-immunotherapy-bispecific/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/10/triple-negative-breast-cancer-biontech-immunotherapy-bispecific/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;triple negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; last year. With the combined early successes in difficult cancer types, the company believes that the drug may be the future “&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/cancer-therapy-gold-rush-bispecific-antibodies-summit-biontech/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/cancer-therapy-gold-rush-bispecific-antibodies-summit-biontech/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;immune-oncology backbone&lt;/a&gt; across tumors,” said Özlem Türeci, the company’s cofounder and CMO. —&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt; Angus Chen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

a report by Indy100, 'Google searches have shot up to 46,000', but why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mike Tee, a senior doctor at the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.harleystreetskinclinic.com/"&gt;Harley Street Skin Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, says that around '80 percent' of patients are 'seeking an aesthetic result, rather than addressing a purely medical concern', as was the case before 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Searches for scrotox are reportedly on the rise (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are people having scrotox?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to Dr Tee, patients usually get it done for at least one of these three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;1) To reduce wrinkles or creases in the scrotal skin, making it appear smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;2) To treat hyperhidrosis (sweating of the skin) which causes discomfort or irritation from constant moisture, as well as chafing or skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;3) Temporarily increasing scrotal size or sag, because relaxing the muscles allows the scrotum to hang lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"In adult men, an overactive cremasteric muscle can cause involuntary and frequent tight contractions, which can be very painful," Dr Tee told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Once again, both physical activity and sexual activity can be affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrotox side effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Any medical procedure can have side effects (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; professional notes that 'botulinum toxin is generally safe', it's important to undergo treatment via a qualified doctor to minimise the chances of anything going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Less common, but equally as concerning side effects include asymmetry, as well as allergic reactions such as rashes and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There's also a small chance you could get anaphylaxis, consisting of urinary or sexual dysfunction if the toxin spreads too deeply, Dr Tee warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But as is the case with most cosmetic procedures, the more common issues include tenderness, sensitivity and bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the recovery like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Tee explained: "Recovery is typically quick, with most patients returning to normal daily activities immediately after treatment. There may be some tenderness and redness in the first 24 to 48 hours. I advise patients to avoid sexual activity, hot baths, or exercise during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It’s important to wear loose clothing, keep the area clean, and take general care for the following seven days. Effects will begin to appear gradually, with full results visible between two and four weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 11:04:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOOVJoSjRtQ3RGQmNoNjFIZEJ0LW40Zy1xRHVMQld2dmFTOHMyYVdaY0RZbGt4UjJPMzBPZTMwanVHTGtjRFo4bXRObVNXMFlfa0k4aTRmRDRSOTQxOWNxRzQ5WWJGazdZUjJ4Y3FCbmdIWURmY3FmZkpNdDlENmQ3Nl8zbGhKbjY2OGpISFJjamw5NnZ0WEc4ZVlITHVicVd1el9FQw</guid></item><item><title>关于新冠肺炎，医生现在最担心的是什么- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-vaccines-experts-what-to-know_l_68bb3c15e4b0a78951966045</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bb3c15e4b0a78951966045" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; is making headlines in several ways right now. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-surge-west-center-states_l_68b1c4aae4b072bf6d64617e" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Infections are up in" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bb3c15e4b0a78951966045" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68b1c4aae4b072bf6d64617e" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Infections are up in&lt;/a&gt; multiple parts of the country, and COVID vaccines are not available for many people who could get them last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is colliding with the upcoming colder weather, when more and more people will spend time — and share germs — indoors, raising fears that controlling cases will become even harder than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s chaos ― and this current state of affairs is worrying experts.

That confusion is going to lead to an increase in vaccine hesitancy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting the shot could mean someone ends up with long COVID after infection or another severe consequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There could be a big disparity in who actually has access to the vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you may need a prescription from a doctor for vaccine access in some states.

brings up the point where not everyone in this country has access to a primary care doctor where they can just go get a prescription and go to CVS or go to their doctor to get vaccinated at the office,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have so many people who just don’t have primary care doctors, who are underinsured or uninsured and can’t have access to these things,” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a divide in who has access to the vaccines, Burnett explained, which is worrisome and could cause worse health outcomes in groups that are already underinsured or uninsured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we enter cold and flu season, hospitals could deal with overcrowding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re entering cold and flu season, and our hospitals are already very, very busy,” Burnett said. “Just last month in August, hospitals were overflowing with patients, and that’s concerning because August is typically the season where we don’t have much activity in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett is worried that hospitals will be even busier during respiratory virus season as vaccine access is fragmented and there’s much confusion about who can actually get the COVID shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m already starting to see more and more ER visits,” Burnett said. “I haven’t seen too much COVID, I’m starting to see more of it now, but it’s just busy in general, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there’s so much impact from the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people got sick during COVID, a lot of which resulted in a lot of chronic illness, not just from COVID itself, but just from people having interruption in their health care,” Burnett continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Many people were afraid to leave their homes to go to doctors’ appointments during the pandemic, which allowed symptoms to worsen and left underlying conditions untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t realize that we’re still dealing with the ramifications of the pandemic and how it disrupted health care,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t at risk of severe COVID or flu, you may need to go to the hospital for another reason, such as a broken leg or a bad cut, and you might be met with long wait times because of the crowding at the hospital, Burnett explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

Clinically, PCOS is a complex endocrine condition, a combination of metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory factors; this combination can disrupt a typical workday with fatigue, foggy brain, headaches, mood swings, and sleep problems. Global experts are now beginning to recognize that PCOS is an important public health issue and not simply a fertility problem, and highlight the need for overall better management of PCOS as a part of daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="referpara"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pcos-could-lead-to-decreased-alertness-and-longer-reaction-times-study/article69622775.ece" target="_self"&gt;PCOS could lead to decreased alertness and longer reaction times: study  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does work feel harder with PCOS? One reason is insulin resistance, common in PCOS, which can cause a roller-coaster of energy and foggy thinking after high-carb meals. Chronic low-grade inflammation and androgen excess add to the drag in cognition and mood. Emerging brain-imaging and cognitive studies suggest measurable differences in attention, memory, and network connectivity in some women with PCOS, translating into the very real “I can’t focus” days at your desk. None of this means you can’t perform at a high level; it means your brain and metabolism are working against friction that most colleagues don’t feel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is another hidden culprit. There is a significantly higher likelihood that women with PCOS suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/more-than-a-snore-deconstructing-sleep-apnoea/article69328805.ece" target="_self"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)&lt;/a&gt;, which causes sleep to be impaired and daytime energy to suffer. Meta-analyses estimate that about a third of women with PCOS have OSA, without even having any classic risk factors. Untreated OSA worsens insulin resistance, blood pressure, and fatigue, and it is no surprise that mornings feel like waking up in wet sand. If your partner complains that you snore loudly or have pauses in breathing while asleep, or you wake up tired and also have headaches in the morning it is important to go for a sleep study; OSA treatment can improve daytime function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Mental health&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt; Depression and anxiety rates are higher in PCOS, and fatigue is often the loudest symptom of a low mood. That is not a character flaw; it’s biology and lived experience: acne, hair changes, weight cycling, fertility worries, and years spent seeking a diagnosis can all contribute to mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compassionate care and evidence-based therapy help; so does acknowledging that bad energy days aren’t laziness, they’re part of the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="referpara"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also Read:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pcos-hidden-toll-of-academic-pressure-on-our-daughters-health/article67327587.ecehttps:/www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pcos-hidden-toll-of-academic-pressure-on-our-daughters-health/article67327587.ece" target="_self"&gt;PCOS: hidden toll of academic pressure on health among young girls &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Staying functional&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do you stay functional at work when your body’s signals are unpredictable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, think: fuel like a marathoner. A lower-glycaemic pattern, with fibre-rich vegetables, proteins, healthy fats, and slow carbs—flattens the post-lunch slump for many people with PCOS. You don’t need perfection; you need steadiness: a breakfast with protein, a lunch that isn’t a sugar spike, and a 4 p.m. snack that isn’t a candy bar. Current evidence and guidelines don’t crown a single “PCOS diet,” but they consistently emphasise calorie quality, weight neutrality or gradual loss where appropriate, and glycaemic control to improve symptoms and metabolic risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, build micro-movement into your schedule. Insulin resistance improves with muscles contracting regularly, not just at the gym. Two-minute “movement snacks” each hour—walk to fill your bottle, calf raises at the printer, stairs instead of the elevator—can be the difference between fog and focus by late afternoon. It’s physiology, not discipline moving glucose into muscle without demanding more insulin that smooths energy curves through the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, consider your sleep like the audit of any project. Set bed and wake times, dimmer in the evenings, cooler rooms, and caffeine cutoffs become important when your hormones are already nudging your circadian rhythm. If you’re still getting out of bed fatigued, ask about screening for OSA. Sleep treatment such as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy is effective for nights and can rescue workdays. ,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, consider targeted supplements and medications with your doctor. Myo-inositol continues to grow in traction for metabolic improvement and hyperandrogenism in PCOS, and some people benefit from metformin (along with drugs like combined hormonal contraception), or other targeted therapy. None are quick fixes, but over weeks, they can lift the baseline, so your good days outnumber the bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifth, plan your “energy economy.” Schedule cognitively heavy tasks earlier in the day when you’re sharper. Batch admin during predictable dips. Have a water bottle at your elbow; mild dehydration increases fatigue and headaches. And if heavy periods are normal for you, request iron studies, as iron deficiency is an under-recognised factor causing fatigue in menstruators and is treatable when diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The workplace’s role&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workplaces have a part to play too. Research has shown that those with PCOS may have lower work ability and increased sickness absence; normalising this allows for practical supports—flexible start times following poor-sleep nights, remote work on flare days, times to attend medical appointments—without stigma. Small accommodations can reduce presenteeism and protect productivity much better than powering through and burning out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember this: PCOS management isn’t a single heroic act; it’s stacking small, boring wins, consistent meals, micro movements, skilful sleep, the right treatment plan, and a humane work setup. When these habits compound, the afternoon fog lifts more often, your energy lasts longer, and your best work stops feeling like a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dr. Sandhya Rani is senior consultant, obstetrics &amp;amp; gynaecology, Aster Women &amp;amp; Children Hospital, Bengaluru. sanju.doc@gmail.com)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- September 09, 2025 03:00 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>常见便秘药物有望阻止肾衰竭- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/common-constipation-drug-shows-promise-in-halting-kidney-decline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A constipation drug has shown promise in slowing kidney damage in chronic kidney disease patients by improving gut and mitochondrial health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a widespread and serious medical condition. For many individuals, the progressive loss of kidney function ultimately requires regular dialysis to prevent kidney failure and sustain life. Although CKD poses a major global health challenge, no drug has yet been approved that can directly enhance kidney performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by Professor Takaaki Abe at Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine has uncovered a surprising possibility. They tested a medication normally prescribed for constipation and found that it may help protect kidney health. For the first time, this drug (lubiprostone) demonstrated an ability to slow the decline of kidney function in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further,” explains Abe. “Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;

This improved renal function by increasing the levels of aguA and polyamines. Credit: Shun Watanabe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this idea, the researchers launched a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine medical institutions in Japan. The study involved 150 patients with moderate CKD and carefully assessed how lubiprostone influenced their kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1505" data-end="1534"&gt;Clinical Trial Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, compared to the placebo group, the decline in kidney function (defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate: eGFR) was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated the mechanism underlying how this effect occurred. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting bacterial growth in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect – suppressing further kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team has plans to validate the trial results in a larger population (Phase 3 clinical trial) and advance the exploration of biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. Their goal is to provide each patient with CKD the optimal treatment plan tailored to their needs. This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

Baumer&lt;/a&gt; is a professor at the &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/en/"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt; who has played a central role in the Antikythera project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As co-director of the excavation alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.esag.swiss/"&gt;Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece&lt;/a&gt;, he has emphasized that the site is far more than a collection of treasures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus is on understanding the structure, orientation, and construction methods of the ship itself, which offers insights into ancient trade and maritime engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-the-antikythera-shipwreck"&gt;Importance of the Antikythera shipwreck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without any doubt, a unique &lt;a href="https://www.whoi.edu/ocean-learning-hub/ocean-topics/ocean-human-lives/underwater-archaeology/antikythera-shipwreck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shipwreck from antiquity&lt;/a&gt;,” said Baumer. Scholars call this site one-of-a-kind because it keeps changing what we know about ancient trade, engineering, and seafaring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wreck lies between roughly 150 and 230 feet below the surface, a depth that helps protect wood and metal from storms and anchors. Work here continues in careful, slow steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divers documented a preserved section of the hull with original fasteners and an external protective coating still intact. That structural find anchors the ship on the seabed and helps define its size and orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded roughly 300 discoveries spread across two excavation zones located about 650 feet apart. These included 21 marble fragments, various pieces of the ship’s hull, over 200 ceramic shards, and amphorae linked to places such as Chios and Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, the wreck has never been investigated as a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/discovery-300-year-old-sunken-pirate-shipwreck-left-archaeologists-speechless/"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;, but the treasures have simply been extracted,” explained Baumer, who added that researchers confirmed a nearby second vessel from the same period, documented about 650 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some amphorae show evidence of mastic, a natural resin used as a sealant in antiquity. That detail speaks to the practical tricks ancient crews used to keep liquid cargo safe at sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ancient-builders-made-ships"&gt;How ancient builders made ships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preserved hull section points to a shell-first-build, a method common in the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages. Builders assembled the outer planking first and then fitted frames inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern, supported by nautical archaeology, is clear in a peer reviewed &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-9270.2012.00357.x"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that summarizes the transition from shell first to frame first shipbuilding across the first millennium AD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortise and tenon joints, pegs, and pitch created strong, watertight hulls that could handle long routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mysterious-antikythera-mechanism"&gt;Mysterious Antikythera mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But long before this season, the world knew of Antikythera not for the ship but for for the Antikythera mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the device was uncovered, it constituted one of the most significant discoveries in the history of shipwrecks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique mechanism is an ancient astronomical calculator with complex bronze gears that modeled cycles of the Sun, Moon, and planets; technology leaps beyond its time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator, has challenged researchers since its discovery in 1901,” wrote &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tony-Freeth"&gt;Tony Freeth&lt;/a&gt;, Professor at University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern imaging revealed hidden inscriptions and internal gearing that pushed ancient engineering far beyond what many expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/08161259/Antikythera-Mechanism-shipwreck_greek-cosmos-tracker_reconstructed-pieces_Nature_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/08161306/Antikythera-Mechanism-shipwreck_greek-cosmos-tracker_reconstructed-pieces_Nature_1s.webp" alt="Parts of a Model of the Cosmos in the ancient Greek Antikythera Mechanism found on a shipwreck from the First Century, BCE.

That layout let users read multiple cycles at once with simple pointers and engraved scales instead of long, cluttered hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writing on the device worked like an instruction guide, explaining what each ring and marker was for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front and back panels described regular planetary events, like when planets line up with the Sun or appear opposite it, and those matched the positions shown on the rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those instructions pair with the calendar so a person can count days between events directly on the dials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging known as Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (&lt;a href="https://www.shimadzu.com/an/products/non-destructive-testing/microfocus-x-ray-ct-system/index.html"&gt;MXCT&lt;/a&gt;) exposed buried lettering that tied each planet’s events to specific index marks on its ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-numbers-behind-the-gears"&gt;The numbers behind the gears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists worked out time cycles that could be built into the gears, such as Venus completing 289 cycles in 462 years or Saturn completing 427 cycles in 442 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers were chosen because they allowed for gears with manageable tooth counts that still produced accurate planetary motions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested different possible cycles without needing highly precise measurements, then picked ones that shared common factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, the same gears could be used in more than one part of the mechanism, keeping it compact and efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-planetary-motion"&gt;Unlocking planetary motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solving this complex 3D puzzle reveals a creation of genius,” wrote Freeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism contained gearing that modeled the movements of the Sun, Moon, and five known planets with impressive accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using ratios that could be translated into compact gears, it captured cycles that had been studied for centuries by Babylonian and Greek astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made this possible was a design that translated complex theories into practical engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nested tubes and rings allowed planetary markers to move together in a geocentric order, turning the device into a working model of the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recreating-the-antikythera-mechanism"&gt;Recreating the Antikythera Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/08161245/Antikythera-Mechanism_greek-cosmos-tracker_ancient-shipwreck-discovery_Nature_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/08161251/Antikythera-Mechanism_greek-cosmos-tracker_ancient-shipwreck-discovery_Nature_1s.webp" alt="Computer model of the Greek Antikythera Mechanism found on a shipwreck from the First Century, BCE.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This above image reconstruction of the Antikythera Mechanism displays a layered system of celestial motions. At the center sit the dome of the Earth, the Moon’s phase, and its position in the Zodiac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around these are rings representing Mercury, Venus, the true Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Date, each marked with small spheres to track positions and additional markers for oppositions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planetary rings are inscribed with scale marks and index letters that record the synodic cycles of the planets. Encircling everything are the bands of the Zodiac and the Egyptian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Sun’s ring, a golden sphere with a pointer indicates the true Sun’s position, as described in the BCI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Sun and Moon pointers align, the Moon’s sphere turns black to mark the New Moon; when they oppose one another, the sphere turns white to show the Full Moon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “Dragon Hand” marks the lunar nodes: the Head for the ascending node, the Tail for the descending node. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small triangles along the Sun’s ring show the eclipse limits, and eclipses are possible when the Dragon Hand falls within these boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moon’s pointer position relative to the Dragon Hand shows whether it lies north or south of the node. Finally, a Date pointer fixed to a narrow outer ring displays the current date in the Egyptian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-science-of-the-antikythera-mechanism"&gt;Science of the Antikythera Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fragments show not only scientific ambition but also fine craftsmanship. The gears were cut from bronze with precise tooth counts, and the inscriptions offered instructions that linked theory to daily use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination of mathematics and engineering reveals how knowledge was made accessible through tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests the builders selected cycles that balanced accuracy with mechanical feasibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By sharing gears across gear trains and keeping counts manageable, they created a compact system that could still show planetary phases and eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern reconstructions show that the Antikythera Mechanism was more than a timekeeper. It was a scientific instrument that automated predictions of astronomical events, centuries before such technology was thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving its puzzle highlights a design of genius that combined traditions from Babylon, insights from Plato’s Academy, and Greek theories of planetary motion. It reminds us that innovation is not just a modern story but one deeply rooted in the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece (ESAG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 09:05:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOallkSUZBUUxhM2R3SEpxbUNGTDlqMlM1OGJxb3o1OS1saEFibFFKTlllUFJObU02aWY0UENQQmxYTWxucEV5SUpyUFIybTg4bXQ3S19yYWJaS2h1MzZRVnJMX0V4WFUxa2h4TTdFbW9pQlJLRHVEcXZUM3NBTy0ySnNzUHpsWHdFZ2h0R1lSd0NDRmNyakVYbWtfYWowbFU</guid></item><item><title>父母正在悄悄地为他们的青少年尝试氯胺酮疗法。这非常有争议。-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/09/ketamine-therapys-controversial-rise-in-youth/85623408007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86041165007-lucy.jpeg?width=300&amp;amp;height=463&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86041165007-lucy.jpeg?width=600&amp;amp;height=926&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt="Most therapeutic ketamine users are in their 30s or older, but Lucy was just 16 when she started the treatment.

Jacintha, a horseback rider, was familiar with &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/30/elon-musk-ketamine-trump-campaign/83942817007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ketamine&lt;/a&gt; as a horse tranquilizer but had never heard of it as a last-stop mental health treatment for treatment-resistant patients like Lucy, who was diagnosed with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There was only one thing: Most ketamine users are in their 30s or older. Lucy was just 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When people are desperate, you're ready to take desperate measures,” says Jacintha, who asked that we withhold her last name to protect her daughter's medical privacy. “I think any parent who sees their child struggling as hard as Lucy was struggling would want to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/12/what-is-ketamine/72499723007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ketamine therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining popularity in recent years and, in select cases, has been used to treat young people. Doctors say it can provide life-saving support in instances where other medications have failed, but there are risks involved, including the potential for dependence when improperly administered. Despite the potential dangers, some young users and their families say trying the controversial therapy is preferable to being stuck in the status quo.Dozens of commenters on Reddit talk about seeking out care for minors, but most USA TODAY spoke with declined to go on the record for fear of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The detrimental effect on the brain of growing up with severe treatment-resistant depression is far worse than the whatever risk that we associate with the very sporadic dosing of these low doses of ketamine,” says Chair of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine John Krystal. However, he adds there’s little research about ketamine therapy’s effect on young adults, and as such, it should be a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How ketamine therapy works in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A few months after that Google search, Jacintha and Lucy walked into the Northwest Ketamine Clinic’s Bellevue, Washington, outpost, where Lucy began the first of 12 ketamine infusion sessions, all administered in April and May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The doctors had explained how the ketamine infusion would work: The chemical would bind to receptors in the brain, interfering with the connection between the brain and the body, leading to a disconnected, out-of-body feeling where Lucy might experience detachment from reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That first session, Jacintha held Lucy’s hand, cautiously optimistic. Things got worse before they got better, and Lucy experienced mood swings and random spurts of anger. But after the seventh session, it was like something “just completely shifted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The therapy helped her manage her self-harm and contamination-triggered OCD. Before ketamine therapy, hearing someone cough or breathe loudly in the classroom would send her into panic mode, ultimately causing her to drop out of school. At home, she didn’t enter the downstairs kitchen at all, feeling too overwhelmed by the fridge, dirty dishes, and smells from cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After the infusions, “I was feeling way better than ever before,” Lucy says. “It really did shift my mood a lot. I was just generally at a higher level of functioning every day; I wasn't depressed all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A representative for Northwest Ketamine Clinic says their clinics don’t treat anyone under the age of 14, but they've seen a rise in interest from parents looking to treat teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ketamine works by stimulating the brain’s resilience mechanisms, according to Krystal. The chemical targets a different system in the brain than standard antidepressants, triggering the release of glutamate, which stimulates the growth of new synapses between brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The plasticity of the brain ‒ the ability to learn, adapt, respond ‒ becomes compromised by depression,” Krystal says. “Even a single dose of ketamine can have a positive effect on this kind of plasticity, which may make psychotherapies and (other) kinds of interventions work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86041995007-image-15.jpeg?width=300&amp;amp;height=451&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Laura Pickard sought ketamine therapy for relief from depression and grief.

She had battled depression and anxiety since age 15, cycling through medications like Prozac and Wellbutrin. In 2022, her father died of an overdose, and just 16 months later, her mother died by suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Following her mother’s death, she paused her education at Baylor University and returned home to Los Angeles, where she began working with a counselor who specialized in loss. She described coming out of her depression as putting on glasses for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Before ketamine, everything took five times the amount of effort for me to do because of my depression,” Pickard says. “Going through my ketamine treatments, I woke up motivated to do things; I had energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Pickard has since done three maintenance sessions, which she credited with helping her return to school to finish her degree last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I still get the sense that I was a little too young for it'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When Krystal started studying ketamine in the 1990s, it was still known as a horse tranquilizer or by the street name Special K. In recent years, high-profile figures like &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/03/19/what-is-ketamine-elon-musk/73025449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, Chrissy Teigen and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2022/07/08/ketamine-therapy-depression-praised-celebs-heres-what-know/7776023001/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;amp;gca-cat=p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Sharon Osborne&lt;/a&gt; have talked about using the substance for therapeutic purposes, contributing to its name recognition. Most notably, abuse of the drug was linked to &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/12/15/matthew-perry-ketamine-effects/71936903007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt;’s death after he was using ketamine under the care of a physician for the treatment of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ketamine therapy’s most common short-term side effects are dizziness and nausea, but in extreme cases, long-term, heavy use of ketamine is associated with memory problems, gastrointestinal issues, and urinary tract infections, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/ketamine#health-risks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37153136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2017 case study&lt;/a&gt; from the Yale Child Study Center found depressive symptoms dramatically reduced for adolescents ages 13 to 17 with treatment-resistant depression within 24 hours of receiving an infusion of the therapy, and the improvements lasted at least two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I really would just proceed with caution on this for kids because it's not really been studied in that age group,” says Dr. Ryan Sultan, a psychiatrist specializing in ketamine treatment at Integrative Psychiatry. “The younger the brain, the more unformed it is, and therefore the greater potential of negative effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lucy doesn’t regret the ketamine therapy, but says it’s a bigger step than she realized at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I still get the sense that I was a little too young for it, and I wonder, could I have tried something else?” Lucy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Krystal says that ketamine is most effective in a very narrow dose range: a doubled dose would lead to more side effects, but not more effectiveness, and halving the dose would lose the antidepressant effectiveness. He’s seen instances of misuse where people start using ketamine as many as eight times a day, leading their depression to worsen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lucy and Pickard receive treatment through intravenous (IV) ketamine therapy ‒ a legal but off-label use of the drug. The only FDA-approved form of the therapy is an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/esketamine-nasal-route/description/drg-20458442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;esketamine&lt;/a&gt; nasal spray known as Spravato, but the majority of ketamine therapy administered is through IV, according to Sultan. Neither form is FDA-approved for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The result is that the field of ketamine therapy goes unregulated. After the FDA &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250202084452/https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-nasal-spray-medication-treatment-resistant-depression-available-only-certified" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;approved esketamine in 2019,&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of independent, outpatient ketamine clinics sprang up around the country. These clinics might employ a mixture of anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and therapists, but quality and safety vary across clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Insurance rarely covers IV ketamine therapy, and users pay hundreds per session out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Krystal warns that people using ketamine for therapy outside of clinics often improperly administer it. Most of the ketamine distributed in the United States is done so illegally, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Ketamine-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;​”Adolescents are at greater risk for addiction problems, and so the concerns that I raise about people having access to ketamine at home are even heightened for adolescents,” Krystal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jacintha initially worried about introducing the feeling of ketamine to Lucy, but has spoken with Lucy about the dangers of seeking out that feeling in a non-clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Am I inadvertently introducing her to a euphoric feeling that she may want to continue pursuing in other ways?” Jacintha says. “If she no longer has access to ketamine, but she still wants to go back to the feeling that ketamine gave her, will that lead her into other types of drug abuse?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why ketamine therapy isn't a cure-all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Since April of 2023, Lucy has done four maintenance sessions, one every six months, which she utilizes in combination with talk therapy and antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s still prevalent today, sometimes depending on my stress and my mood. But I think the biggest reason why my OCD got more manageable is because my depression was more manageable,” Lucy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, Jacintha says she wishes they saw bigger results and cautioned that it's not a miracle cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I wish that this had been the cannonball that we were looking for, to blow this whole thing open, and it wasn't," Jacintha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, Lucy and Jacintha knew the risks of ketamine therapy. But they agreed any side effects would pale in comparison to the struggles Lucy was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people think that I'm a bad parent because I chose to give my child ketamine, I would invite you to come and live my life,” Jacintha says. “When you have a child that is in such acute mental anguish, and you see them drowning every day, you cling to hope, that's all you have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Hale’s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that dormant breast cancer cells can be detected and wiped out with existing drugs, dramatically lowering the risk of relapse. The breakthrough brings new hope to survivors haunted by the fear of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough Trial Targets Dormant Breast Cancer Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landmark federally funded clinical trial has provided the first real evidence that doctors can pinpoint breast cancer survivors at higher risk of relapse by detecting dormant cancer cells, and that these hidden cells can be successfully treated using already available drugs. The work, led by researchers at the Abramson Cancer Center of the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;University of Pennsylvania&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is a prestigious private Ivy League research university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin, Penn is one of the oldest universities in the United States. It is renowned for its strong emphasis on interdisciplinary education and its professional schools, including the Wharton School, one of the leading business schools globally. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs across various fields such as law, medicine, engineering, and arts and sciences. Penn is also known for its significant contributions to research, innovative teaching methods, and active campus life, making it a hub of academic and extracurricular activity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt; and Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine, appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although survival rates for breast cancer continue to improve thanks to better screening and therapies, the disease remains incurable once it comes back after initial treatment. About 30 percent of women and men experience a relapse, leaving them dependent on ongoing treatment that cannot completely remove the cancer. Some forms, such as triple negative and HER2+, often reappear within a few years, while ER+ cases can resurface even decades later. Until now, doctors had no way to identify which survivors carried dormant cells that fuel recurrence or to step in with a therapy that could prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Hidden Threat of Cancer Relapse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the randomized phase II trial, 51 breast cancer survivors were tested with existing drugs, which successfully cleared dormant tumor cells in 80 percent of participants. After three years, the survival rate without any return of disease exceeded 90 percent among patients given a single drug and reached 100 percent for those who received both medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lingering fear of cancer returning is something that hangs over many breast cancer survivors after they celebrate the end of treatment,” said principal investigator Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, FASCO, the Mariann T. and Robert J. MacDonald Professor in Breast Cancer Research. “Right now, we just don’t know when or if someone’s cancer will come back—that’s the problem we set out to solve. Our study shows that preventing recurrence by monitoring and targeting dormant tumor cells is a strategy that holds real promise, and I hope it ignites more research in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Survivors’ Hope: Preventing Recurrence Before It Starts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds on &lt;a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-021-01416-9"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-024-01878-7"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that showed how dormant tumor cells continue to lay in wait in some patients after breast cancer treatment. These so-called “sleeper cells,” also referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD), can reactivate years or even decades later. Because they are not “active” cancer cells and can be scattered throughout the body, they do not show up on standard imaging tests that are used to watch for breast cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the sleeper cells begin to expand and circulate in the bloodstream, it can lead to the spread of metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have MRD are more likely to experience breast cancer recurrence and have decreased overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why Dormant Cells Escape Detection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis Chodosh, MD, PhD, chair of Cancer Biology and senior author of the study, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4497740/"&gt;previously led research&lt;/a&gt; to identify the pathways that allow dormant tumor cells to survive in patients for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that this sleeper phase represents an opportunity to intervene and eradicate the dormant tumor cells before they have the chance to come back as aggressive, metastatic disease,” Chodosh said. “Surprisingly, we’ve found that certain drugs that &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; work against actively growing cancers &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be very effective against these sleeper cells. This tells us that the biology of dormant tumor cells is very different from active cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the preclinical part of the latest research publication, Chodosh’s team conducted a series of experiments in mice to better understand the underlying mechanisms. They showed that two different drugs—approved by the FDA to treat other conditions—could effectively clear MRD in mice, resulting in longer survival without cancer recurrence. The drugs target autophagy and mTOR signaling, which the researchers found were key mechanisms to allow the tumor cells to remain dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How FDA-Approved Drugs Target Dormant Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMichele’s team first enrolled breast cancer survivors who had completed treatment within the last five years and had clear scans into a screening study that looked for dormant tumor cells in participant’s bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If dormant tumor cells were found, patients were then eligible to enroll in the Phase II CLEVER clinical trial, which randomized patients to receive six cycles of either monotherapy with one of two study drugs, or combination therapy with both drugs. The treatment cleared dormant tumor cells in most patients after six to 12 months. After a median follow-up time of 42 months, only two patients on the study have experienced a cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The CLEVER Trial: Promising Early Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to be able to give patients a better option than ‘wait and see’ after they complete breast cancer treatment,” DeMichele said. “We’re encouraged by these results that we’re on the right track.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is already enrolling patients in two larger, ongoing studies to confirm and extend the results of the CLEVER study: the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/v?id=NCI-2021-12420"&gt;Phase II ABBY clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/v?id=NCI-2021-06208"&gt;Phase II PALAVY clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, available at several cancer centers across the country. &lt;strong&gt;Patients interested in learning more about these or other breast cancer clinical trials at Penn Medicine should contact &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7032021511030433111e131502331c191e1913111c240219111c033000151e1e1d15141913191e155e0500151e1e5e151405"&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f8ba8a9d998b8cbb99969b9d8abb949196919b9994ac8a9199948bb8889d9696959d9c919b91969dd68d889d9696d69d9c8d"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;A research institute in Japan says the number of people infected so far this year with a disease transmitted mainly by ticks has reached a record high.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome, or SFTS, can cause a reduction in blood platelets, hemorrhaging or unconsciousness. The health ministry says from 10 percent to 30 percent of cases are fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;Preliminary data announced by the Japan Institute for Health Security show four new cases in the seven days to the end of August. That brought the 2025 total to date to 149, surpassing the previous high set for all of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;The institute says cases have been reported in 32 prefectures, mainly in western Japan. It says 14 were in Kochi, 12 in Oita, 9 each in Kumamoto and Nagasaki and 8 each in Kagoshima, Shimane and Hyogo.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;It says there were also infections in the Kanto region and Hokkaido, where no cases were reported until last year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;The health ministry says cases could be reported in areas other than western Japan. It is calling on people to reduce skin exposure and take other precautions when going outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

Set in the future, Earth has been struck by a global crop blight. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is pulled into a NASA mission to transport the human race to a new planet, via wormhole. Back on Earth, Cooper's daughter, Murph (Jessica Chastain), attempts to complete an equation that will allow this mass-transport of humanity from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists praised the film, particularly for its depiction of black holes.

It is easy to dismiss that agonizing cramping feeling on a walk if it goes away with rest. But experts warn that these are signs that something more ominous is going on in your arteries.&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sumit Kapadia, one of the finest vascular and endovascular specialists, recently shared a case of a patient who had blamed his leg pain on age. He described, "My legs hurt when I walked, but when I sat down, the pain went away. I figured it was not too bad." After they probed further, they discovered that the cause was blocked arteries in the legs, or Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).&lt;br&gt; PAD affects blood flow to the lower body and, if not treated, can lead to severe problems like infections, ulcers, or amputation. Early detection is key, and in his patients, Dr. Kapadia regularly sees these six early warning signs:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>新的“快速球”测试可以在3分钟内评估阿尔茨海默氏症的风险- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-fastball-test-could-assess-alzheimers-risk-in-just-3-minutes</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

It's a progressive condition, in which brain cells are slowly damaged and die – leading to memory loss, confusion, and difficulties with thinking and daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-discovers"&gt;Your Vision Can Predict Dementia 12 Years Before Diagnosis, Study Discovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease process begins long before symptoms manifest. Proteins called amyloid and tau gradually build up in the brain, forming plaques and tangles that interfere with communication between nerve cells. By the time memory problems are significant enough for diagnosis, much of the damage has already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173515" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642.jpg" alt="tau tangles" class="wp-image-173515 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173515" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tangles of tau proteins can trigger the death of neurons, leading to Alzheimer's disease.

This means the amount of amyloid plaques and tau tangles a person has in their brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00642-9"&gt;doesn't always match&lt;/a&gt; the severity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the amount of plaques and tangles can only be estimated via imaging or blood tests. These factors make Alzheimer's disease difficult to diagnose and predict how it will progress. This is why researchers are keen to develop tests that can spot signs of the disease earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, diagnosis has relied on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S212328"&gt;cognitive screening tests&lt;/a&gt;, where a doctor asks a patient to remember words, copy drawings, or complete problem-solving tasks. These tools are effective, but take time and require trained staff. They may also be stressful for the patients and can be influenced by factors such as a person's education level, their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/15333175221117006"&gt;language skills&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence7040022"&gt;test-related performance anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More advanced diagnostic options, including brain scans and laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (a fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord), can indicate the presence of Alzheimer's disease in the brain. But these tests are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2024.103911"&gt;expensive and invasive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173511" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-173511 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173511" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans can indicate risk of Alzheimer's, but are expensive. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEGJABe-88/"&gt;pixelshot/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/projects/diagnosing-dementia-using-fastball-neurocognitive-assessment/"&gt;Fastball EEG test&lt;/a&gt; uses a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking patients to actively recall or solve problems, it measures how the brain responds to images flashed on a screen. Participants first see a set of eight pictures, which they're asked to name but not memorise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, during the test, hundreds of images are shown in quick succession – around three per second. Every fifth image is one of the eight previously shown. The EEG headset records the brain's electrical activity, picking up tiny signals that reveal whether the brain recognises these familiar images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people, the recognition response is clear. But in people with &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (problems with thinking, memory, or problem-solving, which often precedes Alzheimer's disease) and especially those with memory issues, the response is weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the test's suitability, researchers recruited 106 participants to their study. This included 54 healthy adults and 52 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Among the latter group, some had memory-specific problems (amnestic MCI), while others had difficulties unrelated to memory – such as problems with attention (non-amnestic MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the Fastball test was sensitive enough to distinguish between these groups. Those with amnestic MCI showed significantly reduced brain responses to the familiar images compared to healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. In other words, the test quickly identified the kind of memory impairment most closely linked to early Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then repeated the test a year later. Some of the participants who'd only had mild cognitive impairment in the first test had progressed to either Alzheimer's disease dementia or another type of dementia, called &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/vascular-dementia"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which manifests in symptoms similar to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked the participants who developed dementia to perform the standard cognitive tests currently used to diagnose Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants showed no or little difference in this test, which means the test wasn't sensitive enough to detect the transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. But with the Fastball test, the participants performed marginally worse than they had previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, of the 42 participants with mild cognitive impairment who repeated the Fastball test a year later, only eight had transitioned to dementia. So, although the results are very promising in illustrating the test's accuracy, they should be interpreted with caution as they're based on a small number of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the test is fast – lasting only three minutes. It also doesn't rely on the participant's effort, mood, or test-taking ability, which can influence cognitive test results. It can also be done at home or in a GP's office, which might reduce anxiety for patients and make it easier to reach a larger group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study did not include other conditions where &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/worried-about-memory-problems/causes-of-memory-problems"&gt;memory impairment is also present&lt;/a&gt; – such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="173505" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or thyroid problems – so it cannot be used as a standalone diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease. Future studies in more diverse populations, which take these other conditions into account, will be needed to better understand the test's strengths, limitations, and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tests, which are currently in development, may be better for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease specifically. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests#:%7E:text=Blood%20tests,-Researchers%20are%20investigating&amp;amp;text=These%20markers%20may%20include%20tau,tests%20to%20diagnose%20the%20disease."&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; could transform Alzheimer's diagnosis once they're more widely rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measure proteins linked to Alzheimer's and can give a snapshot of disease processes happening in the brain. Some tests currently being studied would only require a &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases_2023/finger-prick-blood-test-alzheimers-disease.asp"&gt;finger-prick of blood&lt;/a&gt;. If they prove to be accurate, this could mean patients could do these tests at home and mail them in for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools such as the Fastball test and blood tests could help shift the focus of Alzheimer's care from late diagnosis to early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying people at risk of the disease years earlier, doctors could recommend lifestyle changes, monitor patients more closely, or provide them with appropriate therapies earlier, while they can still make the most difference.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264519/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaf189" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that the relatively high rate of autism-spectrum disorders in humans is likely due to how humans evolved in the past. The paper is titled "A general principle of neuronal evolution reveals a human accelerated neuron type potentially underlying the high prevalence of autism in humans."&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;About one in 31 (3.2%) children in the United States has been identified with autism spectrum disorder. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that around one in 100 children have autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+perspective/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary perspective&lt;/a&gt;, many scientists believe that autism and schizophrenia may be unique to humans. It is very rare to find behaviors associated with the disorders in non-human primates. In addition, behaviors associated with those disorders generally involve cognitive traits like speech production and comprehension that are either unique to or much more sophisticated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of single cell RNA sequencing, it became possible to define specific cell types across the brain. As investigators published more large-scale datasets, it became clear that the mammalian brain contains a staggering array of neuronal cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, large-scale sequencing studies have identified extensive genetic changes in the brain unique to Homo sapiens—genomic elements that did not change much in mammalian evolution in general but evolved rapidly in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While previous investigations found that some cell types have remained more consistent throughout evolution than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers here investigated recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mammalian+brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mammalian brain&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the most abundant type of outer-layer brain neurons, L2/3 IT neurons, evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by dramatic changes in autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by natural selection specific to the human lineage. The researchers explain that although the results strongly suggest natural selection for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autism+spectrum+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;-associated genes, the reason why this conferred fitness benefits to human ancestors is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering this is difficult because we do not know what human-specific features of cognition, brain anatomy, and neuronal wiring gave human ancestors a fitness advantage, but the investigators here speculate that many of these genes are associated with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/developmental+delay/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;developmental delay&lt;/a&gt;, so their evolution could have contributed to the slower postnatal brain development in humans compared to chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the capacity for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/speech+production/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;speech production&lt;/a&gt; and comprehension unique to humans is often affected by autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the rapid evolution of autism-linked genes conferred a fitness advantage by slowing postnatal brain development or increasing the capacity for language; the lengthier brain development time in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/early+childhood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early childhood&lt;/a&gt; was beneficial to human evolution because it led to more complex thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that some of the same genetic changes that make the human brain unique also made humans more neurodiverse," said the paper's lead author, Alexander L. Starr.&lt;/p&gt;

And as every teenager should know, they won't reach their full height potential without adequate growth hormone from a full night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why lack of sleep -- in particular the early, deep phase called non-REM sleep -- lowers levels of growth hormone has been a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the current issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from University of California, Berkeley, dissect the brain circuits that control growth hormone release during sleep and report a novel feedback mechanism in the brain that keeps growth hormone levels finely balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings provide a map for understanding how sleep and hormone regulation interact. The new feedback mechanism could open avenues for treating people with sleep disorders tied to metabolic conditions like diabetes, as well as degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," said study first author Xinlu Ding, a postdoctoral fellow in UC Berkeley's Department of Neuroscience and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. "We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because growth hormone regulates glucose and fat metabolism, insufficient sleep can also worsen risks for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sleep-wake cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurons that orchestrate growth hormone release during the sleep-wake cycle -- growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons and two types of somatostatin neurons -- are buried deep in the hypothalamus, an ancient brain hub conserved in all mammals. Once released, growth hormone increases the activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus, an area in the brainstem involved in arousal, attention, cognition and novelty seeking. Dysregulation of locus coeruleus neurons is implicated in numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," said Daniel Silverman, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow and study co-author. "There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type. This circuit could be a novel handle to try to dial back the excitability of the locus coeruleus, which hasn't been talked about before."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, working in the lab of Yang Dan, a professor of neuroscience and of molecular and cell biology, explored the neuroendocrine circuit by inserting electrodes in the brains of mice and measuring changes in activity after stimulating neurons in the hypothalamus with light. Mice sleep for short periods -- several minutes at a time -- throughout the day and night, providing many opportunities to study growth hormone changes during sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using state-of-the-art circuit tracing, the team found that the two small-peptide hormones that control the release of growth hormone in the brain -- GHRH, which promotes release, and somatostatin, which inhibits release -- operate differently during REM and non-REM sleep. Somatostatin and GHRH surge during REM sleep to boost growth hormone, but somatostatin decreases and GHRH increases only moderately during non-REM sleep to boost growth hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released growth hormone regulates locus coeruleus activity, as a feedback mechanism to help create a homeostatic yin-yang effect. During sleep, growth hormone slowly accumulates to stimulate the locus coeruleus and promote wakefulness, the new study found. But when the locus coeruleus becomes overexcited, it paradoxically promotes sleepiness, as Silverman showed in a study published earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system: Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness," Silverman said. "Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because growth hormone acts in part through the locus coeruleus, which governs overall brain arousal during wakefulness, a proper balance could have a broader impact on attention and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Growth hormone not only helps you build your muscle and bones and reduce your fat tissue, but may also have cognitive benefits, promoting your overall arousal level when you wake up," Ding said.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the exact mechanisms through which alcohol accelerates liver damage remained unclear to scientists, that is till now. However, a 2025 research study discovered a fresh gut–liver pathway, which explains how chronic alcohol consumption damages liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new find&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team of Nature (PMID: 40836099), discovered that long-term alcohol consumption decreases the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4) in the small intestine. The receptor mAChR4 plays a vital role in maintaining gut bacterial control through its function in goblet cells, which line the intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Critical signs that indicate the onset of a liver disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut lining contains goblet cells which produce GAPs (goblet cell-associated antigen passages). The immune system receives training through GAPs, to identify and regulate gut bacteria. The reduction of mAChR4 by alcohol consumption prevents goblet cells from creating proper GAPs. Because of this, the immune system becomes less capable of handling gut bacteria because of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens as a result&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of GAPs creates an environment where bacteria from the gut can escape through the gut barrier, to reach the liver. The liver becomes more susceptible to damage, when bacteria enters its tissue after reaching this organ. The research demonstrated this process occurred in both human liver biopsy samples and laboratory animal experiments. The research demonstrated that alcohol consumption resulted in decreased mAChR4 expression, which led to impaired defense mechanisms against harmful gut bacteria entering the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-liver-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research established a direct link between alcohol consumption and liver damage through the following sequence of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small intestine contains lower levels of mAChR4, when people consume alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in mAChR4 expression results in reduced goblet cell GAP production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system loses its ability to control gut bacteria when GAPs become scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria from the gut escape through the damaged gut wall to enter the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria entering the liver through this process intensify both alcohol-induced liver inflammation, and steatohepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition known as alcohol-associated liver disease, (ALD) encompasses different liver conditions which develop from prolonged alcohol consumption. The first stage of fatty liver disease known as steatosis, develops when liver cells store fat, but usually produces no noticeable symptoms. The progression of alcohol consumption leads to alcoholic steatohepatitis, which causes liver inflammation together with tissue damage. The progression of liver damage through fibrosis (scarring) eventually results in cirrhosis, which severely impairs liver function. The progression of cirrhosis results in liver failure, which creates dangerous complications that may require patients to receive a liver transplant. The research reveals how bacterial gut invasion leads to worsened inflammation and tissue damage in steatohepatitis and ALD stages, which creates new therapeutic possibilities to stop this destructive process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential for new treatments&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrated that GAP signaling restoration enables the immune system to fight bacterial infections effectively. The direct activation of mAChR4 in goblet cells of mice, protected their livers from alcohol-related damage. The discovery indicates that future medical treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease could focus on mAChR4, and its associated signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requires further testing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the research data however, stems from animal experiments together with limited human biopsy tissue analysis. The medical field lacks evidence about using mAChR4 or gp130 immune pathway treatments for patients with alcohol-related liver damage. Additional clinical trials must be conducted to determine if these innovative methods will work safely and effectively for liver protection in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can one do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors around the world say that no amount of alcohol is safe, and one should not drink at all. If you however, enjoy drinking, keep it extemely occasional, ranging from once a week (1-2 drinks only) to a couple of times in a year. Any amount greater than this can increase your dependence on alcohol, which can lead to long-term alcohol-associated liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 02:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAJBVV95cUxOMm1rcXZMTW1zc05rS2dHbWd5dVhfUk5zY0NlZWJjQWg1UVJVSkRiVWg3M2pQR0RGdTM4WTZCZk4tNFowVGZBOGFJVTNLVFdyM2JKQW9jUmJscVZuSnNrbTdrdU9Cb0xJN1puemdjTWZibnk3a0d6VnFHdGVnZEJXWl9vYWlFcG1Td0NVa3Mya2xWZUx6Y3I2emlmT1pTQTlpTjVvczdGLWhBeUk2QkM3RjVyeFRZTVFOc3hvZF85aThYcDdLdWU3WThWd1lSSXB6UXEtMlBVbXBaNFlhV0M3NzB4TlFjNXo5WV9wV2Vibmszb1d6bWh0ZUZ5bENPaGRNOEpiZHNvUS1UOXA3dkZxSEU2MjFsUVl2SnFJalhKSHFZMGI5RHdpX1F4eWxxdDFDUW1mQk9tdE9LT1RGcjNxYg</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现，近一半的糖尿病患者不知道自己患有糖尿病- KHBS</title><link>https://www.4029tv.com/article/undiagnosed-diabetes-global-study/66017606</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						When was the last time you had your blood sugar checked? It might be worth looking into, a new study says.Forty-four percent of people age 15 and older living with diabetes are undiagnosed, so they don’t know they have it, according to data analysis published Monday in the journal The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology.The study looked at data from 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2023 in a systematic review of published literature and surveys. The findings at the global level are for people age 15 and older.“The majority of people with diabetes that we report on in the study have type 2 diabetes,” said Lauryn Stafford, the lead author of the study.Around 1 in 9 adults live with diabetes worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Foundation. In the United States, 11.6% of Americans have diabetes, according to 2021 data from the American Diabetes Association.“We found that 56% of people with diabetes are aware that they have the condition,” said Stafford, a researcher for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Globally, there’s a lot of variation geographically, and also by age. So, generally, higher-income countries were doing better at diagnosing people than low- and middle-income countries.”Younger people don’t know they have diabetesPeople under 35 years were much less likely to be diagnosed if they had diabetes than people in middle age or older. Just “20% of young adults with diabetes were aware of their condition,” Stafford said.Routine screenings aren’t promoted as much for young adults as for older adults. Many larger organizations, like the American Diabetes Association, suggest annual routine screenings for adults 35 and older.“You can survive with elevated glucose levels for many, many years,” Stafford said. “People end up getting diagnosed with diabetes only at the point where they have complications,” which are more common in older adults.Depending on how long a person has had diabetes before it’s discovered, the health impacts may vary.“Diagnosing diabetes early is important because it allows for timely management to prevent or delay long-term complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss,” said Rita Kalyani, chief scientific and medical officer at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.Around one-third of adults are diagnosed with diabetes later than their earliest symptom, according to a 2018 study.What symptoms should you look for?“Symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, blurry vision, unexpected weight loss, and fatigue. However, in the early stages, most people with diabetes are asymptomatic, which highlights the importance of screening and diagnosis,” said Kalyani, a professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Johns Hopkins University.If you experience any of these symptoms or have a history of diabetes in your family, experts recommend you get a glucose screening.Globally, in 2023, about 40% of people with treated diabetes were getting optimal results and lowering their blood sugar, said Stafford. That’s why it’s important that future efforts focus on ensuring that more people receive and follow proper treatment post-diagnosis.That only 4 in 10 patients were seeing optimal results was surprising, as several well-established treatments, including insulin, Metformin and other drugs like GLP-1s, are available.People with diabetes likely also have other health issues, such as hypertension or chronic kidney disease, which can make treatment complex, Stafford added.Can you prevent diabetes?It depends.While there is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes, there are many ways to prevent the more common form of type 2 diabetes.Reducing the amount of red and processed meats you eat can help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, as previously reported by CNN. You could do this with a Mediterranean diet or by introducing more plant-based foods to your meals.In addition, limit the amount of ultraprocessed foods you eat, adding more whole foods, like fruits and nuts, instead.Incorporating physical activity into your regular routine can also decrease your risk of developing not only diabetes but also other chronic diseases. Fast walking for at least 15 minutes a day is just one form of exercise you can do.“I think, ultimately, if we can also focus more on the risk factors for developing diabetes — preventing people from needing to be diagnosed in the first place — that is also critical,” Stafford said.

&lt;p&gt;The study looked at data from 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2023 in a systematic review of published literature and surveys. The findings at the global level are for people age 15 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of people with diabetes that we report on in the study have type 2 diabetes,” said Lauryn Stafford, the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/" rel="nofollow"&gt;1 in 9 adults&lt;/a&gt; live with diabetes worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Foundation. In the United States, 11.6% of Americans have diabetes, according to 2021 data from the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/statistics/about-diabetes" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that 56% of people with diabetes are aware that they have the condition,” said Stafford, a researcher for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Globally, there’s a lot of variation geographically, and also by age. So, generally, higher-income countries were doing better at diagnosing people than low- and middle-income countries.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="younger-people-dont-know-they-have-diabetes" class="body-h2"&gt;Younger people don’t know they have diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="cream-inline-rec" class="cream-inline hidden"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People under 35 years were much less likely to be diagnosed if they had diabetes than people in middle age or older. Just “20% of young adults with diabetes were aware of their condition,” Stafford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine screenings aren’t promoted as much for young adults as for older adults. Many larger organizations, like the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351199#:~:text=Screening.,diabetes%20or%20other%20risk%20factors." rel="nofollow"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, suggest annual routine screenings for adults 35 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can survive with elevated glucose levels for many, many years,” Stafford said. “People end up getting diagnosed with diabetes only at the point where they have complications,” which are more common in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how long a person has had diabetes before it’s discovered, the health impacts may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diagnosing diabetes early is important because it allows for timely management to prevent or delay long-term complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss,” said Rita Kalyani, chief scientific and medical officer at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one-third of adults are diagnosed with diabetes later than their earliest symptom, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6481650/" rel="nofollow"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-symptoms-should-you-look-for" class="body-h2"&gt;What symptoms should you look for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, blurry vision, unexpected weight loss, and fatigue. However, in the early stages, most people with diabetes are asymptomatic, which highlights the importance of screening and diagnosis,” said Kalyani, a professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience any of these &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/warning-signs-symptoms" rel="nofollow"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; or have a history of diabetes in your family, experts recommend you get a glucose screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, in 2023, about 40% of people with treated diabetes were getting optimal results and lowering their blood sugar, said Stafford. That’s why it’s important that future efforts focus on ensuring that more people receive and follow proper treatment post-diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That only 4 in 10 patients were seeing optimal results was surprising, as several well-established treatments, including &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22601-insulin" rel="nofollow"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/description/drg-20067074" rel="nofollow"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt; and other drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/health/eli-lilly-weight-loss-glp-1-pill-orforglipron" rel="nofollow"&gt;GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;, are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes likely also have other health issues, such as hypertension or chronic kidney disease, which can make treatment complex, Stafford added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-prevent-diabetes" class="body-h2"&gt;Can you prevent diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no known way to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-1-diabetes.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, there are many ways to prevent the more common form of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-prevention/art-20047639" rel="nofollow"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the amount of red and processed meats you eat can help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/health/meat-red-processed-diabetes-wellness" rel="nofollow"&gt;previously reported by CNN&lt;/a&gt;. You could do this with a Mediterranean diet or by introducing more plant-based foods to your meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, limit the amount of ultraprocessed foods you eat, adding more whole foods, like fruits and nuts, instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating physical activity into your regular routine can also decrease your risk of developing not only diabetes but also other chronic diseases. Fast walking for at least 15 minutes a day is just one form of exercise you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think, ultimately, if we can also focus more on the risk factors for developing diabetes — preventing people from needing to be diagnosed in the first place — that is also critical,” Stafford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai"&gt;Ancient Japanese samurai&lt;/a&gt; were warriors of distinction, with a reputation for discipline and mastery of precision. Their deliberate and composed approach to movement could be an effective strength training method for elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized controlled trial by researchers from Tohoku University in Japan shows the daily practice of Rei-ho – a mindful practice of physical etiquette involving slow and careful sitting, standing, and walking movements – can boost strength in the knees, potentially protecting seniors against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;falls and injuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to do, requires no equipment, and takes just five minutes a day to see the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;Brain Boost Linked to Exercise Can Last Several Years, Scientists Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Knee extension strength – the force used to straighten knees – is a key measure of mobility and daily functioning," &lt;a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/traditional_japanese_samurai_daily_behavior_improves_leg_strength.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; exercise physiologist Ayaka Ogasawara. "These exciting results suggest that Rei-ho may help seniors maintain their independence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 34 healthy adults aged over 20 with no experience in Rei-ho, and split them into two groups. One group was instructed to continue their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;daily activities&lt;/a&gt;, while the other was asked to spend five minutes following between 20 and 22 Rei-ho squats and sit-to-stand exercises once a day, four days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173468" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises.jpg" alt="Rei-ho exercises" class="wp-image-173468 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises-321x415.jpg 321w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises-600x775.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Typical sitting and standing motions (b and d), compared with body positions in Rei-ho (a and c). (Ogasawara et al., &lt;em&gt;Tohoku J. Exp. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three months of Rei-ho, the group using the exercises showed an average 25.9 percent increase in &lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Knee_Extensors"&gt;knee extension strength&lt;/a&gt;, compared to an increase of just 2.5 percent in the control group – a significant difference in a short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the volunteers involved in the study weren't seniors, the researchers speculate that older individuals may benefit most from the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In recent years, the decline in muscle strength and physical fitness has become a significant public health concern," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1620/tjem.2025.J099"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Muscle strength naturally diminishes with age, often leading to conditions such as sarcopenia and frailty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decline is further aggravated by the widespread prevalence of sedentary lifestyles. Importantly, the reduction in strength tends to be more pronounced in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the exercise routine used in the research relies solely on the body's own weight, and is slow and deliberate, reducing the risk of injury and common consequences of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000094530"&gt;other exercises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;such as increased blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the number of people involved in the study was relatively small, and participants were trusted to perform the tasks without supervision, other studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.12.016"&gt;reached similar conclusions&lt;/a&gt;, and in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is far from the first time that traditional approaches to health have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-traditional-african-diet-appears-to-boost-the-immune-system"&gt;shown to be beneficial&lt;/a&gt; – perhaps something to bear in mind in the fast-changing modern world, where much of our focus is on the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's also valuable that those outside of Japan who want to try Rei-ho would also be able to experience a unique aspect of ancient Japanese tradition in addition to the health benefits," &lt;a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/traditional_japanese_samurai_daily_behavior_improves_leg_strength.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; exercise physiologist Akira Sato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1620/tjem.2025.J099"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Prescriptions are not needed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gmail-xmsonormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once ACIP acts on the updated COVID-19 vaccines or states take additional action to authorize pharmacy dispensing prior to ACIP recommendations, we’ll be able to offer the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines – without a prescription – in the remaining states. Right now, we can offer the updated COVID-19 vaccines to patients, prior to ACIP action, if they present an authorized prescriber’s prescription. Those states are AZ, DC, FL, GA, LA, ME, NC, OR, UT, VA, WV. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appointments can be scheduled online via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.edgepilot.com/s/15029339/0SKn33U_60uNNvvHgKVJkA?u=http://cvs.com/"&gt;CVS.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, through the CVS Health app, or patients can walk into our pharmacies and clinics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reached out to Walgreens for comment on the issue, and have yet to hear back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KTVN</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 01:20:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwJBVV95cUxPZG5ldl9sazJON3NiSUUzUVNLZlVyLXh2aWdhQnNSRlJwQkY4dXlWSjVsUnZLNmp5SlZER240Ni1YUEhzTXJCVGlzUG4wRmZMQzNocnpVU2M4cU9WZXBQMFFCSjM4SERBVDJySExsdlNaVTB6OERSYTUzbGpJNVcxaHpLU1FyNkJFX3Izb2FxOUtnZkVFS3djX2tDdlBfYnVvUlNTS21qUVdiZjVFdWs2WVBnRXdBNjhrdVZtNElPaVFXWk1FdHNxNHFHcHZzc05wYzZoVmQ3UWtyeVhVWG1SOUN4UHQyN2hXbm00Y1RpTjBmclFNb3E0eFpnUVlrZ3NiYnU5VmRNSQ</guid></item><item><title>在处方混乱中，弗吉尼亚州家庭面临获得更新的COVID-19疫苗的障碍- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/09/virginia-families-face-hurdles-getting-updated-covid-19-vaccine-amid-prescription-confusion-2/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Virginia families are hitting roadblocks getting the new COVID-19 vaccine, as shifting federal rules spark confusion over pharmacy prescription requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Virginia families are hitting roadblocks while getting the new COVID-19 vaccine, as shifting federal rules spark confusion over pharmacy prescription requirements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/09/05/statement-from-the-virginia-department-of-health-regarding-the-2025-26-covid-19-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacists can give vaccines in two ways: with a prescription from a medical provider, or under statewide protocols that allow vaccinations without a prescription — as long as they follow the immunization schedule from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current immunization schedule lists the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, but not the 2025-26 version, which is why a prescription is now required for the newer shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Hardin, a 75-year-old resident of Haymarket, told WTOP he was asked to present a prescription recently when he tried to get a vaccination at a Giant Foods Pharmacy near his home. He said he’s never been asked for a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, this is kind of a federal bureaucracy … that’s really useless,” Hardin said. “If you think about it, what doctor is going to say, ‘No, I’m not going to give you a prescription for a COVID shot?’ I mean, they’ll all give it to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardin said he is retired veteran and can get a shot at a local military base. But he said that’s at least 20 miles away and not at all convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several states have already acted on similar concerns. In Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania, pharmacists can give COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee meets Sept. 18 and 19 to vote on updated COVID-19 shots. If approved, pharmacists could give the vaccines without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just think the government is trying to dissuade citizens from getting a shot,” Hardin said. “I think that’s wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with cannabis now legal in 40 states for medical use and 24 for recreational, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical-cannabis-laws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, the stigma is quickly diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Clarke, another attendee at Crawley's party, said he's never smoked and prefers edibles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why he's drawn to the drug, Clarke told CBS News that "it does work on PTSD, pain issues, relaxation issues, brain disorders, heart disease." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some medical professionals disagree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Springer, a professor at UC San Francisco, warns that THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, may carry health risks, no matter how seniors ingest it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they are smoking marijuana, we can be pretty confident that they're harming their cardiovascular system," Springer told CBS News, adding that if they're eating THC, "they're not without risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers found cannabis use is linked to a doubled risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 29% higher risk for acute coronary syndrome and 20% higher risk for stroke, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cannabis-cardiovascular-heart-disease-death-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June. The authors analyzed data from 24 studies published from 2016 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searles, who suffers from chronic pain after a motorcycle accident five years ago, said he isn't surprised by the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I go to my doctor and he says, geez, quit drinking milk. Uh, stay away from the sugar. What isn't bad for you nowadays?" Searles said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a material that can sense tiny changes within the body, such as during an arthritis flareup, and release drugs exactly where and when they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The squishy material can be loaded with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anti-inflammatory+drugs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anti-inflammatory drugs&lt;/a&gt; that are released in response to small changes in pH in the body. During an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/arthritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; flareup, a joint becomes inflamed and slightly more acidic than the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material, developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge, has been designed to respond to this natural change in pH. As acidity increases, the material becomes softer and more jelly-like, triggering the release of drug molecules that can be encapsulated within its structure. Since the material is designed to respond only within a narrow pH range, the team says that drugs could be released precisely where and when they are needed, potentially reducing side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If used as artificial cartilage in arthritic joints, this approach could allow for the continuous treatment of arthritis, improving the efficacy of drugs to relieve pain and fight inflammation. Arthritis affects more than 10 million people in the UK, costing the NHS an estimated £10.2 billion annually. Worldwide, it is estimated to affect over 600 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While extensive clinical trials are needed before the material can be used in patients, the researchers say their approach could improve outcomes for people with arthritis, and for those with other conditions including cancer. Their &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c09897" target="_blank"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are reported in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The material developed by the Cambridge team uses specially engineered and reversible cross-links within a polymer network. The sensitivity of these links to changes in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/acidity+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;acidity levels&lt;/a&gt; gives the material highly responsive mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material was developed in Professor Oren Scherman's research group in Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry. The group specializes in designing and building these unique materials for a range of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a while now, we've been interested in using these materials in joints, since their properties can mimic those of cartilage," said Scherman, who is Professor of Supramolecular and Polymer Chemistry and Director of the Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis. "But to combine that with highly targeted drug delivery is a really exciting prospect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These materials can 'sense' when something is wrong in the body and respond by delivering treatment right where it's needed," said first author Dr. Stephen O'Neill. "This could reduce the need for repeated doses of drugs, while improving patient quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+delivery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug delivery&lt;/a&gt; systems that require external triggers such as heat or light, this one is powered by the body's own chemistry. The researchers say this could pave the way for longer-lasting, targeted arthritis treatments that automatically respond to flareups, boosting effectiveness while reducing harmful side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/laboratory+tests/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;laboratory tests&lt;/a&gt;, researchers loaded the material with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fluorescent+dye/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fluorescent dye&lt;/a&gt; to mimic how a real drug might behave. They found that at acidity levels typical of an arthritic joint, the material released substantially more drug cargo compared with normal, healthy pH levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By tuning the chemistry of these gels, we can make them highly sensitive to the subtle shifts in acidity that occur in inflamed tissue," said co-author Dr. Jade McCune. "That means drugs are released when and where they are needed most."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the approach could be tailored to a range of medical conditions, by fine-tuning the chemistry of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a highly flexible approach, so we could, in theory, incorporate both fast-acting and slow-acting drugs, and have a single treatment that lasts for days, weeks or even months," said O'Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's next steps will involve testing the materials in living systems to evaluate their performance and safety in a physiological environment. The team says that if it is successful, their approach could open the door to a new generation of responsive biomaterials capable of treating chronic diseases with greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;
