    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Josh Green is the governor of Hawaii. Before being elected governor in 2022, he worked as an emergency room doctor and family physician in Hawaii for over 20 years. While serving as lieutenant governor, he led an emergency medical mission to help stop the measles epidemic in Samoa and led Hawaii’s vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic, ranked as one of the most effective in the nation.
&lt;/p&gt;

            America’s children are in danger. Measles outbreaks are spreading in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and beyond, threatening lives, overwhelming health-care resources and exposing vulnerable communities. Texas alone has confirmed more than 400 measles cases and the death of the first child from measles in our country in more than a decade: the heartbreaking loss of a school-age child in Gaines County. The outbreaks continue to spread, gaining momentum and posing a threat to children across our country — with one public health official in Texas fearing that the outbreak there could last an entire year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00053b6o0id41wws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But this tragic outcome we can see coming doesn’t have to happen. We can prevent it if we act now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00063b6okh2wny1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an extremely contagious virus that hospitalizes as many as 1 in 5 of those it infects and kills 1 in every 1,000. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw hundreds of thousands of cases every year, many resulting in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00073b6o3q7s3aq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twenty-five years ago, nationwide vaccination efforts had virtually eliminated the disease in the United States by achieving vaccination rates of 95% across the country, establishing herd immunity and preventing the disease from spreading. Today, vaccination rates have been allowed to fall in many states. Experts fear that the elimination of the disease is at risk and that measles may again become a threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00083b6oyn5rtp9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination campaigns save lives during outbreaks of deadly viruses. I have witnessed the lifesaving power of vaccines firsthand. During the Covid-19 pandemic – when I was serving as lieutenant governor – we vaccinated over a million people in Hawaii, saving thousands of lives and achieving the lowest infection and mortality rates in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk00093b6opxhemb54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, a measles outbreak swept through the island nation of Samoa. The spread of antivaccine misinformation in the previous year had caused fear and uncertainty, which kept many families from vaccinating their children against measles. The result was a devastating outbreak that infected more than 5,000 people and killed 83, mostly children. In December of 2019, I led an emergency medical mission from Hawaii to vaccinate 37,000 people in Samoa over 36 hours, rapidly raising the vaccination rate and helping to end the deadly outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000a3b6o3bfz2iyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from October, there are 14 states in the US where measles vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen to dangerously low levels under 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000b3b6ojj4r9tlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Communities with vaccination rates below the 95% threshold necessary to maintain herd immunity become fertile ground for measles outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, almost 1 in 5 kindergartners entering the school system is unvaccinated against measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000c3b6ookv6sbbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000d3b6ouhggcpsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also continues to cloud these facts by describing vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoting vitamin A supplementation as a primary response to the measles outbreak. Let me be clear: Vitamin A may lessen measles complications once infection has occurred, but it does not prevent the disease. To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000e3b6ocukg67q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000f3b6oykdv4a0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000g3b6o55d1fjyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000h3b6oe0rdaogp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000i3b6og6ea5feo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000j3b6or9nngdxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000k3b6obum1gjgw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000l3b6o48nwqdcf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dqu39002j3572okzr07zz@published"&gt;While I was dating my college boyfriend, my sister started to date his brother. My relationship started getting rocky, and I had a choice between starting a new job in a different city or working on my relationship. My boyfriend was adamant that I not take the job and stay here with him. I made the mistake of staying. We broke up a year later because I found him cheating on me. My sister was still dating his brother and they ended up engaged. It was very difficult for me to be around my sister and her fiancé. After they got married, holidays were even worse. I struggled but moved on. Well, several years later, they are in the process of getting a divorce. And my brother-in-law just decided to nuke my relationship with my sister by sending me a taunting text containing a major shock.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dodx2004jr7m7ge3bis67@published"&gt;In it, he revealed his brother had been cheating on me a long time before I found out, and my sister knew all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ep002o3572jg5t7554@published"&gt;I called my sister in tears and she confessed. I screamed at her. She was the one that encouraged me to stay and skip my chance at a new job. I called her a selfish whore and said that I considered her dead to me now. In the aftermath, our parents are more upset at me for adding more stress to my sister than about what happened to me. They say it was years ago and that I am overreacting. This has me so sick that my doctor put me on anxiety medication. I don’t know how to go on from here.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not fair that your boyfriend cheated on you, and it’s even worse that your brother-in-law went out of his way to hurt you on his way out the door. I’ll be transparent about my agenda here: I don’t want this story to end with the two bad guy exes living happily ever after and enjoying each other’s company while you and you and your sister have to cope without each other. You say “My BIL decided to nuke my relationship with my sister” —but his whole plan fails if you don’t let him do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="224" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002s357292jmy4mx@published"&gt;Also, totally separate from my desire for a narrative in which the terrible men don’t come out on top, I think your relationship with your sister is worth saving. Yes, it’s fair to be upset with her, to wish she’d made a different choice with regard to telling you about the cheating, and to need some time to get over it. But her behavior doesn’t rise to “selfish whore who is dead to me” levels. People often write to me often asking for advice on whether to tell a loved one that their partner is being unfaithful. It’s a common dilemma because this is a situation in which it’s really hard to know what the victim of infidelity would want. While some are grateful for the intel, plenty of others become outraged at the deliverer of bad news. I’ve made the case before that when there is cheating, there are almost always clues and that person in the relationship could pursue if they truly wanted to know, so there’s no obligation to inform them. But whether to speak up is a legitimately tough call—one about which good, kind people can disagree. Sometimes I think we should get ahead of the issue by giving our friends and family instructions about whether we’d want to be informed if they ever suspected that our partners were cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7et002t3572pd02myan@published"&gt;What you’re experiencing is real pain and distress, and I would never agree that you’re overreacting or that the time that’s passed means you should be over it. But I suspect your response might be more about how much being cheated on all those years ago hurt you—and your shame over making a “mistake”— and less about what your sister knew and when. I hope the anti-anxiety medication is helping, and I wonder if it will give you the mental space to process what happened in your relationship, why you made the choice you did, and how you can forgive yourself for staying in a city with a guy who turned out not to be worth it. That’s a totally understandable (and extremely common) decision. And it’s worth noting that it did not ruin your life. I hope you can make peace with it and see it as part of your journey rather than something that derailed you completely. If you can do that, you may begin to see your sister is also someone who has made missteps but isn’t defined by them, and perhaps the two of you can figure out your next steps together.&lt;/p&gt;

A new neighbor came and was upset that I “touched his laundry and didn’t wait for him.” I thought maybe he didn’t realize normal etiquette and that I use a cane. He was still demanding an apology. I said write a note to the board. I refrained from saying he had poor manners. I don’t feel obligated to teach a grown, able man what entitlement is. Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev002z35722ucb2jl6@published"&gt;Your neighbor should know that if you use shared laundry facilities and don’t want anyone to touch your clothes, you need to either bring some work or entertainment and set up shop in the laundry room so you’re there when each load is done, or implement a very good alarm system to remind you to run down and grab your stuff. (If you’re waiting for a machine, it’s considerate to give the current user maybe five minutes after the buzzer to show up, but no longer.) That’s the rule! And even if he’s truly confused about how this works, he should have extended some empathy to you and the fact that you can’t comfortably stand around waiting for people to remember that they’re washing clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00303572m73qi66x@published"&gt;You were right and he was wrong. But forget the lesson on manners and entitlement. In the same way that we all have to be responsible for our own clothes and not our neighbors, his bad personality is his business, and it’s not your job to provide guidance on how to be a considerate human being. “Write a note to the board” (a polite way of saying “Take it up with someone who cares, and by the way, they’re not going to be on your side”) was the perfect response, and you should use it again if you find yourself in this situation in the future. But I suspect your neighbor’s horror at having his wet clothes touched might have been the reminder he needed to time his loads better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00333572y8knb4qg@published"&gt;I come to you fresh out of a nearly year-long relationship. I started dating “B” just shortly after coming out, and he was my first relationship. Things were peachy, save for a few disagreements here and there. When I say I’m fresh out of this relationship, it’s more “raw” than “minty.” It wasn’t my decision. My boyfriend, after months of sharing our personalities, time, and baggage, told me that his anxiety was making our relationship “suffocating” and that he would need to move on to take better care of his mental health. I had known about his anxiety and worked to foster an environment where he could feel honest about how he’s feeling and share whatever he felt comfortable with. The problem, however, is that he still held back. He said that he tried to sweep it under the rug throughout our relationship, but the kettle was boiling and he just couldn’t ignore the whistle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex003435727g0md1y3@published"&gt;The shock hit me like a silver bullet. How could the man I love decide to stumble out of a relationship rather than grant me the opportunity to talk though his pain? How do I even know if his intention to seek help was genuine? Was it really his anxiety that suffocated our relationship, or was it me? These questions and any number like them still own my mind over a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex00353572vr6bmmt3@published"&gt;Now, we’re no-contact and according to what little information I have available (through social media), he’s positively enjoying his relationship-free life. He leaves no sign of the anxiety that reportedly damned our relationship, and he certainly doesn’t let it get in the way of clubbing, concerts, and other fun outings. Is he just sweeping it under the rug again? Is there any hope of us reconnecting? And, if there is, will I just end up getting burned again?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex00363572wodwu6rw@published"&gt;—Cloistered in Chicago&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey003735729burs7o8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Cloistered, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00383572xlpy5c5n@published"&gt;Sure, there’s hope that you might reconnect. People break up and make up all the time. But I encourage you not to pursue that. Block him on Instagram, and consider the relationship over. Forever. This advice is based on a few rules that I think apply to your situation:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00393572itbf2s62@published"&gt;- No-contact should include no following on social media (which, by the way, doesn’t provide an accurate representation of anyone’s mood or mental state).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003a35723t9o9gna@published"&gt;- People are allowed to break up with you with no due process, for reasons that aren’t fair or honest or don’t make sense or are based on their own weird stuff and poor choices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003b3572s70tbdra@published"&gt;- It’s a bad idea to chase someone who doesn’t want you.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003c3572gnao4a6f@published"&gt;I know it’s not as simple as simply deciding to be done, and when someone doesn’t hold up their end of the relationship or share their true feelings, it can feel disorienting, and even like an injustice. You’re allowed to hate the way things turned out between the two of you and be frustrated that he didn’t work harder to address his mental health and nurture his connection with you at the same time. Rant about it to your friends, invite them to rant about it back to you, journal, scream—do whatever you need to. Except trying to reconnect with him. Instead, try to tap into the part of you that was eager to be in an open, supportive, healthy relationship and start to think about looking for someone who wants the same and is willing to work as hard as you are to make it happen. After all, if you were so invested in a relationship with a guy who found it suffocating, imagine how much better it will be when you find someone for whom being your partner is &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7f1003e35729amimfwa@published"&gt;My fiancé and I broke up a month ago after four years together because he changed his mind about having kids in the near future and wanted to be polyamorous with me and his new crush. I really do not want to be poly, and having kids in a few years (I’m 28 now, he is 30) is really important to me. But I feel regret and wonder if I should get back together with him and if this is just a big struggle we have to overcome. He is dating his crush already, and she is poly. Since he met her, he is convinced that being poly is the thing that will make him happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/dear-prudence-sexist-demand.html"&gt;Should I try to fight for us? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We could call room service when hungry and spend the day admiring the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was tempting, but we headed downstairs to explore the spa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we considered never leaving the suite, exiting the spa was even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the 21,500-square-foot spa was the most impressive pool I've ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the pool had views of the Dolomites. Half of it was indoors, and the other was outdoors. Guests could swim between the two through sliding glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area also had loungers, daybeds, a water station with small snacks, a sauna, and a steam room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallway led to another wing of the spa, which had two more indoor saunas, one at 185 degrees Fahrenheit and another at 158 degrees. There was a cold plunge, a silent room with a fireplace, and a tea lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A door led outdoors to the fifth sauna, which was tucked inside a traditional South Tyrolean wooden house, and a second outdoor cold plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While access to these amenities is included in the stay, the property's spa also offers treatments like massages, facials, scrubs, and manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When she saw photos of the characteristic red rash on practice board exams, she flipped back through her textbooks to figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Most practicing doctors, in today’s day and age, are not going to see it in real life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in the past few months, Dr. Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, has treated about 20 people with measles. She is likely to see more cases, as a raging outbreak that has infected 481 people in Texas and killed one child continues to spread. In Texas, New Mexico and other parts of the country where cases have emerged,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;health care workers like Dr. Myrick are confronting the highly contagious virus for the first time. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported 607 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. this year — more than double the number of cases seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The generation of physicians who are currently, for the most part, treating patients haven’t actually seen what a measles case looks like other than from a textbook or a video,” said Dr. Andy Lubell, chief medical officer of True North Pediatrics in Pennsylvania, where a physician diagnosed the practice’s first ever measles case this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000. Cases still pop up around the country each year, sometimes seeding larger outbreaks. But public health experts worry that this year, measles could become &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/health/measles-outbreak-texas.html" title=""&gt;more common in more places.&lt;/a&gt; The virus is spreading rapidly in some parts of the country, and vaccination rates nationwide have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" title=""&gt;been falling for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I remember learning about measles, German measles, all these things,” said Dr. Seth Coombs, a doctor at the Lovington Medical Clinic in New Mexico who saw his first measles case this year. “But you just don’t see them. And so like anything, if you don’t use it, you lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can sometimes be hard to recognize at first, especially if a doctor doesn’t think to look for it. The infection causes a telltale red rash, but it can take days to appear.

All the drinks were cherry flavoured, so the participants did not notice the difference, and each of them was exercising their own control over the consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of the drinks was random for the participants, with the gap between the sessions ranging from two days to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that artificial sweeteners are effective for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resulted in an increased blood flow to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps control the appetite and cravings. However, when the same participants drank a beverage containing sucrose, also known as table sugar, there was a hunger-decreasing effect. The peripheral glucose levels spiked, and this corresponded with reduced blood flow to the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hours after consuming sucrose, participants reported significantly lower hunger levels than when they consumed sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the research suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may not actually be useful for losing weight or reducing the cravings for sugar. Additionally, they seem to change how the hypothalamus communicates with the rest of the brain. A similar &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0031717" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; was carried out on male and obesity-prone female rats, and the results were similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sucrose but with zero calories. However, it creates a "mismatch between the expectation of caloric intake and the absence of actual energy," explained the authors of the study. "If your body is expecting a calorie because of the sweetness, but doesn't get the calorie it's expecting, that could change the way the brain is primed to crave those substances over time," warned Kathleen Alanna Page, a supervisor of the study and endocrinologist from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of American adults regularly consume these sugar substitutes, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31395-8/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, unaware of their ironical effects.

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Common symptoms of measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from Tarrant County Public Health, Great Wolf Lodge and the Texas Department of State Health Services update on Friday, April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 03:11:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1mMTV2LURWOFREc1dfNm5hOVZUY0pjWDhMR1E4NDNaLXRfZmdySy1VaUR5ZUcxQWdxODNRdU9udmNuWGw2S3cyNk9rUDYyckYxYndzOElFc0x6bWszVmFEVVVaZ9IBaEFVX3lxTE5YTDRMSjhna21MSFdEMHctS1lfbmlCVWNoRlcwMjJtc0VoZVBFellWNWE1ckc1ci1GTkI5aEdnWk1rT2FMbkEydW1iZHEtWHNIR0xhS2RuUFpEZi1qemozelZlRkVOUVNL</guid></item><item><title>Multivitamin to magnesium: 3 most common vitamin supplements that can land us in danger - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to stay healthy, and taking vitamin supplements might seem like a quick and easy way to fill the nutritional gaps. But here’s something surprising—not all supplements are as safe or helpful as they seem. In fact, some of the most common ones can silently mess with our gut health and leave us feeling worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gut is like the command center for our overall well-being. It’s not just about digestion—it also impacts our mood, immunity, and even our energy levels. But when certain synthetic supplements disrupt this delicate system, they can trigger problems you never expected. Here are 3 such vitamin supplements, as per Dr Janine Bowring, ND, a naturopathic doctor that we should watch out for and what you can do instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Synthetic multivitamins: A cocktail of trouble for our gut&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many over-the-counter multivitamins are synthetic. If you look at the ingredient list and see names like Vitamin A as Retinyl Palmitate or Vitamin B6 as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, that’s your red flag. These are lab-made versions, not the kind your body naturally gets from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which do you believe is better for gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These synthetic forms can irritate your gut lining, disturb the balance of good bacteria, and in some cases, even overload your liver over time. They’re harder for the body to break down, which means instead of absorbing nutrients, your body ends up struggling to detox them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What you can do instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go for whole food-based multivitamins. These are made from concentrated food sources and are much gentler on your digestive system. Even better, try to get most of your vitamins from real foods like leafy greens, fruits, seeds, and nuts. Nature does it best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12: A sneaky gut irritant&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is essential for energy and nerve health—but here’s the catch. If our supplement label says cyanocobalamin, it’s a synthetic version that contains a tiny amount of cyanide. While the dose is low, regular intake can affect detox pathways and may irritate our gut and liver, especially if our body is already under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop there. People with gut issues like IBS or low stomach acid may not even absorb this form of B12 properly, so it just adds to the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to choose instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always look for methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin—these are more natural, bioavailable forms of B12. Also, try to include more B12-rich foods like eggs, dairy, and fish in our diet. Fermented foods like curd can also help with gut health while improving B12 absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It sounds harmless, but it can be a silent disruptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305453403_Delay_effect_of_magnesium_stearate_on_tablet_dissolution_in_acidic_medium" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggest that magnesium stearate can create a biofilm in the gut, which prevents proper nutrient absorption. It may also reduce the effectiveness of probiotics and harm the gut’s protective barrier over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s a better choice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for supplements without fillers or additives like magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, or artificial colors. Brands that say “clean label” or “additive-free” are a safer bet. Again, choosing nutrients from whole foods is the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;The Importance of a Strong Digestive Fire for Holistic Health in Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to fall into the supplement trap, especially with the attractive labels and tall claims. But your gut health is too precious to risk. Just because something is labeled as a “vitamin” doesn’t mean it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always read the labels, question what's inside, and when in doubt, choose food over pills. If you’re unsure, speak to a qualified nutritionist or functional medicine expert to figure out what your body truly needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, less is more—and a clean, nutrient-rich diet can give you far better results than a shelf full of synthetic supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg</guid></item><item><title>5 nurses who work on the same floor at Massachusetts hospital have brain tumors - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPd1EyajhKRVNrQndzbWh3SjhwdGNqcUllSEFCLUdhS3BLUTV6alFhNTROcGRVUkpPOHRUMlNFNEg4cFJNMFFwdGdMcllrQ1lrS25uNVFJa0Q4OGFRalhaS3RJT2NKLUdUVjMyWk9DWUNuWVpMWS1MTXdtQzJTVFhmQTBVOUdjWXhrQjY0QjNrZzIyZzF3OW5HZ1BSaW9yTTlrZEYyNE9R0gFWQVVfeXFMTmthaWl1S3VlVENua2JKb2pqNl9lQ1FBbDd5d3NTSkpUNlkzcV9zcThsYnM4T2hHdzlZZV9nUjdTXzhBWF91T2FqaW1fWk9PbVpuR3dSUHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns.

	&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For a child who is not vaccinated against measles — one of the world’s most infectious viruses — no classroom, school bus or grocery store is safe. Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people exposed to an infected person will catch it, and once measles takes root, the virus can damage the lungs, kidneys and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;falling U.S. vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; that have caused more than 580 cases and at least one death, health experts expect measles to infect hundreds or even thousands more across the nation. Here is how measles takes over the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Unlike viruses that require person-to-person contact, &lt;strong&gt;measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; lingers in the air &lt;/strong&gt;for up to two hours after the person carrying it has left the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-center svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Droplets are enlarged for illustration purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;A child can inhale virus-containing droplets in a room where another child — unknowingly infected with measles — has been studying or playing an hour earlier. The virus can enter her body through the lining of her nose or mouth, or when she’s rubbing her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;During the subsequent 24 hours, &lt;strong&gt;the virus takes root&lt;/strong&gt; by lodging in her nasopharynx cells in the upper part of the throat and starts spreading to her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Then, &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he virus takes over&lt;/strong&gt;, multiplying inside the cells and building up an army for an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper g-linebefore svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper g-linebefore svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Within a few days, the virus begins to spread to infect the nearby lymphoid tissues. About a week after the initial exposure, infected cells begin traveling to other organs throughout the body. (At this time, the immune system of a vaccinated child would recognize the virus and fight it off.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Typically, during the replication and spread of the virus, the child does not feel sick. The average incubation period is about two weeks — though it can range from one to three. When the viral load has increased significantly, it moves to infect other cells of the lungs and eyes, making the child feel ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;A couple of weeks after the unvaccinated child inhales the droplets, &lt;strong&gt;she starts feeling sick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Children often first show signs of malaise and a fever, followed later by reddish, irritated eyes, a cough and a stuffy nose as the mucus membranes and nasal passages become inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Some children at this stage develop millimeter-wide, whitish-gray bumps on the inner lining of the cheeks, as far back as the molars. For some, the spots go undetected, or do not show up at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Then comes the characteristic feature: the breakout of a red rash, starting on the face and spreading down the neck, trunk, and extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Many of these symptoms should resolve themselves. The rash can last up to a week, often fading along the same route it appeared. The cough can last for up to two weeks after the illness has resolved. But a fever lasting beyond the third or fourth day of the rash suggests that a complication could be developing — and that is where cases can become dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Even as the rash fades, the infection can spread to the lungs and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Children are typically brought to the hospital after having the body rash for several days. Most have low oxygen levels and are laboring to breathe and need support, said Dr. Summer Davies, who sees children at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, and has been treating measles cases there since the outbreak started in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;“A lot of families have kind of been surprised, like, ‘Oh, my child was fine, and then all of a sudden, they're not,’ ” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;That mild disease evolves into a fever as high as 104 or 105 degrees for two, three or four days. Poor fluid intake, a sore throat and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which over time can begin to threaten kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Young children are more at risk because of their smaller anatomy and their inability to articulate symptoms clearly, explained Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer of a group of Covenant hospitals in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;About one in 20 children with measles will develop &lt;strong&gt;pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt;, an infection in the lungs; and severe cases can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Dr. Davies said many children admitted to her hospital recently had cases of pneumonia caused by either the measles virus or by a second pathogen that attacked while their immune systems were weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The 6-year-old girl &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;who recently died of measles&lt;/a&gt; in Texas had a case of pneumonia that caused fluid to build up in her left lung, making it difficult for her to breathe, according to a video interview with her parents that was posted online. She was eventually sedated and intubated, but she became too sick to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;One of the hallmarks of measles is what researchers call “immune amnesia,” the temporary weakening of the immune system. Measles wipes the protection children have acquired from other infections, which leaves them susceptible to other infections for several months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;  &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n "&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_main-content svelte-dk6paf g-overflow-visible"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_main_content_slot svelte-dk6paf"&gt;&lt;div class="g-visualsGraph svelte-koeu3o"&gt;&lt;p class="g-time svelte-koeu3o"&gt;Inflammation in the brain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;About one in 1,000 children who contract measles will also develop &lt;strong&gt;encephalitis&lt;/strong&gt;, or inflammation of the brain tissue, which can result in permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For infants or children who are already immunocompromised, a condition called measles inclusion body encephalitis (or MIBE) occurs when the child cannot clear the infection. It can trigger mental changes and seizures, leading to a coma and death in most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Another type, called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), is a degenerative condition that can occur up to a decade after a measles infection. Children often first show signs of behavior change and academic decline, followed by seizures, motor issues like poor coordination and balance, and eventually death. The mortality rate approaches 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Erica Finkelstein-Parker, a mother in Pennsylvania who lost her 8-year-old child Emmalee to the condition, had not known that the girl had had measles before she had been adopted from India as a toddler. But she noticed one day that Emmalee was tripping and falling, slumping over to one side of her chair and struggling to lift her chin off her chest during dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Doctors explained that there was no cure. Emmalee passed away about five months later.&lt;/p&gt;

Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation. Messick said she’s not been given clear guidance on how to handle measles in such a large day care with so many vulnerable kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“From what I’m being told, the CDC doesn’t have a playbook for this,” Messick said. “We’ve just had to make judgment calls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;an alert to doctors&lt;/a&gt; last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311" target="_blank"&gt;two large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened to reverse the United States’ status of having eliminated the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;steep funding cuts to community health departments&lt;/a&gt; announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144" target="_blank"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cases at the Lubbock day care center are likely linked to the epicenter of the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, said Lubbock's public health director Katherine Wells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wells said she’s been concerned about cases spreading in child care centers since the beginning of the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think we’ll have additional outbreaks in other day care centers,” she said. “This isn’t going to be the only one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Messick, of the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, said she and her staff are trying to reduce risk of further spread by watching kids closely for symptoms and isolating certain classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They’re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus are almost certain to become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The first dose isn’t usually given until after a child’s first birthday, but can be offered early, at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“That’s the best that child care owners can do right now,” Messick said. “It’s coming. There’s no way around it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 22:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPNHVyREJrMXdOcnM2QkozTXBDdm1ydGNGMERRa1lyWjFuLTV2Y2pBcTlSbWFqZTd0SEx6ZHR6NFRSZXpaZkNjNUVzRURUMUN0SDRXUE0xa0k3S1A3empiVF9qOGs1YkFUNV8zQ3pxdFNPREtsd1owcjZJczVyc2ljaDBVczJZY2l5QXVRdE0ydFJRWnlPa3BGeG1EQXVBYjV2X3fSAVZBVV95cUxOLUExMm4tOWlpUW1QS3lRdC1YblhCemY4SzdoOExBV2lkQVd4bHdFaEVwckRIcFJad2N0elJvbTFUMnNmOFZ5eEhPNGVmcnRKWmF6OXlEUQ</guid></item><item><title>Female Hormones Trigger Pain Relief via Immune Cells - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5MdUxrM1gyQ180eU85cmpJeXNhaVE5RTZDQnhpOUFBVDJsN011X1E4M2N2dGJFdTc0M09yTEZFdjhlc0ZrOVo5RExVNzVDYjRPcEZ4RU15aUV1cUstcmpqTTJ3VWJYdWE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have discovered that female hormones like estrogen and progesterone can trigger immune cells near the spinal cord to release natural opioids, easing pain before it reaches the brain. These immune cells, known as T regulatory cells (T-regs), are located in the meninges and produce the painkilling molecule enkephalin in response to hormonal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect appears specific to females, offering insight into why some pain treatments work better for women and why postmenopausal women may experience more chronic pain. This newly uncovered mechanism could lead to sex-specific therapies and innovative treatments for the millions affected by chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Driven Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen and progesterone prompt T-regs to release natural opioids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Female mice without T-regs became more pain-sensitive; males did not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Engineered T-regs may offer a new approach for chronic pain relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that acts via an immune cell and points toward a different way of treating chronic pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female hormones can suppress pain by making immune cells near the spinal cord produce opioids, a new study from researchers at UC San Francisco has found. This stops pain signals before they get to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could help with developing new treatments for chronic pain. It may also explain why some painkillers work better for women than men and why postmenopausal women experience more pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108393"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work reveals an entirely new role for T regulatory immune cells (T-regs), which are known for their ability to reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there’s a sex-dependent influence on these cells – driven by estrogen and progesterone – and that it’s not related at all to any immune function is very unusual,” said Elora Midavaine, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow. She is the first author of the study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears April 4 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at T-regs in the protective layers that encase the brain and spinal cord in mice. Until now, scientists thought these tissues, called the meninges, only served to protect the central nervous system and eliminate waste. T-regs were only discovered there in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we are showing now is that the immune system actually uses the meninges to communicate with distant neurons that detect sensation on the skin,” said Sakeen Kashem, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is something we hadn’t known before.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That communication begins when a neuron, often near the skin, senses something that could cause pain. The neuron then sends a signal to the spinal cord.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the meninges surrounding the lower part of the spinal cord harbor an abundance of T-regs. To learn what their function was, the researchers knocked the cells out with a toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was striking: Without the T-regs, female mice became more sensitive to pain, while male mice did not. This sex-specific difference suggested that female mice rely more on T-regs to manage pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was both fascinating and puzzling,” said Kashem, who co-led the study with Allan Basbaum, PhD. “It actually made me skeptical initially.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed a relationship between T-regs and female hormones that no one had seen before: Estrogen and progesterone were prompting the cells to churn out painkilling enkephalin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the hormones do this is a question the team hopes to answer in a future study. But even without that understanding, the awareness of this sex-dependent pathway is likely to lead to much-needed new approaches for treating pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short run, it may help physicians choose medications that could be more effective for a patient, depending on their sex. Certain migraine treatments, for example, are known to work better on women than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be particularly helpful for women who have gone through menopause and no longer produce estrogen and progesterone, many of whom experience chronic pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that approach is successful, it could really change the lives of the nearly 20% of Americans who experience chronic pain that is not adequately treated,” Basbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors on the study include Beatriz Moraes, Jorge Benitez, Sian Rodriguez, Joao Braz, Nathan Kochhar and Walter Eckalbar of UCSF, Lin Tian of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, Ana Domingos of University of Oxford and John E.

&lt;p&gt;Experiencing Cloudflare’s “Attention Required!” message can be frustrating when trying to access leboudoirdubienetre.fr. This security feature, while protecting websites from potential threats, sometimes blocks legitimate users. Understanding why this happens and knowing how to resolve these access issues can save you time and restore your browsing experience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;Understanding Cloudflare security alerts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare serves as a protective shield for many websites including leboudoirdubienetre.fr. When you encounter an “Attention Required!” notification, it means the security system has identified your action as potentially suspicious. This doesn’t necessarily indicate malicious intent on your part – even routine browsing activities can sometimes trigger these alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-328903103"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security system analyzes visitor behavior patterns to detect possible threats. Actions that might trigger the security mechanism include submitting certain keywords, phrases that resemble SQL commands, or data in unexpected formats. Even browsing patterns that appear automated can activate these protective measures, temporarily restricting your access to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/03/this-little-known-leafy-vegetable-is-actually-the-secret-to-youth-among-the-japanese-and-koreans/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;This little-known leafy vegetable is actually the secret to youth among the Japanese and Koreans.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These security protocols represent part of a broader strategy for maintaining website integrity. Just as &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/at-24-she-reveals-how-she-saved-90000-to-retire-by-40/"&gt;financial planning requires protective measures&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard assets, websites implement these barriers to protect their digital infrastructure from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-389191795"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding that these blocks are automated rather than personal can help reduce frustration when encountering them. The system operates on predefined security rules without human intervention in most cases, which occasionally results in false positives.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Common triggers for security blocks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several factors can trigger Cloudflare’s security mechanisms when attempting to access leboudoirdubienetre.fr. Identifying what might have caused the block can help you avoid similar issues in the future. Security systems often flag activities that deviate from typical user behavior patterns.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific phrases or keywords within your search queries or form submissions may activate security alerts. The system monitors for expressions commonly associated with hacking attempts or automated scraping tools. Similarly, any input resembling database commands will immediately trigger protective measures, as these often indicate potential SQL injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/26/the-worlds-richest-youtuber-mrbeast-says-anyone-would-be-unhappy-living-the-lifestyle-he-has/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;The world’s richest YouTuber, MrBeast, says anyone would be “unhappy” living the lifestyle he has.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapid page requests or browsing multiple pages quickly can appear suspicious to security algorithms. The system may interpret this behavior as bot activity rather than human browsing. Even using certain browser extensions or VPN services can sometimes trigger these security responses.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your IP address history also plays a role in determining access permissions. If your network has previously been associated with suspicious activities, even unrelated to your personal actions, you might face additional scrutiny. This shared responsibility approach to network security resembles how &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/02/this-is-the-exact-amount-of-exercise-you-need-per-week-to-effectively-lose-weight/"&gt;consistent exercise habits contribute to overall health goals&lt;/a&gt; – both require ongoing vigilance and proper practices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Steps to resolve access restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When faced with the “Attention Required!” message on leboudoirdubienetre.fr, several practical solutions can help restore your access quickly. The most direct approach involves communicating with the website administrators about the issue you’re experiencing.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the site owner via email to explain the situation. Include detailed information about what you were doing when the block occurred. This context helps them determine whether the security system responded appropriately or if adjustments are needed. Remember to include the Cloudflare Ray ID displayed at the bottom of the error page, as this specific identifier helps administrators trace exactly what triggered the security response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/20/a-nutritionist-reveals-the-exact-amount-of-dark-chocolate-to-eat-daily-to-reap-its-benefits/"&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While waiting for a response, try some basic troubleshooting steps. Clear your browser cookies and cache, which might remove any data patterns that triggered the security alert. Switching to a different browser or disabling browser extensions can also help determine if these factors contributed to the block.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a VPN service, temporarily disabling it might resolve the issue. Security systems sometimes flag traffic from VPN servers due to their shared nature and previous user activities. Waiting a short period before attempting to access the site again can also be effective, as temporary blocks often reset automatically after a cooling-off period.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Preventive measures for smooth website access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your chances of encountering Cloudflare security blocks when visiting leboudoirdubienetre.fr or similar protected websites. Implementing these practices helps establish your browsing activities as legitimate and trustworthy to security systems.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable cookies for websites you regularly visit. Security systems often use cookies to distinguish between legitimate users and potential threats. Blocking cookies might prevent the site from recognizing you as a returning visitor, potentially triggering security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/10/better-than-nordic-walking-this-grandpa-sport-is-perfect-for-burning-fat-with-minimal-effort/"&gt;

Two of the nurses had the same type of tumor, a meningioma, and the other three had different types of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As part of the hospital's investigation, 11 staff members came forward to be interviewed, including the five nurses diagnosed with brain tumors and six others with unspecified “health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor," the hospital said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another investigation led by the Massachusetts Nurses Association is ongoing, the group tells TODAY.com. A spokesperson said they have been contacted by over 300 people, mostly current and former employees at the hospital, regarding the investigation. The group expects the investigation may "additional weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses and their environmental testing was not comprehensive," the association's statement read in part. "While we currently cannot release specific numbers or other diagnosis information, we are committed to being transparent about our findings when we have finished verifying the information we collect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Massachusetts Nurses Association's investigation is being conducted by the group's division of health and safety in collaboration with nurses working at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Newton-Wellesley Hospital's investigation was conducted with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, the Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices, and other health and environmental experts, per their statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors," the hospital statement said. "To evaluate for any possible environmental exposures in that area of the hospital, comprehensive environmental assessments following CDC guidelines began in December." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the hospital, the investigation included tests of the hospital's water and air quality. The facility's water is tested regularly, but additional testing results are still pending; air quality was found to be normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The investigation also examined levels of radiation around the fifth floor and the pharmacy's ventilation system, and looked at possible risks from X-ray use policies, construction, cleaning products, mold and pest control measures, and it found no issues, the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team members at Mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility," the hospital said in its statement.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Growing older can take a toll on your hearing, but even more than your age, a new study has revealed another biological factor that may influence how your ears respond to sound: your sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;international study&lt;/a&gt;, "women consistently exhibit higher sensitivity" to loud clicking noises at low, mid, and high frequencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ear is stimulated in this way, researchers found the hairs inside the cochlea of women were two decibels more sensitive, on average, than the cochlear hairs of men. While this may not be noticeable to an individual, it is measurable in a cochlear test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings provide "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt;" that the inner ears of women are more sensitive to sounds than the inner ears of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Age is a well-established factor in the decline of cochlear sensitivity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by evolutionary biologist Patricia Balaresque from Paul Sabatier University in France. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in our study, the effect of age is overshadowed by sex and environmental factors."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a click test called Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE), researchers analyzed the cochlear sensitivity of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 448 healthy participants from five different countries: Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa, and Uzbekistan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In all the analytical models the team ran, sex was the main biological factor explaining inter-individual differences in TEOAE results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Age came second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the authors turned to non-biological factors, they found where a person lived had a greater impact on their cochlear sensitivity than their age. Those who live in forest environments, for instance, tend to outperform those in high-altitude or urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/study-shows-women-can-hear-better-than-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Balaresque.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.412231"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicates that as males age, they lose their hearing twice as fast as their female counterparts, and that is especially true for higher frequency sounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0000000000002507"&gt;&lt;span&gt;still don't understand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; why that is. Some have proposed that men are exposed to more damaging noises in their lives, which could exacerbate age-related hearing loss, but these new results suggest sex differences in cochlear sensitivity cannot simply be explained by age or by environmental exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some previous studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.3037231"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that women exhibit subtle yet higher sensitivity on TEOAE tests when the click is at least above 2,000 hertz (Hz), while other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5038496"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_AJA-17-0106"&gt;&lt;span&gt;no differences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; between the sexes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This field of research remains relatively unexplored, but Balaresque and her colleagues have now put forward a few hypotheses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sex differences in cochlear sensitivity, they explain, could be due to hormone exposure during early-life development, possibly influencing how tiny hairs in the cochlea form, gather, and respond to sound. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Women also tend to perform better in other tests of hearing, which suggests they may have "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt;" inner &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; outer ear function compared to men. Whether that is due to cultural or biological factors needs more research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't really know why this might be, but given the detrimental effect of noise on overall health such as sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease, having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/study-shows-women-can-hear-better-than-men/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; evolutionary biologist Turi King from the University of Bath in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first detailed investigations of what influences the sensitivity of the human inner ear using a diverse cohort with a variety of ethnicities and languages considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robust sex-based differences the authors identified now need to be studied further. Identifying what drives hearing loss and noise tolerance will be essential when it comes to tailoring hearing &lt;span&gt;aids&lt;/span&gt; to diverse populations, the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The deaths — all occurring within the first few months of 2025 — mark an unusual spike in &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/what-is-hantavirus-the-infection-that-killed-20209371.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hantavirus &lt;/a&gt;activity and have raised alarm among public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A third case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), each of which has been fatal, is tragic and alarming,” said Dr. Tom Boo, a Mono County public health officer, in a &lt;a href="https://monocounty.ca.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/county_administration/page/34452/pr_mono_thirdhantavirus_4-3-25_final.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases occurred despite no major rodent infestations in the homes of the three deceased, all who lived and worked in Mammoth Lakes, the release said. In each case, health officials did find mice in the workplace, which they don’t consider to be unusual, though no definitive exposure site has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste,” Boo said, noting that these recent deaths did not involve the typical risk factors, such as cleaning enclosed spaces with visible droppings, that have previously been associated with infection. He said he’s also “worried” about the timing of the deaths since hantavirus cases usually come in late spring or summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is contracted by inhaling particles from the droppings, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice, a species common in the Eastern Sierra, the release said. The virus does not spread from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the California Department of Public Health, 93 state residents have been infected with hantavirus from 1980 through 2024, with 79 of those cases traced to specific exposure locations within California. Mono County has recorded 27 cases since 1993 — more than any other county in the state — including six involving visitors, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, nausea, and abdominal pain. A cough usually develops only later, and shortness of breath often signaling the onset of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The disease can progress rapidly, with death occurring within one to two days of respiratory decline in severe cases, and roughly one-third of infected individuals die, the Mono County release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness made national headlines earlier this year when Betsy Arakawa — the wife of actor Gene Hackman — died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home.

The World Health Organization said last week that cases in Mexico were linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2000 had been declared eliminated from the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outbreak in Texas began more than two months ago. State health officials said on Friday there were 59 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 481 across 19 counties – most of them in west Texas. The state also logged 14 new hospitalizations, for a total of 56 throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 65% of the Texas cases are in Gaines county, which has a population of 22,892, and where the virus stated spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county now has logged 315 cases since late January – just over 1% of the county’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 20:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB3RHpqbkRlYldYQkJZbTRMdU1kSlEyNmlXSTR4XzVjZ3pmdHM4MHo0eWVhOExfZzFTVUZTOHNPTEhaZWdEVFQ1YjhQS3V3R0dGNzdRZDlQbmt4VVJOS3c5elhZRlE4Y1Q5TWRCNmRaSWJnQzhkcnJZ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of Blueberries - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNSnpjX1VVTVJYVW9EX2VjQkwwQmF2cllybExVUncwdElYUEtUWWo3b1hMVVJhY2M2YTlVQnhhSVZKNHdHUUI2VE9vR3VOdG9pZzRqZFRDanVkeUtMYXR6SThGQV9hdmhNNUNSR2xaVnVpeFBYRmZQczhNV1JITDJYZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people are already aware that eating blueberries and other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-rich-vegetables-for-diabetes-8678207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; is a simple and effective way to support different aspects of our health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, which not only give them vibrant color but also support heart health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. These compounds improve blood vessel function, help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;balance cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and lower risks related to heart and metabolic diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a crucial role in overall health, can be positively influenced by the polyphenols in blueberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With so many older adults facing various health challenges, finding easy, non-invasive &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-foods-for-healthier-aging-8771219" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to improve their health&lt;/a&gt; is especially important. According to researchers, incorporating more blueberries into their diet is one promising approach for better health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; explored how the simple act of adding blueberry powder to the diet can impact gut bacteria and blood markers connected to heart health in older adults who are overweight or have obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having a better idea of what may happen when older adults simply &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-lemon-blueberry-dessert-recipes-11701396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more blueberries&lt;/a&gt; can help uncover new strategies to improve gut health and reduce the risk of heart-related issues with little effort.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, called The Blueberry Enhances Activity and Cognition Through Increased Vascular Efficiency (BEACTIVE) study, was a 12-week research trial that investigated how eating blueberries and exercising could benefit older adults' physical activity and brain health. The study included men and women over 60 years old who were not very active and had a body weight that ranged between overweight and moderately obese. Participants also needed to have normal heart rhythms and blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. People with certain health conditions, recent infections, or who were on specific medications were not included in the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 55 participants were selected and randomly divided into two groups. One group consumed a drink made from blueberry powder twice daily, while the other group consumed a similar-looking placebo drink. Both groups also followed an exercise routine. By the end of the study, 48 participants completed the program. The amount of blueberry powder consumed was a quantity equivalent to about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries each day, divided into two ¾ cup servings consumed with meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, participants' diets were analyzed to understand their nutrition and berry intake using online tools and questionnaires. To ensure a clear understanding of how the treatment worked, participants followed a two-week "washout" period before the study began, where they avoided eating berries, grapes, cherries and other foods high in specific nutrients found in berries. Every participant also wore a fitness tracker for a week to measure their daily steps, and they gradually increased their step count throughout the study, working towards being more active.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Key health indicators, such as heart and blood vessel function and blood pressure, were measured at the start and end of the study. Researchers also kept track of physical activity and reviewed diets monthly. Additionally, blood and stool samples were collected at the start and end of the study to analyze gut bacteria and other health-related factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking at cholesterol, fats and other important compounds in the blood after 12 weeks, researchers found that people taking the placebo powder experienced significantly lower total cholesterol, LDL (called “bad”) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. Markers for the number and size of LDL particles and a protein linked to cholesterol, ApoB, also significantly decreased. On the other hand, people taking blueberry powder had lower levels of total HDL particles (the "good" cholesterol) and a protein called ApoA-I linked to HDL. In other words, they experienced positive outcomes when it came to their heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing the two groups, additional differences were noted. For the group on blueberry powder, there were changes in specific cholesterol particle numbers and sizes, such as smaller LDL cholesterol particles in the fasting state and lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol and other markers after meals, known as the postprandial state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study shows how additions like blueberry powder can impact cholesterol and related blood markers differently compared to a placebo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also found that among the study subjects, eating a diet that included powdered blueberries led to an increase in a specific type of gut bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Coriobacteriales incertae sedis&lt;/em&gt;. This increase wasn’t seen in those who didn’t consume the blueberry powder. These bacteria are known to help break down and absorb beneficial compounds found in blueberries, suggesting that the body adapts to better digest the nutrients from blueberries when they are a regular part of the diet, per the study authors. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some important limitations to consider. One major one was the small size of the groups that had both gut microbiome data and advanced blood biomarker analysis. Since the sample size is so small, it limits the ability to generalize the findings to a broader population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors also note that while the placebo and treatment groups were well-matched in terms of age, gender, race and BMI, they noticed that the placebo group showed different responses, which could be due to participants changing their behavior because they knew they were part of a health study. This might explain some of the positive effects seen in the placebo group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth noting that this study was funded by the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those of us looking for ways to support our heart health, adding blueberries is a delicious and simple place to start. Whether it’s tossing a handful of fresh or frozen &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-lemon-blueberry-smoothie-8363288" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blueberries into a morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkling &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8026653/blueberry-baked-oatmeal/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;them on oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or enjoying them as a midday snack, these little berries pack a big punch when it comes to supporting heart and gut health. Knowing that such an easy swap can offer measurable benefits, especially for older adults or those looking to manage their cholesterol or improve their gut microbiota make up, makes incorporating blueberries into daily routines a no-brainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s particularly encouraging about this study is its emphasis on accessibility and minimal effort. Unlike drastic lifestyle overhauls or invasive health interventions, eating more blueberries is a scalable practice that can fit into nearly any diet. It’s also a great reminder that small, consistent dietary changes can yield meaningful health benefits over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights the impressive health benefits of adding blueberries to your diet, particularly for older adults aiming to support their heart and gut health. While more research is needed to fully understand the far-reaching implications, the evidence so far points to blueberries as a simple, enjoyable and fairly accessible way to improve overall well-being.

However, the study authors noted that there is limited data on which specific individuals within this age group were more likely to receive a vaccination.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;To further understand what aids or hinders RSV vaccine acceptance, researchers conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a multicenter surveillance network, Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY), that assessed individuals hospitalized with acute respiratory illness (ARI) from 26 US hospitals in 20 states.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;A total of 6746 hospitalized individuals 60 years and older were included in the analysis, with the median age of 73 years. Demographic and clinical information was collected from patient interviews and electronic medical records. Additionally, the study authors noted individuals’ addresses were converted into geocodes to determine the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for each individual.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Among the 6566 individuals who reported their race and ethnicity, 10.6% were Hispanic, 19.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 65.1% were non-Hispanic White, and 4.7% identified as other race and ethnicity. Of the total study population, 10.4% (700) had received an RSV vaccine, while the vast majority, 89.6% (6046), were unvaccinated.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The results demonstrated that among the 3219 unvaccinated individuals surveyed about RSV knowledge, 47.2% (1519 individuals) had either never heard of RSV or were uncertain about it, and 78.5% (2525 out of 3218) were unsure or believed they were ineligible for the RSV vaccine. Adjusted analyses revealed that being 75 years or older (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.23), male (ARR, 1.15), having pulmonary disease (ARR, 1.39) or immunocompromised status (ARR, 1.30), residing in areas with low or moderate SVI (ARR, 1.47 for both), and having more years of education were associated with a higher likelihood of RSV vaccination. However, further results revealed that RSV vaccination was less common among residents of long-term care facilities, those with Medicaid, and uninsured individuals.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The findings suggest that continuing to track vaccination rates in future seasons to examine if simpler guidelines, along with increased public awareness and better access to preventative care, will result in higher vaccination rates among older adults at risk of severe RSV.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;1.

						&lt;p&gt;A record 484 North Carolinians have died from the flu this year, and
that number will likely rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The number is the highest since the state
began reporting deaths in the 2008-2009 season. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Deaths always lag several weeks behind the peaks of the
infection,” explained Dr. David Weber with UNC Health. “People start getting sick
and that’s when they measure when they test positive or come through the emergency
department, that’s the number you see peaking in mid-February. Then they take
several days or weeks to get really sick and they come to the hospital. While
we save many people, some people then go on and have a downhill course with
complications related to the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flu.ncdhhs.gov/data.htm"&gt;North Carolina’s
flu history&lt;/a&gt; has seen many fluctuations, including overall case and death totals
and when the virus itself peaks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 2008-2009 flu season, 12 people had died
from the flu statewide. This season’s death toll is 3,933%
higher. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2024-2025 season, the highest death toll in a
single flu season was recorded in 2017-2018. 391 people died statewide that season.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; The highest number of
pediatric deaths -- deaths of people under the age of 18 -- was recorded during last flu season, with 16 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A review
of Immunization Registry records &lt;a href="https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/flu/figures/flu2324.pdf"&gt;showed that 75% of
those children were not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, according to
the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said the high case counts this year can largely be
attributed to fewer social distancing protocols and fewer vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Many people are not masking the way they did in previous
years during the height of the COVID pandemic,” he said. “Second, the number of
people getting flu vaccines – as with other vaccines like the measles vaccine –
has decreased.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The infectious diseases expert said a common reason people
don’t get vaccinated is based on myth. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest reason people don’t get their annual
flu shot is they don’t perceive themselves as at-risk for serious illness and
think, ‘Oh I’m 20 and can’t get severely ill,'” said Weber. “That’s not true.
People can get sick and die from flu at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor shared people often “minimize the benefits of a
flu shot and over-consider the safety concerns” when it comes to their annual
vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said he often equates vaccinations to wearing a
seatbelt. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Someone will say to me ‘I don’t want to wear a seatbelt
because I read about a car that got sideswiped and fell into a lake and the
seatbelt jammed and the person drowned.’ Has that happened? Yes. But for every
person where that’s happened, there are a thousand people walking around
healthy today because a seatbelt either saved their life or saved them from
severe injury,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccinations have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Reduce%20severity%20of%20illness&amp;amp;text=A%202021%20study%20showed%20that,with%20those%20who%20were%20unvaccinated."&gt;significantly
reduce risk of death and hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; due to serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber advised at-risk groups in particular to make a
plan to get their flu vaccine every year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with underlying disease, that puts them at risk of
severe case of flu -- heart disease, lung disease, a smoker, asthma, people with
diabetes -- I think anyone if you’re 6 months of age and breathing
should get a flu shot period,” Weber said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor emphasized the importance of flu vaccinations for
pregnant women and those aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While the flu vaccine is not perfect and is usually about
50-70% effective in preventing disease, it is actually much better at
preventing death than hospitalization,” said Weber. “It may not prevent
everyone from getting ill, but it does a pretty good job of keeping you from
dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked about future flu seasons, Weber said increasing
education and getting more people vaccinated is key. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Each year the flu virus drifts a little bit, so each year we
make up a new flu vaccine to counter those small changes. We look at what
happens in the southern hemisphere – which is their winter, our summer – and
that’s how companies decide what to put in the vaccine drugs,” Weber explained.
“Every 5-20 years, we have a big shift; we get a new flu strain that’s totally
different, and we get a pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber continued, “I can’t predict when there will be the
next flu pandemic, I can only tell you there will be a flu pandemic. It’s only
a matter of time based on what’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor theorized H5N1 could have the potential to cause
serious sickness in humans, if the virus mutates further. Since 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html#:~:text=Since%20April%202024%2C%2070%20human,H5N1)%20virus%2Dinfected%20poultry."&gt;70
human cases of bird flu have been reported in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“So far that particular strain of flu has not picked up the
characteristics that allow it go person-to-person, but that’s a big concern
that we could at any point – even this summer – have a pandemic that’s H5N1 for
which none of us have any immunity,” said Weber. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor said if the H5N1 virus does begin to jump from
human-to-human, a large spike in cases and bird-flu deaths would likely occur. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If it doesn’t happen this summer, it’s only a matter of
time before we see another flu pandemic,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;To be prepared, Weber said North Carolinians need be
willing to make vaccinations more of a priority moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We need to support the companies to make the best flu
vaccine with the most current strains, and we need to take the vaccine, which
most people do not,” he said. “Separate from that, we need to support our
public health colleagues. Federal, state and local governments need to be
prepared for yet another pandemic. I know we all have pandemic fatigue, and we
don’t want to think about another one, but much like hurricanes, we’re going to
have them and we need to be prepared as a society for how to deal with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said that anyone with flu-like symptoms -- a high fever, dry cough, sore throat, body aches or runny nose -- should take an at-home test or be tested in a
healthcare setting quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We do have therapies for flu, but the flu advances so quickly
that you really need to start the therapy ideally within two days,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;If your condition worsens, seek emergency care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

The CDC said 2 more jurisdictions reported cases this week, raising the total to 22—21 states and New York City. One more outbreak was reported, making six so far, and 93% of cases confirmed so far are part of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the total patients, 97% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination statuses, and 74 (12%) have been hospitalized. The nation is on track to pass the 1,274 cases reported in 2019, a year when a surge of measles activity threatened the nation's measles elimination status, which it earned in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Texas total climbs to 481 cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 59 more cases, pushing the state's total since January to 481 in 19 counties. Fourteen more people were hospitalized for their infections, bringing that total to 56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the state's total, 471 patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most cases are reported in Gaines County on the border with New Mexico, a few linked to the outbreak have been reported in counties in central Texas, including Brown and Erath counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new development, the Harris County Public Health (HCPH), home to Houston in the southeastern part of the state, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.harriscountytx.gov/Portals/hcph/Documents/Press_Releases/Measles_April2025.pdf?ver=JvpqCq8fZ7JL_3XlZjqBoQ%3d%3d"&gt;said it is investigating&lt;/a&gt; a confirmed measles case in a child who lives in the northwestern part of the county and has no travel history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCPH said the case was confirmed by a commercial lab and awaits secondary confirmation by the TDSHS. So far, it's not clear if the case is linked to the outbreak in west Texas. The case marks Harris County's first since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDH) &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; six more cases, raising the state's total to 54. The New Mexico outbreak is limited to two counties—Lea and Eddy— that border the Texas outbreak hot spot. Among the 54 patients, 48 were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma, another state with cases linked to the Texas outbreak, reported no new cases today, keeping its total at 10, which includes 8 confirmed and 2 probable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases rise in Tennessee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks are occurring in other states, though it’s not clear if all are linked to the Texas event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/news/2025/4/1/tennessee-department-of-health-confirms-three-additional-measles-cases.html"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that three more cases have been confirmed in middle Tennessee, bringing the state's total to four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the newly confirmed cases is linked to the first Tennessee case, which was confirmed on March 21, and the exposure source is unknown. The TDH added that no other details are available about the other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A supposed cure for measles is harming people in Texas. A children’s hospital in the area has reported that several children treated for measles have also developed vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the phenomenon last week, and has since backed by further reports from &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/west-texas-measles-outbreak-children-treated-vitamin-a-medical-disinformation/"&gt;local media outlets&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, one of several counties in West Texas currently affected by measles, stated that it has treated fewer than 10 children with concurrent measles and vitamin A toxicity. Robert F. Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has touted vitamin A as a measles treatment, despite little rationale for its use in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several related outbreaks of measles ongoing in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/measles-kansas-multistate-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, now totaling over 500 reported cases since January (the actual toll is likely higher). These outbreaks have largely been concentrated among pockets of unvaccinated people, and vaccination remains the most effective measure to contain the spread of this highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr., a longtime and regularly debunked vaccine skeptic, has tepidly supported the use of vaccination during these outbreaks, but not without bringing up other worthless interventions. In early March, during a lengthy Fox News interview, Kennedy claimed that cod liver oil pills (rich in vitamin A), steroids, and antibiotics could be useful treatments for measles, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has shown that measles can be severe in children with vitamin A deficiency, and the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20recommends%20a%20daily%20oral%20dose%20of%20vitamin%20A%20for%20two%20days%20to%20children%20with%20measles%20living%20in%20areas%20where%20vitamin%20A%20deficiency%20may%20be%20present."&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children in regions where deficiency is common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But this deficiency is incredibly rare in the U.S. (perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20(US,and%20low%20absorption.%5B17%5D"&gt;around 0.3%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population), and there is no evidence that cod liver oil itself can be beneficial for measles. The high doses sometimes used to treat measles could also cause toxicity if given carelessly, which seems to be exactly what’s happening with these cases. Too much vitamin A can cause &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532916/#:~:text=Prolonged%20and%20excessive%20vitamin%20A%20intake%20can%20result%20in%20significant%20organ%20damage%2C%20including%20the%20liver%2C%20bones%2C%20central%20nervous%20system%2C%20and%20skin.%20Liver%C2%A0fibrosis%20or%20cirrhosis%20may%20be%20irreversible."&gt;significant, even irreversible&lt;/a&gt; organ damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;over 600 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. as of early April, including isolated, travel-related cases in 17 other states; 97% have involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. 74 people, mostly children, have been hospitalized. At least one person &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;has died&lt;/a&gt; as a result, while officials in New Mexico are investigating a &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188"&gt;second death&lt;/a&gt; that may have been connected to measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cases and deaths were entirely preventable, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-you-need-a-measles-booster-shot-the-answer-may-surprise-you-2000584301"&gt;highly effective and long-lasting vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. RFK’s support of vitamin A as a measles treatment is both wrongheaded and actively harming children with little choice in the matter. Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock has called for people to avoid excessive vitamin A use, given the potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

I discovered this when I looked through his social media posts online and saw some of the pics and messages he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not good enough. I said that I wanted all of the paraphernalia out of the house. Jason told me I didn’t get to dictate what he and his wife do in private. I told him we’ll see what the court has to say about this.&lt;/p&gt;

I realize that your ex’s proclivities may be shocking to you, but he and his wife aren’t doing anything wrong. They are two people in a committed relationship having an active sex life, much like other parents all over the world. The sex room and social media sharing may not be as common, but as long as they have committed to keeping their exploits away from their children, they aren’t violating any rules. There are many moms and dads who screw each other’s brains out on the family couch when the kids are away; these two have taken steps to create a child-free zone dedicated to lovemaking.&lt;br&gt;Please cease your attack on your ex’s way of life; he’s not putting his children in harm’s way. When your daughter comes back to you, talk to her about her time with her dad and his family; if anything ever seems amiss, then raise your concerns. But for now, you honestly shouldn’t have any. This couple’s sex life is none of your business so long as they keep it away from your child, and it sounds like they are. Please don’t bother some overworked CPS employee with something like this when there are children in actual danger that they need to worry about. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;—Jamilah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the infected person was not out in public during the infectious period, so there is no known public exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious disease and spreads through the air when a person coughs, sneezes or talks,” said director/health officer of Macomb County Health and Community Services Andrew Cox in a news release. “If you are not vaccinated for measles, get vaccinated as quickly as you can. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and loved ones from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macomb County Health Department also issued the following information on measles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Ninety percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected. Infected individuals can spread measles before noticing symptoms, including four days before the rash appears. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104˚F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If symptoms develop, call your doctor, urgent care, or hospital before seeking treatment so steps can be taken to prevent exposure to other individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cases are increasing across the U.S. and outbreaks are occurring nationally and globally. As of March 27, 2025, a total of 483 measles cases have been reported by 19 states (including Michigan).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection. A single dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97% effective. It is also effective if used within 72 hours of measles exposure to prevent illness. Anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccination is available from healthcare providers, pharmacies, and the Macomb County Health Department. Children eligible for the Vaccines for Children program may receive the vaccine from a provider enrolled in that program at no cost.

&lt;p&gt;Northwestern University engineers have developed a pacemaker so small that it can fit inside the tip of a syringe and be non-invasively injected into the body, according to a new study published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the pacemaker is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of newborn babies with congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pacemaker is an implantable device that helps maintain an even heart rate, either because the heart’s natural cardiac pacemaker provides an inadequate or irregular heartbeat, or because there is a block in the heart’s electrical conduction system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller than a single grain of rice, the pacemaker is paired with a small, soft, flexible, wireless, wearable device that mounts onto a patient’s chest to control pacing. When the wearable device detects an irregular heartbeat, it automatically shines a light to activate the pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These short light pulses, which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone, and muscles, control the pacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for patients who only need temporary pacing, the pacemaker simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed. All the pacemaker’s components are biocompatible, so they naturally dissolve into the body’s biofluids, bypassing the need for surgical extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the device’s efficacy across a series of large and small animal models as well as human hearts from deceased organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said John A. Rogers, PhD, professor of Neurological Surgery, Dermatology, and in the McCormick School of Engineering, who led the device development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body—the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/04/02/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Igor Efimov, PhD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiology and in the McCormick School of Engineering, who co-led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects, regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work builds on a previous collaboration between Rogers and Efimov, in which they developed the first dissolvable device for temporary pacing. Many patients require temporary pacemakers after heart surgery — either while waiting for a permanent pacemaker or to help restore a normal heart rate during recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the current standard of care, surgeons sew the electrodes onto the heart muscle during surgery. Wires from the electrodes exit the front of a patient’s chest, where they connect to an external pacing box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the temporary pacemaker is no longer needed, physicians remove the pacemaker electrodes. Potential complications include infection, dislodgement, torn or damaged tissues, bleeding, and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died,” Efimov said. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVANCES TO GET YOU EXCITED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Tiny Implantable Sensors Helped Broken Bones Heal in Weeks Rather Than Months" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/these-tiny-implantable-sensors-helped-broken-bones-heal-in-weeks-rather-than-months/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Tiny Implantable Sensors Helped Broken Bones Heal in Weeks Rather Than Months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this clinical need, Rogers, Efimov, and their teams developed their first dissolvable pacemaker, which was introduced in Nature Biotechnology in 2021. The thin, flexible, lightweight device eliminated the need for bulky batteries and rigid hardware, including wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help further reduce the device’s size, the researchers also reimagined its power source. Instead of using near-field communication to supply power, the new, tiny pacemaker operates through the action of a galvanic cell, a type of simple battery that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. Specifically, the pacemaker uses two different metals as electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to the heart. When in contact with surrounding biofluids, the electrodes form a battery. The resulting chemical reactions cause the electrical current to flow to stimulate the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said. “A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIODEGRADABLE IMPLANTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Dissolvable Implant Relieves Pain On Demand Without the Use of Drugs or Opioids" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/northwestern-u-dissolvable-implant-cuts-pain-without-drugs/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Dissolvable Implant Relieves Pain On Demand Without the Use of Drugs or Opioids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used an infrared wavelength of light that penetrates deeply and safely into the body. If the patient’s heart rate drops below a certain rate, the wearable device detects the event and automatically activates a light-emitting diode. The light then flashes on and off at a rate that corresponds to the normal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov said. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the pacemaker is so tiny—measuring just 1.8 millimeters in width, 3.5 millimeters in length and 1 millimeter in thickness—it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers said. “By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from The University of Manchester may reshape our understanding of what happens to the immune system when we fast. The study on mice shows that the brain's hypothalamus controls how the immune system adapts during fasting, through a handful of highly specialized neurons responsible for making animals hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adr3226" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; shows the brain's perception of hunger or fullness, rather than actual eating or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caloric+restriction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt;, is enough to drive changes in the body's immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings cast doubt on the current view that a lack of nutrients alone controls how the immune system responds to fasting, indicating the brain has a critical role, beyond the simple absence of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By artificially switching on specific brain neurons in mice—which typically signal low energy levels—scientists induced a synthetic sense of hunger. Remarkably, within hours, they saw a fast reorganization of immune cells in the blood, with a noticeable drop in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+monocytes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory monocytes&lt;/a&gt;. These artificially hungry mice looked, from an immune perspective, just like mice that had fasted for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery could have important implications for developing new therapies to treat a range of inflammatory diseases as well as for treating wasting syndromes seen in cancer, in which individuals lose weight despite eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also explain why obesity often accompanies inflammatory conditions and why malnourished individuals are more prone to infections and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The lead senior researcher, Dr. Giuseppe D'Agostino, who coordinated the study, said, "Our perceptions can shape our bodies in ways we don't always notice. It's easy to see how thoughts guide our actions, but this study reminds us that even our internal body adjustments that are not under conscious control respond to the brain's signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study underlines how important the brain is in regulating the immune system. But if internal or external factors alter the brain's perception, these processes can go awry, reminding us how deeply the mind and body are—and should remain—connected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborator and Manchester immunologist Professor Matt Hepworth added, "This work challenges the long-standing view that fasting's immunological impact is driven purely by nutrient levels. It highlights the nervous system's profound influence on how the immune system adapts during fasting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr. Cavalcanti de Albuquerque said, "By showing how the brain exerts top-down control over &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, we can further explore when and how fasting might deliver health benefits. It also opens up potential ways to treat infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychiatric conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

But actually finding pockets of time to sweat all throughout the week can be tricky, especially if you have a demanding day job and/or a hectic personal and family life. But, get this: Only exercising on the weekends or a couple of days a week may be as healthy as spreading physical activity out throughout the week, depending on your activity level, new research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was not perfect, it has raised plenty of questions about how much you really need to care about your exercise frequency and regularity. Here’s what researchers found—plus why doctors still recommend spreading out your workouts, if and when you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at the Orange Coast Medical Center. &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/bert-mandelbaum-819188.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bert Mandelbaum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bert Mandelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/jason-womack__;!!Ivohdkk!iMisgUKIoV09PW_VwMgQagrzAONwMouVZU3wC5WOGhcp4vB6LYLIi9bzTxBTeeXbClOvIZiJ1CV29Gp2BnPD7SRwy9McPQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason P.

The researchers organized participants into three groups based on their activity level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active weekend warriors: &lt;/strong&gt;People who get enough moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to meet health guidelines (150+ minutes per week), but at least 50 percent of their activity happens on just one or two days per week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: People who also hit the moderate-to-vigorous exercise criteria, but who spread it out more evenly across at least three days each week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactive&lt;/strong&gt;: People who didn’t meet the recommended 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that both the active regular and weekend warrior groups had a lower risk of death from all causes (up to 32 percent), as well as a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “Engaging in physical activity concentrated within one to two days was related with a similar reduction in mortality risk as more evenly spread activity,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, you shouldn’t sweat it if all you can manage is to crank out your workouts on weekends—it's still better for your health than being less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, if you're looking at people who are exercising at all, there is going to be some health benefit compared to people who are not working out as much," says Jason P. Womack, MD, chief of the Division of Sports Medicine and associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can weekend warriors earn the same health perks as more consistent exercisers, you ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the study results suggest that getting in the recommended weekly amount of exercise is beneficial for your health—especially when you’re looking at risk for conditions like heart disease and cancer risk, says Bert Mandelbaum, MD, sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [research] really shows that some exercise is good, more exercise is better, and most exercise is best,” he says. Being able to get your heart rate up for a certain period of time will always be helpful for your overall health, no matter when you can squeeze it in, Dr. Mandelbaum notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Berg, MD, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, agrees. “Exercise is medicine, and its impact on overall health—particularly heart health—cannot be overstated,” he says. That's true whether you spread it out or jam it in over a few days, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what should women take away from this finding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can only work out on the weekends, you can continue to do just that without stressing that you’re somehow screwing up your health. But the doctors we spoke with still aren’t convinced that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being a weekend warrior is the move if you do have the choice to spread out more exercise out during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this. One is that the researchers in this study only looked at seven days of physical activity data to determine what kind of exercise routine people had in place. So, someone who looked to be a so-called weekend warrior on that particular week may have actually been a more regular exerciser on other weeks—possibly skewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a strength program that fits into a busy schedule?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_weekend_warrior_study_a64388450" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive follow-along programs that work for every lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is that there are certain health metrics, such as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, that the study didn’t look at. (VO2 max measures how much oxygen you can use during intense exercise, and it’s considered a good indicator of fitness.) For example, “you can impact your VO2 max favorably by pushing workouts to the weekend, but you’ll have an even better VO2 max if you work out more consistently,” Dr. Mandelbaum explains. The study also didn't look at factors such as organ health or longevity, Dr. Mandelbaum points out—it only looked at mortality rates from specific causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to consider: Being a weekend warrior can also raise your risk of injury, especially if you’re starting from a lower level of fitness, Dr. Berg says. (If you only exercise once or twice a week, your body may not get accustomed to regular movement and muscle engagement, which can set you up for injury or not allow for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30626595/active-recovery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proper recovery;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;proper recovery&lt;/a&gt; between intense sessions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if working out on the weekends, or only a couple days in general during the week, is all you can manage, then great. But Dr. Mandelbaum recommends trying to do what you can to incorporate more pockets of movement into your schedule where you can. “Wake up a little earlier, and be more creative about when you can exercise,” he says. “The best bet for your health and fitness is to put exercise in some form into your day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 17:57:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1uUlVOcmZUTC1SSm4xU0hORkZLT3BybmRBeE1WQlBDUUtsWG9LOG1TTHZSOWd2MmxDd0R1SWJaYWtGMUN2RVc2VG9KV1JQV2w1NnEzbDJNdVBXVkh5UmpBZ1hFc0l3azFGZnBObHg3SDVLOGVFN2E0a2x3</guid></item><item><title>Dementia: Shingles vaccine lowers risk by 20%, large dataset suggests - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOcmhtYWNfY0M0UEsydnY4QWF3OFVBSVQ4MTh4U2M1a1dmWk5pUEdpM1ZYNXNFeGc2WUk3U2lBZHprRmJKRmhueTFyTVQwcXd6MUV4VS1sTkw1ODRRY3dfTlptOVJ4QkpDaXJxMG8tU004b1RESFhyaXhmUnl5S3N2cnpJSW41b0loQmF0emRxSU5RQVNlcHBkeUtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="several syringes" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-anm8j2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fshingles-vaccine-could-prevent-1-in-5-dementia-cases&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F04%2Fdementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Dementia%3A%20Shingles%20vaccine%20lowers%20risk%20by%2020%25%2C%20large%20dataset%20suggests" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1pu01zb"&gt;Getting vaccinated against shingles could help keep dementia at bay.

About half of those eligible for the vaccine received it, compared with almost none of those not eligible. In their analysis, they allowed for the fact that not everyone who was eligible for the vaccine received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 7 year follow up, of the 296,324 people in the sample, 14,465 had at least one diagnosis of shingles.

Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, urged some caution about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler asked: “If the effect on dementia was real, was it due to the vaccine or was it due to the lower incidence of shingles in the study population?“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly the Zostavax vaccine was effective at preventing shingles. However,“ he cautioned, “that vaccine is no longer available in the United States. Instead, we have the much more effective Shingrix vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until a study is done comparing the Zostavax and Shingrix vaccines, involving thousands of people over many years (very costly, and unlikely to occur) it won’t be known if the Shingrix vaccine will yield comparable effects,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study provides strong evidence of a link between shingles vaccination and lower dementia risk, a randomized controlled trial would be needed to establish a definitive causal relationship. If confirmed, this could shift public health priorities and encourage further research into how vaccines might play a role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler agreed. “For now, a good take home point is that shingles vaccines are effective for preventing shingles, which is adequate reason for getting this vaccine if you are eligible. An additional, benefit might be protection against dementia,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added that: “This protection is far from assured. So […] the other known means of preventing cognitive decline as we age should still be pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 16:48:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOcmhtYWNfY0M0UEsydnY4QWF3OFVBSVQ4MTh4U2M1a1dmWk5pUEdpM1ZYNXNFeGc2WUk3U2lBZHprRmJKRmhueTFyTVQwcXd6MUV4VS1sTkw1ODRRY3dfTlptOVJ4QkpDaXJxMG8tU004b1RESFhyaXhmUnl5S3N2cnpJSW41b0loQmF0emRxSU5RQVNlcHBkeUtn</guid></item><item><title>This Common Vaccine Could Lower Your Dementia Risk - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1yV01uQXFCZndKZE81Y3NRbGJJb3dvX3l0UjhBRDQ0WnduRk9HbUhVRUV2QXFNclluMkJHU3RrajNjWFNacWNoOGFlckJ2UWFiRkNYakpDVUtBNU9JX1FxV20zUTNweVA5aF84ZDdvcEZBblREN2J2aHln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Common Vaccine Could Lower Your Dementia Risk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;retales botijero - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're over 50, chances are your doctor has talked to you about getting the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61740092/shingles-vaccine-dementia-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shingles vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;shingles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.

Thankfully, a vaccine can prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And scientists have recently realized that this vax could have an added perk beyond protecting you from this pesky infection: It may actually lower your risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the major takeaway from new research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08800-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64379567%2Fshingles-vaccine-dementia-risk-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But while some lifestyle tweaks have been shown to reduce your risk of dementia by a little bit, these findings suggest the shingles vaccine could have a pretty major impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the connection may seem random, infectious disease doctors say it actually makes sense.

(This ruling was due to limited supply and because scientists didn’t think the vaccine was as effective in people over the age of 80.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of seven years, about half of the people who could receive the vaccine actually got it. Some of the people who were considered ineligible also received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered that people who got the shingles vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over seven years than those who didn’t get the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are dementia and shingles linked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chicken pox, explains &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Russo,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; MD, professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. After people get the chicken pox, the virus remains in their nerve cells for life. When people get older or have weakened immune systems, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles, per Dr. Russo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The varicella-zoster virus can affect the blood vessels and the central nervous system, which includes the brain,” Dr. Russo says. “When you get reactivation of this virus, it could damage your central nervous system, including your brain, through inflammation.” There’s a chance that inflammation may raise the risk of dementia as a result, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also some lab &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754275/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:evidence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that shingles can lead to the formation of beta-amyloid, which are a factor in Alzheimer’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amesh A.

But actually finding pockets of time to sweat all throughout the week can be tricky, especially if you have a demanding day job and/or a hectic personal and family life. But, get this: Only exercising on the weekends or a couple of days a week may be as healthy as spreading physical activity out throughout the week, depending on your activity level, new research found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the study was not perfect, it has raised plenty of questions about how much you really need to care about your exercise frequency and regularity.

The researchers organized participants into three groups based on their activity level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="6" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="6.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0.0"&gt;Active weekend warriors: &lt;/strong&gt;People who get enough moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to meet health guidelines (150+ minutes per week), but at least 50 percent of their activity happens on just one or two days per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="6.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.1.0"&gt;Active regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: People who also hit the moderate-to-vigorous exercise criteria, but who spread it out more evenly across at least three days each week &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="6.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.2.0"&gt;Inactive&lt;/strong&gt;: People who didn’t meet the recommended 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that both the active regular and weekend warrior groups had a lower risk of death from all causes (up to 32 percent), as well as a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “Engaging in physical activity concentrated within one to two days was related with a similar reduction in mortality risk as more evenly spread activity,” the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Basically, you shouldn’t sweat it if all you can manage is to crank out your workouts on weekends—it's still better for your health than being less active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"Generally, if you're looking at people who are exercising at all, there is going to be some health benefit compared to people who are not working out as much," says Jason P. Womack, MD, chief of the Division of Sports Medicine and associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-weekend-warriors-earn-the-same-health-perks-as-more-consistent-exercisers-you-ask" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;How can weekend warriors earn the same health perks as more consistent exercisers, you ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;At baseline, the study results suggest that getting in the recommended weekly amount of exercise is beneficial for your health—especially when you’re looking at risk for conditions like heart disease and cancer risk, says Bert Mandelbaum, MD, sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“This [research] really shows that some exercise is good, more exercise is better, and most exercise is best,” he says. Being able to get your heart rate up for a certain period of time will always be helpful for your overall health, no matter when you can squeeze it in, Dr. Mandelbaum notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Christopher Berg, MD, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, agrees. “Exercise is medicine, and its impact on overall health—particularly heart health—cannot be overstated,” he says. That's true whether you spread it out or jam it in over a few days, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-should-women-take-away-from-this-finding" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;So, what should women take away from this finding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you can only work out on the weekends, you can continue to do just that without stressing that you’re somehow screwing up your health. But the doctors we spoke with still aren’t convinced that &lt;em data-node-id="16.1"&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being a weekend warrior is the move if you do have the choice to spread out more exercise out during the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few reasons for this. One is that the researchers in this study only looked at seven days of physical activity data to determine what kind of exercise routine people had in place. So, someone who looked to be a so-called weekend warrior on that particular week may have actually been a more regular exerciser on other weeks—possibly skewing the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Need a strength program that fits into a busy schedule?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_weekend_warrior_study_a64388450" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_weekend_warrior_study_a64388450" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up for WH+" data-node-id="18.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive follow-along programs that work for every lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another is that there are certain health metrics, such as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="VO2 max" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, that the study didn’t look at. (VO2 max measures how much oxygen you can use during intense exercise, and it’s considered a good indicator of fitness.) For example, “you can impact your VO2 max favorably by pushing workouts to the weekend, but you’ll have an even better VO2 max if you work out more consistently,” Dr. Mandelbaum explains. The study also didn't look at factors such as organ health or longevity, Dr. Mandelbaum points out—it only looked at mortality rates from specific causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;One more thing to consider: Being a weekend warrior can also raise your risk of injury, especially if you’re starting from a lower level of fitness, Dr. Berg says. (If you only exercise once or twice a week, your body may not get accustomed to regular movement and muscle engagement, which can set you up for injury or not allow for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30626595/active-recovery/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30626595/active-recovery/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="proper recovery" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;proper recovery&lt;/a&gt; between intense sessions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But ultimately, if working out on the weekends, or only a couple days in general during the week, is all you can manage, then great. But Dr. Mandelbaum recommends trying to do what you can to incorporate more pockets of movement into your schedule where you can. “Wake up a little earlier, and be more creative about when you can exercise,” he says. “The best bet for your health and fitness is to put exercise in some form into your day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

            More than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/health/anxiety-increases-dementia-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;55 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide have dementia, a number expected to nearly triple by 2050. Deaths from strokes &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(23)00277-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;may double by&lt;/a&gt; the same year, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3830423/" target="_blank"&gt;10% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; of adults experience depression later in life.

            While the numbers are striking, there’s a growing body of evidence showing that many of these cases may not be genetically fated, but rather could be delayed or prevented altogether by addressing health factors generally within our control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            At least 17 factors contribute to dementia, stroke and late-life depression, according to an extensive &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925" target="_blank"&gt;review published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry.

            Addressing the 17 factors can reduce people’s risk for all three conditions. Those factors are, in no order of importance:

            “This study just really shows how powerful lifestyle and behavioral changes are for age-related brain diseases,” said senior study author Dr. Sanjula Singh, an instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator at the Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000o3b6mz914dqbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Ultimately, we hope that people feel like there’s a hopeful message in here — that there are actually so many things that you can work on, and then not only your risk of stroke is lower, but also of dementia and/or of late-life depression,” Singh noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000p3b6m4xhdoult@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, studies, tools or risk-prediction models have usually focused on these conditions individually. “From a human perspective, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Singh said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000q3b6met2l2woe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, people wouldn’t want to develop any of these conditions, she added, so the research team wanted to find shared risk factors so people can essentially achieve multiple goals using the same tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000r3b6mou2ct88l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors reviewed 59 meta-analyses — syntheses of data from multiple similar studies — that were published between 2000 and 2023 and had investigated the effects of modifiable risk factors on stroke, dementia and/or late-life depression among adults who weren’t previously diagnosed with these conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000s3b6mnlhmz6on@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All 17 factors were shared by at least two of the conditions, but there were no meta-analyses on relationships between late-life depression and 11 of the health measures: alcohol intake, BMI, blood sugar, cognitive activity, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, social engagement and stress, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000t3b6mi28sls8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of all the measures, blood pressure had the biggest impact. A &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20050982" target="_blank"&gt;normal blood pressure level&lt;/a&gt; is below 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg. People with a level of 140/90 mm Hg or greater were more than twice as likely to have a stroke, 20% more likely to develop dementia and 16% more likely to experience depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000u3b6m3lymuctc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other top influential factors were smoking, sleep, physical activity and blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000v3b6mc1o4xqeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Grouping these all together is important, because I think different people derive different levels of motivation to make a behavior change” based on their personal concerns, such as a family history of dementia, stroke or depression, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000w3b6mlsil6ix5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Data studies like this can help empower people to make meaningful changes in their day-to-day lives,” Isaacson added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If 17 items seem overwhelming, look at it as a menu from which you can choose a few items — and work your way through the list over time, Singh said. But also know these factors overlap, she said — if you’re improving your diet and exercise, for example, you’re probably improving several things on that list, including blood pressure, blood sugar, sleep and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Not sure what to choose? Here’s how you can address what experts said are some of the most important determinants of dementia, stroke and depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000z3b6mfxwjw1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Lowering high blood pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure means less blood flow to the brain, which has a direct relationship with stroke and dementia, but is also associated with depression by way of reducing neurotransmitters in the brain, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs00103b6my2iadupm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To address high blood pressure, you can have your level checked by a machine at a drugstore, a doctor or a home device, experts said. &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;Lowering salt intake&lt;/a&gt; and getting &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20benefits%20of%20potassium,Certain%20medications" target="_blank"&gt;enough potassium&lt;/a&gt; are important for reducing blood pressure, as well as exercising, losing excess weight, managing stress and seeing a sleep specialist if you &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/health/biden-sleep-apnea-cpap-machine-wellness/index.html"&gt;have sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;. A doctor can determine whether you also need medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Older adults need &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898" target="_blank"&gt;at least seven hours&lt;/a&gt; of sleep nightly. You can help ensure a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness/index.html"&gt;good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt; by keeping your room cool, quiet and dark; not drinking alcohol or caffeine in the several hours before bed; limiting screen time at night; and having a bedtime routine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Regulate your blood sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise, weight management and a healthy diet that limits refined carbohydrates and added sugars can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/health/diabetes-prevention-wellness/index.html"&gt;maintain healthy blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels.

            The findings from the latest study inform the existing Brain Care Score, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/health/brain-care-score-dementia-stroke-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;developed in 2023&lt;/a&gt; at the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital to help people gauge and manage their risk for dementia or stroke without medical procedures.

            The 21-point score refers to how a person fares on 12 health-related factors concerning physical, lifestyle and social-emotional components of health. To this list, the new study adds pain, depressive symptoms, hearing loss, cognitive activity and kidney disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers behind the score anticipate an updated version will be published later this year. For now, you can take the &lt;a href="https://redcap.partners.org/redcap/surveys/?s=JN7CJ4LKW8LEADWR" target="_blank"&gt;current edition here&lt;/a&gt;.

Now, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine believe it could help cancer cells grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, researchers deliberately gave mice breast cancer cells and fed one group of them safflower oil, which is high in linoleic acid. The mice fed the oil had faster-growing tumors than the placebo group that did not consume linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research revealed linoleic acid can activate mTORC1 — the 'control center' in cells that decides whether they grow, divide or make proteins. In aggressive breast cancer, excess linoleic acid overstimulates mTORC1, fueling tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine, said: ‘We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors recommend taking in more omega-3s in the form of salmon and other oily fish and nuts. Omega-6s, though, generally come in the form of vegetable oils used in cooking, processed foods, and fast food&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess linoleic acid is delivered throughout the body by a protein called FABP5, which overstimulates the mTORC1 in cells, promoting tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers measured levels of FABP5 across various kinds of cancer before deciding to test the acid’s impact on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which produce much higher levels of FABP5 than other types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before inserting the cancer cells into the mice, researchers conducted experiments in lab petri dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They grew human breast cancer cells, both TNBC and hormone-positive, and added pure linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the acid was introduced, the mTORC1 'control center' was activated only in the triple-negative breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further experiments showed linoleic acid only overactivated mTORC1 when FABP5 was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then for the mice experiment, one group was fed a high-linoleic acid diet, while the other group ate their normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group had triple-negative breast cancer cells that naturally produced too much FABP5, while the other group had non-TNBC tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that linoleic acid fueled the growth of tumors only in mice with cancers that had higher levels of FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The research team tested their findings in mice with triple-negative breast cancer.

Now, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine believe it could help cancer cells grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, researchers deliberately gave mice breast cancer cells and fed one group of them safflower oil, which is high in linoleic acid.

In aggressive breast cancer, excess linoleic acid overstimulates mTORC1, fueling tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine, said: ‘We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors recommend taking in more omega-3s in the form of salmon and other oily fish and nuts.

On Monday, the Trump Administration directed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of $11.4 billion in loans and grants, according to &lt;i&gt;The Hill&lt;/i&gt;. In Texas, where the recent outbreak has hit hardest, 50 vaccination clinics have been closed as a result, and more than 20 public health workers have been laid off. The Texas Department of State Health Services has identified 422 cases since late January; 42 patients have been hospitalized and one school-aged child has died. Nationally, three separate outbreaks have affected 483 people in 2025. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), run by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., oversees health initiatives. He suggested Thursday that some of the agency’s fired employees would be asked to return. “Some programs that were cut, they’re being reinstated,” Kennedy told reporters. “Personnel that should not have been cut were cut. We’re reinstating them.” It comes after he announced plans last month to slash up to 10,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="read-it-at-btn" href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5230563-texas-measles-vaccine-clinics-trump-funding-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Read it at &lt;span&gt;The Hill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQZXNCbmh5N1VBVk03WUVHUV9heV9HMmFOc3Rkbjd4RFNsSzFmUGZaRWY2LWlRTFNKSWFreHBQbnlCd21QcEo5dDdTM1pFSUdsdkNuQnh3U3gxc1pJUFdqTUx3MENubjd1cTRlU3lNZTNHTFJ3Z21rMzJyTzNtZHVwTi1MNW1fUkVsN19rc0FuX3A</guid></item><item><title>The Secret to Longevity: Keep Moving - Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta - Podcast on CNN Audio - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNY0FPeVVDMDQ1WmxQbGg5Nl9lWEpMQmZhc0I3blFUWXUxSE41SkFFc0JjdnBCS2FHVThqLTItemN6V09fcUdsWE5VUGxfbzd6VThweWZzdjMxb0dfZV9haXdSZDIwNmM1dTRhQ0UtN3U4TmY0NlFSV0lVU01fZFJMbHJRTE9xeFpmanZNMjgxcFdUeDVhR2kyZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

It's got to be as important to you as the most important habits in your life. You've got to make exercise and movement one of those priorities. And that is why I am recording this podcast right now from the ground. Okay, I'm going to explain. I know you can't see me, so you're going to have to take my word for it, and my wife, who is actually helping me right now, I'm sitting down on the ground, crisscross applesauce, a man in his mid-fifties, why? Because it turns out that doing this every day, just sitting on the ground is really good for my body, it's really good for my joints, and good for muscles, but also importantly, my ability or inability to get up from this position without really using my hands or any help from Rebecca. That is a real test of my overall health and fitness.

              'So I wanted to have Kelly on the podcast today to talk about this idea of mobility. What exactly is it? Why is it so important as we age? What are some potential red flags? And to give all of us busy people some of the simple tools to improve our range of motion, our posture, decrease our pain, and yes, become more mobile. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. Criss-cross applesauce to standing up. I'm not gonna lie, I did use for a split second my left palm to sort of just boost me up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I think when I was reading about you, one of the things that sort of struck me was this idea of just fitness and how people define it. Like I think of myself as a fit person, but to be honest, after again, reading some of your work, I started to wonder about that a little bit because I focus a lot on strength, I focus on cardio. But one of things that you talk a lot about though is mobility. And it almost seemed like a third pillar. So cardio, strength, mobility, and it made total sense as I was, you know, again, reading your work. So I wonder maybe if we could start with some basic definitions. What is mobility? What does that mean?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'We, when we started to think critically about how teaching this and the language around it, what we had was non-specific words like stretching and flexibility.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right and what you'd say to someone is do you stretch and like your coaches were like, did you stretch? Oh, yeah. Yeah sure coach I stretched and like

              You talked to my coach apparently. Yeah, yeah, sure.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah, yeah, sure. So what we found was we didn't have clear definitions of what those things meant. So we tried to use this word mobility and what we intended were, and I would say, I'll give you two definitions. One is that every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agrees about what the body should be able to do. We've said, here's what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that, and here's what temperature is and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion. So what ended up happening is we create this definition of do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve? Now let me give you the definition that I have in my 50s, right? This is a little bit different now. Number one, are you pain-free? And I think this is really important because I think the problem is that it's very normal for human beings to experience pain and discomfort. That is, I mean, talk to your children, everyone like knee hurts, back hurts, right? This is a feature and what we're trying to do is help people reimagine what does pain mean by starting by saying pain is a request for change. And number two, I want you to be able to do with your body what you want as it relates to your job, as it related to your recreation, as it relate to being a family member. And that's a much better definition of mobility.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So just a couple of quick questions about that. The normative range of motion. So again, I think cardio and strength and I can measure how fast I'm running. I can see how much weight I lift. But when it comes to mobility, I'm in my 50s as well. So would your normative range of motion and mine be the same? Is it changed throughout our lives? Different from men and women?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Kelly Starrett
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Great question. So no, the one thing that doesn't have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion. We absolutely are likely to see if you know, nobody ever said, hey, you should put your arms over your head or be able to take a big breath, you might get stiff in your shoulders and upper back. What we don't have change is our access to our range of emotion. So for example, one of the ways that one of ways we want to think about this is I have a finite amount of time to work on my body. It would be great if I could go to a fantasy health ranch and I could have someone massage me every day and someone makes my meals and someone does a perfect program. But let me introduce you to having teenagers and working a crazy job. And like this is all of us. And so one of the things we really try to spend a lot of time is saying, how do we simplify the process so it doesn't feel so overwhelming? I'm not giving a busy working mother another listicle. Here's how you're gonna optimize your morning routine. She's just stoked to have a coffee and get her kids out the door with lunch, right? So what we wanna be thinking about is where are the places in my day-to-day life where I have some agency and some control? And one of the things I'd like everyone to leave here with is if you begin to sit on the floor in the evening for 20 or 30 minutes. We know you're watching TV, the research bears that out. So all I want you to do is... get off your couch and sit on the floor. And you can sit cross-legged, you can be 90-90, you can side-saddle, you put your legs out in front of you, you can kneel, I don't, it doesn't matter. In fact, when you need to fidget, go fidget change your positions. But what we found is that if we can spend 20 or 30 minutes in the evening, touching some of these novel shapes of the tissues. You know, we're in, if we took a step back and I said, okay, I'm gonna look at all of your movements during the day. What are all the things that Sanjay does during the day? I could create almost like a library of words, of vocabulary words. I can see the shapes you are in. Most of us occupy just a few shapes. We just use a few words. We get up out of the bed, we stand up, we walk around, we sit back at the desk. Maybe I do a little peloton, which again is more sitting and it just, you know, more aggressive sitting. And all of a sudden what we see is we didn't really take our bodies into the shapes and positions that we're capable of. And one of the ways that we can begin to shift and expand your movement language is to just start to have some exposure to some of these shapes where having the body engage in body-like things. And I think that's how we can began to say, how do we simplify this seemingly complexity in that world? Well, let's begin by sitting on the ground.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:34
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love that. I mean, it's simple, obviously, but and I think I understand what you're saying. You're utilizing different you say language, but using different muscles different Joints and things like that to sit on the ground and then you have to get up and that's by the way a quick side story. Jimmy Carter, I interviewed him several years ago as 2015 I think yeah, what a guy And I'll never forget at the end of the interview he was sitting in a nice chair and at the end of the interview, he got up out of that chair without putting his hands on the side rests. And I was just kind of blown away by that. Of course, you know, a lot of people when they get up out of a chair like I am right now, they're kind of giving themselves a little boost with their arms. He didn't do that. And I remember thinking, I hope I'm like that when I'm in my 80s. But you've brought up this notion a couple of times now, Kelly, this correlation between mobility and longevity. Yeah. Well, my guess is, you can correct me if I'm wrong, is that as a society, especially in the developed world, we've probably become less mobile because we're addicted to these devices, we're sitting in these chairs, on computers. So it's gotten worse, not better, and yet at the same time, we know that mobility is associated with longevity.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We can absolutely just start there is that we can say, well, what's the number one reason people end up in the ER? Turns out it's falls. What's the Number one predictor of death above people at 65? A fall. And one of the reasons we're seeing is if I don't have access to balance or range of motion, I can't solve as many movement problems and losing your balance is a movement problem. Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you're holding your baby or your cat or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problems. So how can we keep as many movement solutions available to the brain as we can and the stiffer we become, the less access easily that we have of our joints, but getting up and off the ground, not only Does it help me create and maintain my movement solutions. It correlates really well with living well because of all the ancillary benefits that come with it. I'm more likely to garden and be outside and be able to stay connected to my community. I'm likely to want to be in an exercise class. I'm more likely to be less timorous about riding my bike around Central Park. And the real question is, who and where are we thinking about this? And the answer is, we're not. We like the word. We think longevity is definitely a buzzword right now. We all want to be, we're obsessed with being old. But ultimately, Julia and I feel like, my wife, and who's my business partner, we feel like durability is the best word. And the reason is, we think the hits are going to come. If you're over 50, you're going to, something bad, Your body's going to throw an error. You're likely to have something bad happen to you. You are not as robust. So, what we're really saying is If I wanna have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendions my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons. Otherwise, they're not gonna be available to me as readily. And the good news everyone, muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs. They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no wage do you lose the ability to reclaim range of emotions. It's gonna be a little slower than when you were 15. That's true. but the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt. So let's begin with something really simple.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Look, I think as much as we talk about fitness on this podcast, I don't think we've talked about this topic enough, and I think Kelly is really spot on here. The human body has this remarkable ability to adapt and grow and heal, in both directions, by the way. It can get bad really fast, and it can improve really fast. So it's never too late to reclaim our ability to move pain-free and to live well. So when we come back, Kelly's going to give us some pretty simple tools to help us get started.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              You and your wife, as you mentioned, Juliette, by the way, that's fantastic, that your wife is your business partner and you guys have the same interests and you wrote a book together. And one of the things that you talked about in the book was this concept of mobility vital signs. Yeah. And you're likening this to, you're measuring your blood pressure, your respiratory rate, actual vital signs, how did that come about? How did you start to think about this in terms of vital signs?
            &lt;/p&gt;

              We do and and that exists though to be clear like if I  if I came to see you Kelly, The idea that you could objectively tell me what my what my What these measures should be for my mobility that exists that exists

              'Absolutely. And you don't need a professional person to help you understand how your body moves. So for example, everyone can understand that 120 over 80 is not heroic blood pressure. It's a sign where we start to say, hey, maybe we need to make a little small change in our environments, our behaviors. And what we found was that we hadn't done that for how the body moves in space. And we certainly hadn't in the language of mere mortals. So how can I understand my range of motion. How can my children begin to understand their minimum range of motion? And then what are the simple tools to help me just keep an eye on it? We were democratizing self-care. The same way we all think we all should probably eat fruits and vegetables and some quality protein, we should get some sunshine and we should play. We just wanna objectively measure those things a little bit so that we can begin to say, oh, wow, I haven't done this for a while. Or, hey, my knee hurts. I look at how stiff my quads are and it turns out I found a problem and that's something I can change.

But you mentioned the first vital sign, which is being able to get up and down from the ground, which I think is great. Second one, I'll just mention a few of these. Maybe we can talk about a couple of them. Breathing, just how long can you hold your breath? Um, which again, there's objective measures of this. You can count how long you can hold your breath, but there's normative standards as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'The first movement of the spine is the breath. That's the first thing that the body does is it takes this breath. Rib cage needs to expand, the belly distends, right? And what we see oftentimes is we fail to appreciate how the environment is impacting my ability to ventilate effortlessly. So probably people have heard that when you're not working really hard, you should probably be able to breathe through your nose most of the time. And one of the reasons we do that is that we get better function. Suddenly if I take a nose breath, my diaphragm is recruited. If I breathe through my mouth, I don't really use my diaphragms. I end up using my neck musculature. But if I'm using my knack all the time to ventilate because I can't access my diaphragm or I'm sitting in a chair, well suddenly you have really ineffective breathing So you're going to walk up those stairs and feel out of breath, even though You're not. And then the impacts it potentially has on our anxiety, our abilities to regulate, is really profound. And what's cool is that I'm pretty sure modern people are not the first people to ever think about breathing. I'm sure it's a cornerstone of the yoga traditions. People have been doing this for a long time, but by tapping into the objective work of our brothers and sisters out there, we were realizing that, hey, we should probably put this as a vital sign because it has so many possibilities to up-regulate function. Right, right. No.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              There's 10 of these vital signs, and I'm just gonna tick through a few of them. The next one is one that I gotta tell you, Kelly, I have trouble with hip mobilization. And it's interesting, I remember, I like to do triathlons, and I remember getting done with a triathlon and just being kind of pretty racked at the end of this thing. Way more racked than I should have been. I was just like, God, I mean, this is not fun, and I feel. And I went to go see a physical therapist who was near the finish line, and right away it was all about my hips and the hip mobilization. So you've listed that sort of as a third vital sign. Why is it so important and what could someone like me do about it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, you know, we fortunately have already talked a little bit about one of my favorite interventions which is sitting on the ground. Which is your first vital sign as well, right? So these are, these, they're related. Yeah, absolutely. So looking at how your knee comes to your chest is one of those key pieces. And one of the reasons we started with the sit and rise test is that in order to stand up from a seated position, cross leg position, you have to lean forward to shift your center of mass over your feet. So you're sitting cross legged, but if your hips are stiff and you can't bring your knee to your chest or your chest to your knee, that becomes impossible. It becomes an impossible test. So all we're doing is putting the body into position that requires more normative, not even full range, just some baseline range of motion to express that hip range of motion. And the reason we love that test is that it's one of the first times where people confront the fact that their hips are stiff, because you were able to do a triathlon and still kick butt, but you didn't even need to have full range of motion. But what you experienced is that you paid a very high session cost. You had to pay a price for this inefficiency. So imagine you're driving your car with your handbrake on. Look, cars, human beings aren't cars, I get it. But if I just click that handbrake on one notch, there's sort of a drag on the system. You're not gonna get good fuel economy, your brakes get a little hot sometimes. It's not a high performance machine. So all we're trying to do is say, let's take the brakes off by restoring. And this knee to chest is a really simple way to do that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I'm going to do it right after this podcast. I'm going to self-assess, Kelly, and I'll call you and let you know how it goes. Another chapter in the book is called Future Proof Your Neck and Your Shoulders. And again, we talked about the fact that so many of us are on devices and staring at computer screens way too much. What's an easy way for listeners to sort of assess if they're starting to get into the danger zone with regard to that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, let's start by saying not necessarily a danger zone. You could have terrible shoulder range of motion, not be able to take a full breath, and you may never have neck pain. But likely is your tolerances for silliness start to go a little bit down, right? And then you've been in front of your computer all day long, and all of a sudden you're like, hey, your neck is a little but sore. And again, I think most of us are like, my neck's a little sore, let me reach for that glass of wine or ibuprofen because I don't have time for that right now. So what we can do instead is start to say, hey, what is it I'm supposed to do? And notice that we already talked about one of the most important interventions for neck pain, which is breathing. So if we restore your ability to ventilate, to take a massive breath, what you're gonna see is that your rib cage, your thoracic spine, ends up being a really important chassis off of which your neck and head function. So we start to see the neck, the shoulder, and the upper back as a really simple system. And if we want to improve one aspect of the system, we look at other aspects of that system. So for example, if you're sitting here with me and you're listening to this and I'm slouching, if I turn my head to the right, I may not be able to rotate as far. Now watch this. Get into a position where you can take a big breath. So you and I are both going to adopt slightly dwarf organizations. I didn't tell you what to do with your head or your shoulders. As I said, get into a positioning and take a bigger breath. And if you rotate now from that position, you'll see that you can rotate a lot further. And that hints at the fact that when we're in better sort of organized sort of geometries, better structures, that hint at more function, we get more function back. And when we restore people's function, we oftentimes knock paint out because we're not overusing tissues, we're misusing tissues.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And I don't mean to oversimplify, but just posture, just your overall posture, when you're sitting, when you are standing. I slouch, time to time, my mom.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So say we all, how big a deal is that? How much do you think about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think we should, if I took a picture of you, just not aware, would you like what you saw, right? In terms of how you're organized. And what I'll tell you is that there are a lot of hints out there about what good organization looks like. Look at the Vitruvian man, right, shoulders, I mean, that's Shavasana, right. So it's almost like our, you know, our genius was like, hmm, these yogis know something about Shavasna. That's the same organizations as the Vitruvian man. So, really... posture is the Latin derivative is just position. So what you're saying is, I have good position or a bad position. And what we wanna be clear is that there are postures, there are positions and shapes that are more highly correlated with dysfunction. So forward head on neck, rounded shoulders, those positions may or may not ever cause pain, but they're certainly really bad positions to swim in. And more importantly, they are well correlated with disease with dysfunction. But what we don't wanna say is, I have pain because of my posture. What we say is hey, the reason we choose this organization of the body is that it maintains more lights on in the room.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I mean, have you ever wondered why, if we have this sort of native way that we should carry ourselves, this native way, that we should be mobile, that we should sit, if we are sitting or standing, why do we lapse into these sort of bad habits, would you say? What, why does, I mean, because it is quite normal to, if I look around the office, to see a lot of people slouching, or even if they're walking and standing, they're sort of head forward, You know, is it just because of the technologies that? Is that what's doing it to us? Why do we evolve this way?
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I tell you what, we, uh, we wrote another book called ready to run. Ready to run, play off on our friend, Chris McDougall's book. And one of the things that we wanted to say is like running is a natural normative skill. But what we noticed with our kids was that we had all these beautiful runners, everyone runs the same in kindergarten. They all like they're little Usain bolts. They run on their foot, they lean forward. They have powerful hip extension. and they land on the ball of the foot, and then halfway through the first grade, some of those kids start to do heel striking. They fundamentally alter their primary locomotive pattern. So instead of sprinting now they're putting their foot out in front of them and heel striking, and they're in these crazy shoes. And it's crazy. That's like halfway through the first great we switched from riding right-handed to left-handed. That's what the equivalent is. Like, hey, we have this skill we've been developing for six years, and now let's throw that skill away and change it. We have to ask, what has changed for this child? And the only answer is they're now engaged in more chronic sitting at desk behaviors. So their bodies have started to adapt. So when we see people our age, the peak of their powers and they're working hard, what we see is their body tells a story of their movement history, of their environments. And there's a reason that when you run into a gymnast, you're like, oh yeah, you are a gymnasts, I can tell, right? You were a dancer. What is it about that? Well, part of that experience of being able to do those things is that we had to practice a certain carriage and organization that turns out to transfer really well to these pieces. And so what we need to do as modern humans now is say, hey, maybe I have to think differently a little bit, or I have sort of manage this adaptation response to the environment. And that might just be by sitting on the ground or. hanging from a pull-up bar, which is one of my absolute favorite interventions. You wanna change your posture, start to put a pull up bar on your house, start to hang on something, go to the park, spend three minutes hanging, you can have your feet on the ground and you will be a different human being into you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Even with your feet on the ground, just hanging from the... What is it? Just, it's, I guess, addressing many of the things that you're talking about with these vital signs. Yes, yes.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              and doing so in a play, movement position. Right, you can do downward dog too. Three minutes of downward dog a day will get you. But what you'll see is that I don't even have to be skilled. I can just put my arms up and just let gravity take over and you'll start to see changes in your shoulder, changes in you upper back, your ability to rotate, your ability take a big breath. All of those things will change. And maybe some of you need four minutes a day and some of only need one minute a day. This is, this is,

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This far more fascinating than I even expected it to be. And I expected it be fascinating. I love this. Will you come back, because what I'm going to do is I'm gonna spend some real time putting into practice some of the things that you've talked about today. And I'd love to give you a report and just get some feedback.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              I love it. And I, again, I want to get beyond pain, no pain. I want to be, I wanna know how you swam faster, how you dusted that kid, that young 17 year old kid at the gym, I wanted to know how you crushed him. And ultimately, you know, we feel like if we can improve the health of the household, we don't need to worry necessarily about some of the things that the universe is telling us to worry about. We are robust, incredible humans and the magic is being able to spend time with our friends and family, with our neighbors, and walking, playing, these are the ways of how we transform our communities and society.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, that's the ultimate measure, I think, like you said, but the human body is so remarkable. And I sometimes think, you know, people buy these really fancy SUVs that are all tricked out and all they do is drive their kids to school a couple miles and back. They never really put it to the test. And some of the things that you're talking about allows our human bodies to be put to the test and to show off a little bit in terms of what we can do, which is fantastic.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Yeah, you know, I'll just leave everyone with an anecdotal story. We started walking school bus for our to bring our kids to elementary school. Not everyone felt like they could walk their kids were like, we'll be here. It takes about 25 minutes, we will be here every morning. We have a little more flexibility in our schedule. But drop your kids off. And so we started dropping, we started walking our kids and we got out of the drop off lane, which was toxic and chaos. And we'd walk this mile and a quarter to school, interact rain or shine. And then parents were kind of started jumping in with us. And We had a couple parents who lost 30 pounds. Wow. Walking their kid to school. And they were like, this has changed my life. I'm like, hold up, we just walked your child to school, we walked two miles a day and you lost 30 pounds? Like, that's not fair. And so I think when we start to put movement and we start think differently about the choices we make, suddenly those small aspects end up aggregating to really massive change. We just need to run this experiment for our lifetime.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

Of these, about 30,000 die from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;C. difficile can lurk in hospitals for months because outside of the body the bacteria forms spores that are very hard to get rid of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the UK, data from the country's public health service suggests about 16,000 people are now infected every year — with cases rising in hospitals. About 2,100 die from the infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria is hard to clear from facilities because it can form invisible spores outside the human body that survive for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mild cases, infected patients may suffer frequent bouts of diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in more severe instances, the disease may cause diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day alongside persistent abdominal pain, a swollen abdomen, fever and rapid heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn it can be mistaken for food poisoning, a stomach flu or a normal side effect of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat the infection, doctors may stop administering antibiotics to a patient — leaving time for the patient's immune system and microbiome to target the bacteria and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or they may administer a strong antibiotic — such as Vancomycin or Metronidazole — to kill off the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.2787?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=040425"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took samples from 200 patients who were admitted to two intensive care units over several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of samples were taken, both from patients' skin and from hospital surfaces and the hands of healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were then analyzed for the presence of C. diff, with the bacteria's DNA then decoded to allow researchers to track individual strains throughout the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, they detected the bacteria in about 10 percent of the patients sampled — with C. diff either on a patient's body or in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how often the bacteria was detected among healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed in most cases the bacteria was genetically identical to that of another patient or that found in another room, suggesting the C. diff bacteria from one patient was unknowingly transferred to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found that in &lt;span&gt;more than half of the potential transmission events, the two patients involved were not even in the hospital at the same time — sometimes separated by weeks — demonstrating how persistent the bacteria is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rubin added: 'What I'm hoping we get from this paper is that healthcare providers put a greater emphasis on infection prevention measures and adhere to them as much as they possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those are the measures that can help interrupt this type of invisible transmission.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To kill the bacteria's spores, the Environmental Protection Agency says to use bleach at a 1:10 dilution with water to disinfect surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers added that not all C. diff bacteria cause disease and that in most cases they observed harmless varieties of the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonetheless, they said that the spread of these non-disease-causing bacteria still revealed routes that the more dangerous version could take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:03:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxObXhuYTJZeHdBLUVEZGVIZ0Z5WDVNa1dkbWhjbF9IRmltaVpLYThoZllkaWhmbXBSbUY4bWwxY2F3dm9zWjd3T1YyQkJSSXp6ZFJKUkx3cnV4b2RYb0x3Uk9RSHdaelhiU0x3aWdCMWZETmczZHNYYmFnWWxvcTFhSWlpS1phODR1RXFYcl9UeWtNek1xSFBjQ3dWRkpJd9IBowFBVV95cUxObG12X3pEMC1lTUMzYzhHMF9RdkZETVJPMmM1ekpEWGNvNEQ0aExkS3FiN2ZkaHFLbmRKV3VLTHlZSF9qc1IyRThfT3MycG1MSDZxbTVpYzF4cTN1a243VkpqWkhVRHg1LVpwNGZOblpmbXZ2S1d5MU13VnNlazZOOWpRMWVwaFpuRVNPTklwRVNwSnBvQmNvNFpOWjFCa1pOZlJZ</guid></item><item><title>Hormone-Free Male Birth Control Pill Enters Clinical Trials For The First Time - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOYjZxVnlCNFV1YVhqTlJjSXBVREZVa20wNFJXRXBteHpnSTUwMG5LTFZ5NTR6OEh4STRoMzBGQTI2alRiU0hpUEJJMC1ZZjllSTBnRUZMNWo5dUhsZGFWMmlic1dLNFkxbzBnT3hsVlluYm1tZVJhVHdnV0RmSm53eWdqdkQzMC0yalB0YU14WWlxeEpMOUJyLTdjTkJzN2w0azFIMGhwUzJUU00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A hormone-free male birth control pill is undergoing clinical testing for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, called YCT-529, has performed incredibly well at limiting the production of sperm in mice and non-human primates, all while producing very few side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-attempt-at-a-side-effect-free-male-contraceptive-has-proven-effective-in-mice"&gt;In male mice&lt;/a&gt;, the unique contraceptive kicks in within a month of use, reducing pregnancies in female mates by close to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male macaques require a higher dosage of YCT-529, but it also causes a rapid plummet in sperm count without severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the animals soon regain their fertility when the medicine is stopped. The drug also causes no significant changes in three hormones important for sperm production: testosterone, FSH, or inhibin B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to female hormonal birth control, male birth control that influences sex hormones can produce unwanted side effects, such as weight gain,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, or increased levels of 'bad' cholesterol. In the past, these unforeseen consequences have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-different-stakes-of-male-and-female-birth-control/506120/"&gt;stopped some effective forms&lt;/a&gt; from continuing in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led scientists to try &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/on-demand-male-contraceptive-pill-could-switch-your-sperm-off-for-a-day"&gt;non-hormonal methods&lt;/a&gt; instead, and so far, they are proving &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mens-health/male-birth-control-gel-results-promising-rcna153349"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; for YCT-529 is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110809"&gt;already over and done&lt;/a&gt;, and while we don't yet know the results, they were successful enough that the drug is now entering phase 2, which assesses safety and efficacy. The trial began in &lt;a href="https://www.nzcr.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YCT-529-02-NZCR-PISCF-Phase-1b-v5.0_22Nov24_Clean.pdf"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A safe and effective male pill will provide more options to couples for birth control," &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medicinal chemist Gunda Georg from the University of Minnesota. "It will allow a more equitable sharing of responsibility for family planning and provide reproductive autonomy for men."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg's lab &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110809"&gt;began investigating&lt;/a&gt; YCT-529 years ago because of its impact on a protein called retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha. This receptor interacts with retinoic acid – a metabolite of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; A – to influence cell growth, sperm formation, and embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156933" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/dcp1107_380.png" alt="Sperm Production" class="size-full wp-image-156933" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sperm production produced via retinoic acid (RA). (&lt;a href="https://wi.mit.edu/news/retinoic-acid-regulates-transitions-mouse-sperm-production"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;YCT-529 blocks RAR-alpha, and because it only targets this one version of the receptor, it limits possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing research has since received funding from the National Institutes of Health and brings together scientists from Columbia University, the University of Minnesota, and the pharmaceutical company YourChoice Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Georg and her colleagues said they would have &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; running by 2022. The research is running slower than predicted, but it's still heading in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief science officer and founder of YourChoice Therapeutics, Nadja Mannowetz, &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; their animal studies have "laid the groundwork for human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of YCT-529, which are progressing efficiently."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50 percent in the US and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men," she &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YCT-529 isn't the only non-hormonal male birth control under exploration. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-type-of-reversible-male-contraception-proves-a-success-in-mouse-study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine, tested another compound, called CDD-2807, which stops male mice from siring litters when it is injected. It is not yet undergoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-explains-why-male-birth-control-options-are-so-limited"&gt;male contraceptive&lt;/a&gt; was approved for sale was in the 1980s when scientists figured out how to do a minimally invasive vasectomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(23)00063-X/abstract"&gt;A 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; surveying more than 2,000 male respondents found more than three-quarters were willing to use new contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Women have shouldered the burden of pregnancy prevention for too long," Mannowetz &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/yourchoice-birth-control-pill/?cf-view"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a recent press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Data continue to show that men want to help, and they're willing to try new birth control options. Data also show women trust them to do so.

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, an estimated 645,000 men ages 20 to 50 have azoospermia, a condition in which no sperm are present in their ejaculate. Now, scientists are testing a potential treatment: transplanting sperm-forming stem cells into the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If refined and proven safe, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation could be a revolutionary fertility-restoring technique for men who've lost the ability to produce sperm," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://houmanmd.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://houmanmd.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Justin Houman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be especially helpful for "cancer survivors treated before puberty or men with genetic or acquired testicular failure," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does this experimental treatment involve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/sperm-cells-carry-traces-of-childhood-stress-epigenetic-study-finds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/sperm-cells-carry-traces-of-childhood-stress-epigenetic-study-finds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sperm cells carry traces of childhood stress, epigenetic study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sperm-forming stem cells are at the core of the therapy. These cells, found in the testicles even before puberty, typically mature into sperm when testosterone levels rise during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But medical conditions — like a blockage in the reproductive tract or certain genetic mutations or hormonal problems — and treatments such as chemotherapy can damage these stem cells or block their development into sperm, thus leading to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ABbAXV2BXvdz2KjjZte8dT" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ABbAXV2BXvdz2KjjZte8dT slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a young patient wishes to preserve their sperm-forming stem cells for future use, doctors can use an ultrasound-guided needle to collect the stem cells into the rete testis — a network of small tubes that connects to the seminiferous tubules, where sperm are typically produced. The needle is carefully inserted into these tubes through the base of the scrotum, and once collected, the stem cells are frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, doctors can then reintroduce the preserved stem cells into the rete testis, using a similar, ultrasound-guided technique. The goal is for the cells to implant in the seminiferous tubules, where they can mature and begin producing sperm, mimicking the natural process that occurs during puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This procedure has previously been tested in animals, and it successfully enabled male &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_3113070417814895905&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms5320&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fman-gets-sperm-making-stem-cell-transplant-in-first-of-its-kind-procedure" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5320" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms5320&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fman-gets-sperm-making-stem-cell-transplant-in-first-of-its-kind-procedure" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav2914" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav2914" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;monkeys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to produce sperm and father offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have documented the technique's first use in humans. According to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.25.25324518v1" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.25.25324518v1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;paper published March 26 on preprint server medRxiv&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a man in his early 20s has now received a transplant of his own, once-frozen stem cells. He had his sperm-forming stem cells preserved as a child, before he underwent chemotherapy for bone cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stem-cell transplant is successful, the man's body should begin producing sperm, which was not possible before the procedure due to azoospermia. So far, ultrasounds have confirmed that the transplantation procedure didn't damage the patient's testicular tissue, and his hormone levels are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No sperm have been detected in his semen yet, but the researchers are continuing to analyze his semen twice a year to see if the reproductive cells show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for the lack of detectable sperm, according to the researchers, is that only a small quantity of stem cells were collected in the patient's childhood, to minimize harm to his tissues. That means the number of preserved and transplanted cells capable of developing into sperm remains low. As a result, sperm production may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/oldest-sperm-found.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/oldest-sperm-found.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 million-year-old sperm is the oldest ever found. And it's giant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sperm do not ever appear in the patient's ejaculate but the patient wants to father children, doctors could attempt to recover, via surgery, any small amount of sperm made by the stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/education/fellowships/meet-our-fellows" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/education/fellowships/meet-our-fellows" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Laura Gemmel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive and endocrinology fellow at Columbia University, suggested another alternative: a technique called the Sperm Tracking and Recovery (STAR) System. This is a machine developed at the Columbia University Fertility Center that combines &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technology, robotics, and microfluidics, a technology that uses tiny channels to analyze fluid within a device. This tech identifies and recovers extremely scarce sperm cells from an ejaculate, she told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes only one sperm to conceive a child, Gemmel noted. "If we can find that sperm noninvasively, we can inject that single sperm into an egg and make an embryo," Gemmel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that, "our field has seen success with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2021.278828" target="_blank" data-url="https://haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2021.278828" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ovarian cryopreservation and retransplantation in young girls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with childhood cancers. I'm hopeful that in the future, we can provide an option for young boys who want to one day father a biologic child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all medical procedures, sperm stem cell transplants come with some risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, there's a chance that a fraction of the transplanted stem cells have cancer-causing genetic mutations and could someday develop into a tumor, especially in patients who've had leukemia in the past, Houman said. And even though the procedure uses the patient's own cells, there's a "theoretical risk" that the immune system could still react and trigger inflammation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also ethical concerns around freezing the sperm stem cells from young boys — namely, how can doctors be sure the children can fully consent to the procedure, and that they have clear expectations around the long-term storage of their cells?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to proceed cautiously, and with rigorous oversight," he said. "This is promising science — but it's still early days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-ABbAXV2BXvdz2KjjZte8dT-CL2efvQ8zpJVZvJCwWdxjufS9rAl06uO" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-ABbAXV2BXvdz2KjjZte8dT-CL2efvQ8zpJVZvJCwWdxjufS9rAl06uO slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

James Kinross, a GI surgeon who researches how the gut microbiome affects our risk of the disease, believes "an internal climate crisis" among people in Western countries could be partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "the gift of the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is that you can change it," said Kinross, referring to the trillions of microbes that populate our digestive system, and which research suggests have a wide-ranging affect on our health. "It is an ecosystem that you can adapt," the researcher at Imperial College London told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower his own risk of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;developing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the second deadliest form of cancer disease in the US, Kinross follows dietary principles including eating a vegetarian diet. However, as BI has previously reported, a person's diet is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors such as &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-studies-ultra-processed-foods-rules-to-stop-overeating-simple-2025-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, the use of antibiotics, which kill gut bacteria, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/human-blood-microplastics" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, and limited exposure to nature, are thought to have made our gut microbiomes less diverse, he said. That means it's less healthy and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave the example of a child who is born by C-section, which means missing out on microbes that would have been passed on via the birth canal, to a mom whose gut microbiome is depleted by&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;antibiotics, and fed a diet of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ultra-processed-foods-impact-your-body-calories-weight-gain-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing a generational loss in our internal ecology, which is being hammered with a series of environmental hits that it simply cannot adapt to," Kinross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequence is "a very unhappy microbiome," which produces harmful molecules and toxins that affect colon cancer risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinross shared how he eats to lower his risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

In February, it &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/11/g-s1-47661/trump-musk-usaid-ukraine-south-africa-mexico-colombia-india-afghanistan-hiv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gutted&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Agency for International Development, which plays a crucial role in supplying other countries with HIV treatments. On March 21, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://insidehealthpolicy.com/share/147528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;terminated the Adolescent Trials Network&lt;/a&gt;, or ATN, which is the only national research network focused on adolescents and young adults who live with, or are at risk for, HIV. The National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/31/trump-administration-hiv-research-grant-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;terminated grants&lt;/a&gt; related to PrEP, medications that can prevent HIV infection. And this week, the administration laid off &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scores of workers&lt;/a&gt; at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who focused on HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its formation in 2001, ATN has enrolled more than 30,000 people in over 150 studies, many of which focus on the ongoing HIV epidemic, and expanded access to PrEP. But it has a more expansive remit, also studying the rising incidence of STIs, and mental health and substance abuse disorders in young people. Nevertheless, the network's termination letter used the same language seen in letters from the National Institutes of Health that intend to eradicate "diversity, equity, and inclusion" in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infectious disease epidemiologist Tara Kerin had started working on &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06738407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;an ATN study&lt;/a&gt; focused on the antibiotic doxycycline, which has a growing reputation as a "morning-after" pill for STIs. Last year, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7302a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended &lt;/a&gt;this STI-prevention strategy—called doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis, or doxyPEP—for cis men and transgender women, citing evidence that it has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by 70 percent and gonorrhea by about 50 percent. Although evidence suggests that doxyPEP would be effective in other populations, such as cis women or transgender men, the CDC did not yet have enough clinical data to recommend the drug to these other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ATN study Kerin was attached to aimed to solve that problem—testing if the antibiotic also prevented STIs in adolescent and young cis women. "Women in general are usually left out a lot of studies," Kerin said. "So having this specifically looking at how we can prevent STIs in women would have been really great." But the study was canceled on March 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerin was not a full-time federal employee. But this ATN grant, which was already funded and approved, would have covered most of her salary for the next four years. In fact, ATN projects "have been mostly paying my bills since 2017," she said. Now, the grant's cancellation means Kerin will be out of work in a few months. In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00924-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thousands of scientists&lt;/a&gt; like Kerin depend on grant money from the federal government to pay their salaries. As federal funding for their research is cut, these scientists risk losing their jobs, their labs, and their careers. I spoke with Kerin about how this study would have given a generation of women more control over their health, her fears of a medication-resistant strain of HIV, and why the health of Americans is inextricable from the health of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would love if you could tell me about how you decided to become an infectious disease epidemiologist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually wanted to be a lawyer. And then I took a couple of classes and decided, no, I don't. I don't want to talk about politics all day! Which is hysterically why I thought, oh, I'll go into science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up changing my major. I got a degree in neuroscience and ended up going to Penn State, where I got a degree in bio-behavioral health. I was doing a lot of lab work—you know, the pipetting behind the bench. A couple years later, I ended up getting a job at the CDC. I was working in the rotavirus lab. Rotavirus is basically the stomach flu for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., [rotavirus] is no big deal. It's a pain. I actually think I remember when me and my siblings got it—we were just all basically stuck in the bathroom. But in developing countries, it was a leading cause of childhood death. You get dehydrated, just because they don't have the same resources that we would have. So it was a worldwide problem, even if day-to-day in the U.S. we weren't bothered by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, they also developed a vaccine, which was awesome. I was so excited about this. One thing that is obviously, extremely important is you're never going to get rid of a disease unless you get rid of it worldwide. I think COVID and the Ebola outbreaks that we had more recently have shown that with all of our abilities to travel very quickly, that also means that these diseases travel a lot quicker than they used to. At this point, if there is a disease anywhere, it can be in your backyard within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time when [that] great vaccine was on the market, and—I mean, we're thrilled! Over the moon! You've been working on this virus, and all of a sudden it looks like, in essence you've got a preventative care for it. But as I was driving to work, there would be protest lines. They were people who were anti-vax. This is right around the time when Jenny McCarthy is getting her platform on Oprah. To me, it was just sort of this mind-blowing, like, what? You guys think these are unsafe? What's going on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first ATN study I was on was looking at recently [HIV] infected young adults. HIV is this wildly—I mean, it's kind of cool—wildly smart virus. First it attacks your immune system. It just goes right for the jugular: You can't fight us, because I'm directly going to fight what you fight us with. But now we have these &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antiretrovirals&lt;/a&gt;, right? So you take these pills, and it keeps your detectable level of virus gone. We now know that if you do not have a detectable level of virus—so if you take your pills pretty much every day—you take a blood test and there's no virus. You can't spread it. So you can have sex. You can have babies. You can do all of that stuff that we thought that people with HIV would never be able to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of some children being able to go off the medication, and the virus doesn't appear to come back. The reason why the virus comes back is because it hides. A section of it will hide away in this little reservoir—HIV reservoirs, we call it—so the medication can't get to it there. It just stays there. And it just waits and waits and waits. It'll kind of pop its head out and be like, "All clear?" and then it will, boom. So children who have had HIV, their immune systems are a little bit more pliable. Those reservoirs might be smaller. The idea is, all right, so what if we catch people right when they get sick, these young adults that still have these moldable immune systems, and see if we can shrink these reservoirs so at some point they can go off medication? Because the meds aren't great. I mean, it's like, just take a pill. But they're not just a pill. They have side effects. They have issues. It is a pill, or a set of pills, that you would have to take every day for the rest of your life. So you know, you're looking at the way to eliminate that entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this new one that I'm doing, or &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; doing for the ATN, was on doxyPEP. HIV also has what they call PrEP and PEP. Prep is a pre-sex drug—so pre-exposure prophylactic that you can take so that you are less likely to get HIV. This is great. It's sort of like [a] birth control type of thing. If you can take that, and people who, you know, "Oh, I'm thinking about having sex tonight, I'll take this," then they can be a lot more safe. There's also PEP, and that's the post-exposure. That's something you take within 72 hours, that can also help you, kind of like your plan B pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have found in men, when they've looked, that it can actually prevent a whole bunch of STDs or STIs—oh, really cool. There's this post- thing you can take in 72 hours, and then you don't have to worry about chlamydia or gonorrhea or syphilis or any of that stuff. They've also done some things that have shown if you take doxyPEP before sex, much like PrEP, and again, in men, this is shown that it might be effective as a prep as well as a PEP. But this new trial that we were doing was looking at it in women. Because we don't have any data in women, or not much anyway. So that was what we were working on. And it came from the Adolescent Trial Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a really cool network. It managed to bring sites all over the U.S. If you had an idea for a project and you could get funding, you could also do it within all of these sites. One of the hardest things to do in any study is recruit people. It's a pain. I've tried to be in studies, and I'm like, oh god, this is so hard! This is not worth it! So I understand. And this sort of thing also gets you across the country, so you'll have a population that is more representative. Los Angeles does not necessarily represent the rest of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were millions of dollars in these projects. There are a lot of ATN projects going on over time. There's been a couple hundred since the ATN was formed back in 2008—while ago, somewhere in those early aughts. So that was just completely shut down. It wasn't just the ATN that was shut down, I also work on some other HIV projects to pay my bills. All of those were shut down as well too. They're targeting HIV, which is frustrating on levels not just for me, but for science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grant that was just canceled—you mentioned it was going to cover the next four years of your work. How long had that been covering your work before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It  basically just got started. We had been working on the first part of the study, [which] is getting it ready. We'd been making protocols and manuals and training for staff, and getting an app made. I'm so sad about that app. I feel like that app was a lot of work for a lot of people, and it was really cool. I'm very bummed about that, not ever really getting out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three arms. One was standard of care, which is just STI education, condoms, talking about things, testing. The other one was doxyPEP on demand, so they could ask for it within 72 hours of having sex, and they would get that. And then the third one was we were assigning that group to take the doxyPEP every week, regardless of their sexual activity. So that one was the pills. I just started working on that, I guess, at the end of last summer. We were ready to launch, and I got, on Friday: Stop work completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could [you] briefly cover the work that you had done for the grant, all that you had accomplished thus far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of paperwork to do at the beginning. Getting an institutional review board approval. You've already gotten permission from the NIH, but now you also have to go through another level of scrutiny to make sure that this study is ethical. That you have all of your ducks in a row. You have thought about everything that could possibly happen and making sure you have a plan and a backup plan. How are you going to deal with adverse events?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard of operating procedures—it doesn't sound like a big deal, but, boy, that takes months to get right. Again, all of those things need to be in print, every possible scenario and what you're going to do, and describing the procedure down to the smallest thing. Because, the idea is, if anybody has a question about what to do, they will have an answer. By the time an NIH study gets out and started, it's already been optimized to be a well-oiled machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you have the standard operating procedure. And then every single thing that you're doing has what we call the manual of operations (MOPs) too. I had just written one on all the sample collection. There's one of how to collect hair—how far down? How long does it need to be? Where you need to put it afterward? How does it need to be stored? We were also doing swabs, both throat and rectal or front hole. We had swabs everywhere. We mostly try to encourage those to be self-collected by the participant. But we also need to be able to tell them how to do it. And also be able to tell the staff if they need to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also another one on counseling—how to counsel people for reproductive health, not just giving scripts, but also how to give the resources to everybody that they need. How to treat the STIs once they're found. Where do they need to go? How quickly? How are we making sure that we are keeping these women safe and healthy? We were a little delayed. We were supposed to have launched already, but it got pushed off until April because we had two issues. One, some of our sites were coming from another collective called the &lt;a href="https://www.hptn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HPTN&lt;/a&gt;. That's the HIV trials. It's another HIV collective. And &lt;em&gt;for some reason&lt;/em&gt; they weren't getting the money from the government. So we were like, OK, we're going to have to pause on them. Then we had another issue with the medication supplier, so we had pushed this off just slightly—which I guess, in hindsight, is for the best. Because it'd have been pretty awful to start people on something and then be like—just kidding!—and take it away. They cut us off right before our launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you learn that the grant was cancelled?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in another meeting, and the [principal investigator] of the study called me, which was odd. I mean, it's not odd, but, you know, a little odd. I was like, alright, well, I'm going to decline because I'm in this meeting. But I also just had a weird spidey sense about it. Then she texted me right after, she was just like, call when you can. And I was like, oh, this is not going to be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told me it was canceled. I'm not gonna lie, I knew HIV would be on the chopping block. It deals with populations that a lot of that administration does not like to admit exist. So not a huge surprise. But it was a surprise how quickly it happened. I assumed it might be something where we might not be renewed. But I was not quite prepared for stopping on a Friday in March. I had a good cry, and then I got to take the rest of the day off. And then just started trying to get my ducks in a row. The thing that sucks is everybody is on a hiring freeze right now. And additionally, even pharmaceutical companies that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; hiring have got hundreds of people that are super-qualified going through one [posting]. It's tough. Because I know at the end of the day, I'm probably going to end up taking a job that was for someone who has a master's, and they're going to end up having to take a job for somebody who has a bachelor's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you stop taking medication, the HIV pops out of the little reservoir, and it takes a look and it's like, oh, the pills are gone. Let's get going again. But it's smarter this time, and it becomes resistant to the medication you were taking. This is a problem with people who tend to stop and start their medications a lot. They become resistant to the medications to the point that the medications are a lot less effective. Back in January, when USAID was told to stop giving HIV medications to everybody, my first thought was not just that people are going to die, but: Oh crap, we're going to get a medication-resistant strain of HIV. You're not going to get rid of a disease unless you get rid of it everywhere. So all of that work we've done with HIV to get to the point that as long as you take your medications, you can have a really normal life, that just could be totally blown up, which is also very, very frustrating. It's not something you can take a switch and turn it back around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any recourse for getting another funder to move in [on the grant]? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be missing out on that opportunity of having the network. While this grant hopefully will live on somewhere, somehow, it will be different. And we won't have the same reach that we had with the ATN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these sort of studies are stopped, particularly with this one, we have prevented a generation of being able to have some sort of control over their health in the sexual landscape. And a lot of people, particularly who support the administration, may be like, oh, well, you know, kids shouldn't be having sex anyway. Well, sure. But just like birth control, it's going to happen. And we want to make sure that there's as much safety that goes on—not just with HIV, but syphilis is really bad. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can get really bad. We already know that HPV can cause cancer. These are STIs that can really mess up your life. Sure, there are treatments for these things now. But a lot of times, it's going to have more of an impact long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the grant were to be picked up by another funder, would you be able to return to that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on how and who picks it up. But the bigger problem is that I won't be around. Unless it happens next week, which, even if you get money, it's not immediate. You apply for a grant in April, and you hope to get the money by the next January. I will be long gone at that point. I will not be in the study, but hopefully somebody else would be able to. I've already joked about all the data that I have, and trying to find a really lucky PhD student to go to: Here, analyze all of this and get it out to the world, since I will not be a part of the project!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was curious if there was anything else about this grant or its cancellation, or your fears and concerns that we haven't had a chance to talk about, that you'd want to touch on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the HIV grants. And it's not just all of the other ones that are being stopped. The dismantling of the NIH—and I won't even get into RFK Jr. and all that bullshit—it puts us back for so many years. Because it's not something that, in the next four years, if we get in a different administration, we can just turn this back on. Again, all of these things have been in in the works for years. Particularly if we're going to keep going back and forth on this and having an administration that wants to give money, that doesn't, that does, that doesn't—it is going to hurt our chances of research in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess what I don't really understand is how people can look at this and just be, &lt;em&gt;America first&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;focus on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;America&lt;/em&gt; without realizing how connected we are biologically with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to be the best in the world at this. Without our influence, other places will have the stronger influence. When we lose influence, we lose not just power—we do—we lose ground. We lose the ability to protect ourselves.

State health officials said Tuesday there were 22 new cases of measles since Friday, bringing the total to &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 across 19 counties" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;422 across 19 counties&lt;/a&gt; — most in West Texas. Erath and Brown counties, in the central part of the state, logged their first cases. Forty-two people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced four new cases Tuesday, bringing the state’s total to 48. New Mexico health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. Most are in Lea County, where two people have been hospitalized, and two are in Eddy County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas has 24 cases in six counties in the southwest part of the state as of Wednesday. Kiowa and Stevens counties have six cases each, while Grant, Morton, Haskell and Gray counties have five or fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma logged one new measles case Tuesday — for a total of eight confirmed and two probable cases. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Tulsa and Rogers counties, but wouldn’t say which counties had cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio reported one new measles case Thursday in west-central Allen County. Last week, there were 10 in Ashtabula County in the northeast corner of the state. The first case was in an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In central Ohio, Knox County officials reported two new measles cases in international visitors, for three cases in international visitors total. Those cases are not included in the state’s official count becuase they are not in Ohio residents. A measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases.

It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do you need an MMR booster?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="measles, mumps and rubella" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don’t always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don’t know which type they got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="dangerous complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.
